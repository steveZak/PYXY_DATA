        "wiki": "Tivoli, also known as Tivoli Gardens, is an amusement park and pleasure garden in Copenhagen, Denmark. The park opened on 15 August 1843 and is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world, after Dyrehavsbakken in nearby Klampenborg, also in Denmark.\nWith 4.6 million visitors in 2017, Tivoli is the second-most popular seasonal theme park in the world after Europa-Park. Tivoli is the fifth-most visited theme park in Europe, behind Disneyland Park, Europa-Park, Walt Disney Studios Park and Efteling. It is located directly in downtown Copenhagen, next to the Central rail station for the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe amusement park was first called \"Tivoli & Vauxhall\"; \"Tivoli\" alluding to the Jardin de Tivoli in Paris (which in its turn had been named after Tivoli near Rome, Italy), and \"Vauxhall\" alluding to Vauxhall Gardens in London. It is mentioned in various books, such as Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, and was also used prominently in the 1961 science fiction film Reptilicus. \nTivoli's founder, Georg Carstensen (b. 1812 \u2013 d. 1857), obtained a five-year charter to create Tivoli by telling King Christian VIII that \"when the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics\". The monarch granted Carstensen use of roughly 15 acres (61,000 m\u00b2) of the fortified glacis outside Vesterport (the West Gate) for an annual rent. Until the 1850s Tivoli was outside the city, accessible from the city only through the Vesterport.\nFrom its beginning Tivoli included a variety of attractions: buildings in the exotic style of an imaginary Orient: a theatre, band stands, restaurants and caf\u00e9s, flower gardens, and mechanical amusement rides such as a merry-go-round and a primitive scenic railway. After dark, colored lamps illuminated the gardens. On certain evenings, specially designed fireworks could be seen reflected in Tivoli's lake, a remnant of the moat surrounding the city fortifications.\nComposer Hans Christian Lumbye (b. 1810 \u2013 d. 1874) was Tivoli's musical director from 1843 to 1872. Lumbye was inspired by Viennese waltz composers such as the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I and his sons), and became known as the \"Strauss of the North\". Many of his compositions are specifically inspired by the gardens, including \"Salute to the Ticket Holders of Tivoli\", \"Carnival Joys\" and \"A Festive Night at Tivoli\". The Tivoli Symphony Orchestra still performs many of his works.\n\nIn 1874, a Chinese-style Pantomimeteatret (pantomime theatre) took the place of an older smaller theatre. The audience stands in the open, the stage being inside the building. The theatre's \"curtain\" is a mechanical peacock's tail. From the very beginning, the theatre was the home of Italian pantomimes, introduced in Denmark by the Italian Giuseppe Casorti. This tradition, dependent on the Italian Commedia dell'Arte, has been kept alive; it portrays the characters Cassander (the old father), Columbine (his beautiful daughter), Harlequin (her lover), and, especially popular with the youngest spectators, the stupid servant Pierrot. The absence of spoken dialogue is an advantage, for Tivoli is now an international tourist attraction.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Tivoli also hosted human exhibitions.In 1943, Nazi sympathisers burnt many of Tivoli's buildings, including the concert hall, to the ground. Temporary buildings were constructed in their place and the park was back in operation after a few weeks.Tivoli is always evolving without abandoning its original charm or traditions. Georg Carstensen said in 1844: \"Tivoli will never, so to speak, be finished\", a sentiment echoed just over a century later when Walt Disney said of his own Tivoli-inspired theme park, \"Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.\"\nIn Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the word tivoli has become synonymous with any amusement park.\n\n\n== Rides ==\n\nThe park is best known for its wooden roller coaster, Rutschebanen, or as some people call it, Bjergbanen (The Mountain Coaster), built in 1914. It is one of the world's oldest wooden roller coasters that is still operating today. An operator controls the ride by braking so that it does not gain too much speed during descent of the hills. It is an ACE Coaster Classic.Another roller coaster, The Demon (D\u00e6monen), features an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, and a zero-G roll all during the ride time of just one minute and forty six seconds. An old roller coaster, The Snake (Slangen), was removed to have enough space for The Demon. In 2017, Tivoli Gardens added an optional virtual reality experience to the ride, simulating a flight through ancient China, along with encounters with dragons and demons. The Demon is situated next to the concert hall.\nA well-known swing ride, The Star Flyer, opened in Tivoli in 2006. 80 metres (260 feet) high and built by the Austria based Australian company Funtime, it offers panoramic views of the city.On 1 May 2009, Tivoli Gardens opened the new ride Vertigo, a looping plane ride where the rider pilots the ride, able to control the plane.\nA Zamperla Air Race ride, Aquila, opened on 11 April 2013. It is a giant swing and spinner with centrifugal powers up to 4 g, named after the constellation of the Eagle.The newest attraction is Fatamorgana, which opened in 2016. This is the world's first Condor 2GH, which offers two separate seating arrangements, one milder version with two-seater gondolas, and a thrilling version in which riders are slung around at high speed while seated in a ring and facing away from the center.\n\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n\n\n=== Other rides ===\nAquila - giant swing and spinner ride that opened in 2013; with centrifugal powers up to 4 g; height limit 1,2 m.\nThe Bumper Cars - classic bumper cars that date from 1926.\nFatamorgana - a 43 m (141 ft) tall hybrid Condor ride that opened in 2016.

          "Every tourist brochure touts Tivoili to the skies. It's the Mona Lisa of Copenhagen, but not half as interesting. That doesn't keep the crowds from flocking there, Danes and tourists alike. Pay Disney World- or Great America- prices to go to a (granted, old) amusement park",

          "When we first arrived in Copenhagen (in February) the Tivoli Gardens were closed. However they opened for a short time at the end of our stay. What a magical and beautiful place to visit. A very special place to visit and very close to Central Copenhagen Railway Station. The",
          "We used the Copenhagen card to get into Tivoli Gardens with our four year old. It is so close to the station as it appears on the map and is literally in the middle of the high street. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe opposite before entering, not realising there were so many",
          "Whilst visiting Copenhagen in October we went to Tivoli Gardens. Lovely setting, it was decorated for Halloween and rides were fun.",

          "We came here over Christmas during a long weekend. The park itself is a bit of a maze/tardis and we did get lost a couple of times. When we were there in mid December it was very busy with locals and tourists. It meant the ride queues were long. The place itself though is",
          "This is considered as the oldest amusement park in Europe, and is located smack in the center of Copenhagen, right across from the central train station. The park is open till late at night. My wife and daughter enjoyed the rides during the day, and I joined them in the evening.",
          "We went at the end of the winter season before the park closes for a while. The theme felt a bit like Christmas, strange at the end of February! The park is a 'bit of a tardis', feeling much larger than you would imagine. I also thought it seemed a lot posher and modern than I",
          "Totally bizarre place but loved every minute. Not sure how it can plug Christmas all the way through to late Feb but it works. Intrigued as to what it\u2019s all replaced with next week.",

          "There is enough going on to last the whole day. Also, the atmosphere is quite relaxing, considering the size. I didn't try any of the rides myself but the kids - and accompanying adults - loved them. Finally, there is a good variety of places to eat - including a restaurant",

          "The gardens are closed for a \u201cprivate event\u201d. I can\u2019t believe that the city of Copenhagen would allow such a popular tourist attraction to be closed like this. Ridiculous. Obviously tourism does not matter to the city.",
          "Wow what an awesome park this is, it's got everything for all ages. It looks as though it's been designed by Willy Wonka, the rides are very ornate in their detailing. Theres a roller coaster, duelling planes, Japanese Garden, a pirate ship on a lake, a stage where shows are",
          "Our day at Tivoli was my favourite of our holiday in Copenhagen. We went during December when it was decorated for Xmas making it even more magical. It's worth getting a stamp so you can free re-entry to experience it in the day and lit up at night.",
          "Bought tickets on line clearly specifying dates in Jan.2020 midweek.received etickets within moments Now the day before we want to go-discover they are closed until end Jan 2020 How can they sell tickets with specified dates and THEY ARE CLOSED????",
          "We went there in the evening in mid December to see the Christmas lights. We just walked around and did not go on any amusement rides. The lights and displays we great. Since we went on one of the busiest times, all the restaurants were booked. Plan ahead and make",
          "Tivoli looks magical and inviting from the outside. We visited in December and Tivoli Gardens was beautifully decked out for Christmas. We weren\u2019t that interested in rides but enjoyed seeing the various rides available and watching the fun. Great atmosphere. Lots of food",
          "Lots to do and see in the splendidly stiles Tivoli Gardens. We went at night which was very special. Still lit up with Christmas lights. Thrills for teenagers and highlights for lovers of old style carnival sideshows. Not cheap but neither is Copenhagen.",
          "This is where Disney picked up many ideas. It is old school amusement park with some excellent rides suitable for children for 1 - 99 years old. We enjoyed the Aquila and Demon quite a bit. There are plenty of places to eat as well as games, shows, little boutique stalls, etc. A",
          "Went there after Christmast, had a nice wintery atmosphere and beautiful lights.Loads of little shops and food in addition to the carousels and roller coasters.",
          "We absolutely love Tivoli. Really great food in the food court. Not like an American food court! Nice restaurants, although, I would choose the food court over them since it has opened. Good selection of rides from young kid aged to super scary or thrilling! Scary for me!",
          "You cannot miss Tivoli if you visit Copenhagen. It's one of the oldest amusement parks in the world, and it's a magical place. I've been here twice now - once in summer and once in winter. I recommend either time. The summer weather is wonderful and the Danish days last forever,",
          "I've traveled to many countries, and to many amusement parks. No where have I seen such a transformation of an amusement park from Summer to Winter. Tivoli is NIGHT and DAY. In summer, it's a classic first-in-the-world park. In Winter, it is a fairy-tale, with lifelike snow,",
          "Tivoli Gardens at Christmas time is gorgeous. My husband and I loved all the Christmas decorations and thoroughly enjoyed taking our time and strolling through the park. It\u2019s easy to see why Walt Disney got his inspiration from this place. We didn\u2019t go on any of the rides, but",
          "We were lucky enough to be staying at The Nimb which entitled us to free entry and wristbands for Tivoli on New Years Eve and New Years Day. New Years Eve was magical. Cold crisp and really atmospheric. Tivoli really is a feast for the eyes. Snow, lights, beautiful shops bars",
          "We heard so much about Tivoli but were very disappointed when actually going there. It is just a very expensive Luna Park (as in Sydney) and with a price tag of $70 Australian for two to enter and this was entry only, no rides. Maybe for people with children and more money",
          "Lots to do, lots and lots to eat and unique shops in beautiful surroundings. A true winter wonderland... loved it!",
          "If you love Christmas, I highly recommend a visit during the Christmas season (starts mid-November!). The lights are amazing and the hot chocolate makes the journey more comfortable! I highly recommend buying the Copenhagen Card for three days, which includes Tivoli Gardens.",
          "Everyone knows about Tivoli, so on our first day, we decided to spend the day there, it was just before Christmas, and really magical, fake snow everywhere, which my son enjoyed using, to make snowballs, to throw at me ha ha, Christmas market stalls, Christmas trees, and games",
          "My wife and I attended after Christmas just before it closed for the season, it was a lovely experience, magical in fact. This surely is a must for any families with children before or after Christmas, it was just spectacular, there were plenty of rides for those who enjoy them,",
          "Gorgeous place! Magnificent, we were all amazed. The rides are ok, I guess most of them are better for children over 8 years old. But it\u2019s really expensive.",
          "Not a tourist trap as some blogs claim. A truly unique danish experience. Bring lunch in and sit on the lawns or benches and take in all the people having fun. A great place to people watch.",
          "They definitely know how to do Christmas. Lots of Christmas shops and local food. It was absolutely magical.",
          "Used our hop on hop off Tickets and paid a little extra to include the entrance to the Tivoli. Nice warm welcome from the uniformed concierge which is a nice touch from a guest engagement perspective. Although no snow, Tivoli had sprayed some strategic cover around the",
          "We came on the 4th, the day before it closed for the season. We bought the unlimited ride passes and easily made our money back by going on the demon roller-coaster twice and many other rides. The little ferris wheel was very cute, especially at sunset. We also went to the",
          "Tivoli Gardens in the winter time really is a magical winter wonderland, we were totally blown away by it! We were staying in Copenhagen from 30th Dec 19 to 3rd January 20 and visited the Tivoli Gardens a couple of times, one of them being New Years Eve. The garden is massive,",
          "100% recommend this. Try day and night especially at Christmas time. We did not go on the rides but still feel that we had value for money",
          "Interesting venue in the middle of the city of Copenhagen. Somewhat expensive to enter, since rides are extra. Park is nice and very clean. Food was good and prices were better than expected. I was able to walk the park with a handicap walker and weather was decent. People",
          "Double Check the Dates you are going to make sure they are open! I had assumed that because they were an amusement park, they'd be open all the time but when we went they were closed.",
          "I guess visiting Tivoli is a must if you visit Copenhagen but as we don't like rides, there wasn't really anything else to do there.",
          "We spend one afternoon in Copenhagen and of course we went to the Tivoli. Great fun for all ages, lots of rides, the place looks amazing with all the winter decorations and lights. There is a entrance charge plus a charge for the rides. To buy the wrist band to get access to all",
          "Well, if you want to feel like a big kid again, or have children this is the place for you. The price is reasonable to get in 15DKK and then your in a Wonderland of asumements, sights, shops and food! We didnt go on any of the rides, that not for us, but the experience of",
          "Tivoli Gardens is a hoot...no two ways about it. We walked from our Nyhavn Hotel to the Gardens and loved the sights along the thoroughfare. The Gardens were much more upbeat and revitalized since last I'd seen them in the mid-eighties. People seem to be having a marvelous time",
          "We decided to visit Tivoli before the weekend crowds made it too manic. It was only a few minutes walk away and was quite lovely, decorated for winter and lit up. The crowds were bearable and it was very nice to have a wander around, fortified by a warming Irish Coffee. I'd",
          "Went at Christmas and lighting and stalls made for a nice atmosphere. Did not do the rides, which looked scary enough for the thrill seekers, interesting to move between the different areas, a bit like Epcot at Disney.",
          "I went to Tivoli on 01/01/20 at 6pm. It was beautiful and Christmasy with lights, trees, sleighs and snow. The rides were much quieter at this time and we didn\u2019t queue at all! Would recommend going even if you don\u2019t like rides, paying the \u00a310-\u00a315 to wander around and enjoy the",
          "I went there on New Year\u2019s Eve with my boyfriend. We spent about 4 hours there. There\u2019s nothing that you could wish for there other than some heat \ud83d\ude02. There\u2019s something there for everyone, thrill seekers, families, bars, food hall, hot chocolate and coffee stands, all kinds of",
          "The Gardens are fun even if you dont plan on going on rides. A surprisingly large site, lots of lights, shops, food and drink.",
          "We had yet another magical fun evening in twinkly lights, great food , wonderful shopping and thoroughly entertained teenagers on roller coasters. Every time it's better than the last....pre book tickets to avoid the massive entrance line !",
          "This is the ONE Place/Park to visit during Christmas season when in Copenhagen !!!! Absolutely a fantasy of lights, small lake, Luna park , street food ... children and parents are all a gang for fiesta !!! After all this is the land of Hans Christian Andersen. RECOMMENDED.",
          "We decided to visit on New Years Day with most of the attractions open and arrived late afternoon. This was impressive until it turned dark and then it was a different level - the lighting and style (art deco) of the park was outstanding. It cost less than I was expecting just",
          "We went for New Year\u2019s Eve, had a fabulous time. Got straight in by scanning our barcodes. If you\u2019re in Copenhagen it\u2019s a must xx",
          "Absolutely stunning with all the Christmas decorations and fake snow. We went on New Year\u2019s Eve with our one year old. We bought entrance only and no rides. Yes it\u2019s pricey but Copenhagen in general is pricey and it\u2019s no worse! And it\u2019s just stunning! We bought a few hot drinks",
          "Had a magical new year's eve at Tivoli. Would recommend to anyone. Negative side of course was the temperature but some warm gl\u00f8gg or whiskey can easen it. And don't worry, there's everything for the younger ones too.",
          "My first time in Copenhagen & first solo trip. Made it at 8.30pm New years eve, so much to see here, lots of rides, rollercoaster, food stalls, little Christmas villages too. Watched the fireworks at 11pm, beautiful atmosphere then most of us left to make it to the town square",
          "For real YOU HAVE TO DO IT ! On Christmas time looks amazing it\u2019s a dreamy place to go, the food, the drinks, the things that they sells, everything is good!",
          "We did not go on any rides, but there was plenty to look at and do. Ate at an American Diner. Good, but as all things in touristville, not cheap. There are outdoor stands where you can get food to go. Also saw a marshmallow stand, which I meant to get back to, but got distracted",
          "We were not convinced by the 20-pound entrance fee (that does not include any rides) but ultimately went for it, based on the history of the place. However, we felt it was far too touristy for us and not as historic as we thought",
          "The parc is really beautifully made, especially at night in the Christmas atmosphere. But it is a beautifully made fair with screaming children and fairground attractions. I thought the parc itself would be more serene, I guess I did not do my homework when I booked these",
          "Wow what can I say a beautiful Christmas market /wonderland Iv been to several Christmas markets but Tivoli was magical every building was lit up and there was a film show. On display which was so cute for children about fairy\u2019s tin men and a ballet dancer was so cute",
          "We were delighted to receive tickets for The Tivoli Gardens as a Christmas present. We spent all afternoon and part of the evening gazing a the exquisite, stunning and spectacular Winter Wonderland. This is a truly amazing place to visit at Christmas time and although we did",
          "Full of beautiful Christmas markets and when everything is lit up it is amazing to see. There was a swarovski Christmas tree which was just beautiful. Definitely worth a visit. So lovely",
          "We got to Tivoli on the first day of their Halloweenified set up, it was great! So much decoration and themed rides as well. The only thing that\u2019s an issue is security for most rides you can\u2019t take anything with you and you have to place it in open sort of cubby holes and there",
          "Tivoli Gardens is a great place to visit especially in the Christmas season. there always something to see or experience there",
          "Went there with full Christmas decoration and night market, but didnt get chance to try the amusement park' The place is nice to walk around with all the light, and many small shop for Christmas decoration",
          "We toured the gardens and did a little shopping (although prices are higher there than you would get out side the gardens). The gardens were beautiful and in full bloom. Not very crowded at the time we were there. Had dinner as a group event at the Nimb Brasserie and was very",
          "We took the little one for a quick breakaway and this made our day! If you want to get into the Xmas spirit you can not be disappointed. Food & drink stalls, rides, lanterns. A must see if visiting the city. Happy new year!",
          "We we're told that it was 15 Euro entrance which was true but it's just to enter the park. If you want to get in any attraction you have to buy separate tickets or you can buy an all in ticket at the cashier. So that was a bit off a disappointment, because we were in the",
          "When I saw the map of Tivoli Garden, it was quite small. I thought that I would my visit very quick. Finally I spent a whole day until 9pm with my kids. The garden was beautiful and the rides were great for both adults and kids. I would like to tell all parents don't miss the",
          "It was great to finally be here! We wandered the whole park, bought some souvenirs, and chose the Fru Nimb for supper. Then we went to the pantomime show to finish off the day!",

          "Spent Christmas week in Copenhagen, and a large portion of Christmas Day in Tivoli (We planned this because most cultural sites and stores in Copenhagen are shut down on 12/24 and 12/25) . This place is beautifully decorated and Christmas themed throughout. Lots of \"Christmas",
          "Definitely worth visiting, there's a lot going on in such a small area, rides, gardens, cafes, restaurants, Christmas Market, huts and stalls everywhere, it's not cheap to get in but the experience is worth it xx",
          "We went to Tivoli Gardens mid December at night it was totally amazing so magical easy to navigate around so much to see and do and all the staff including the shop and food stores were so friendly and helpful will definitely go again but will take the grandchildren next time",
          "Amazing place especially in December :) Everything is so shinny and magical! Gluhwine, hot chocolate and food are great and try it after exciting rides.",
          "We absolutely loved it here! At Christmas it was absolutely magical. Must go at night to see the lights. We just ate at the food hall area and it was good. Highly recommend coming here!",
          "This was an amazing place, went on an excursion from the cruise ship. Looked like winter wonderland as we had no snow the whole place had been showered in artificial snow it looked amazing, had a lovely mulled wine with rum to keep the cold out of course.",
          "This is marketed as one of the \"must see\" attractions in Copenhagen so we consequently planned for a morning visit but we were surprised and slightly disappointed that the gardens did not open until 11a.m. So we had to kill an hour before entering with our Copenhagen Cards.",
          "Having previously bought the tickets allowed us to avoid the long lines. Entry was quick and efficient. Tivoli is a wonderful experience that is well organised and a pleasure. Christmas added to the magic. Highly recommend.",
          "This was by far one of the most interesting places we visited in Copenhagen and is unlike any amusement park we have been to. We went in the evening and were able to see a ballet performance, eat dinner at one of the restaurants on the grounds and see all of the lights. This is",
          "The views of the city while riding various rides were incredible. We had a wonderful, romantic time at Tivoli Gardens.",
          "It\u2019s an amusement park with thrill rides. Cost about US$70 for entry fee and unlimited rides. US$20 for entry fee only. Touted as a place to see lights. Ok, but crowded. You can easily admire the lights from outside. WILL NOT GO AGAIN!",
          "The Danes rave about Tivoli Gardens so maybe my expectations were high! I found it pretty and twee but rather over rated. Also expensive for an entry fee (but this is Denmark!) That said everything was pretty from the hyaciths in the gardens which also smelt divine to the",
          "If you are planning to go to Tivoli Gardens then buying tickets in advance is worthwhile. There is a small financial saving (about \u00a33) but we were able to go in without queueing. Some days had very long queues!!! Booking online was very easy. But do watch out for t&cs. Our",
          "My partner and I decided to enter Tivioli mid afternoon expecting to be there for a few hours. We were so wrong, we ended up spending most of the night there. The place was amazing at Christmas, with all the lights and decorations made the experience extra special. We decided to",
          "We went there for the Christmas market and as usual this is so nice, However, you should expect a lot of people in a fairly small area - but we knew. It is so cozy with all the small houses and all the Christmas lights. A visit worth for sure!",
          "A very charming place, beautiful gardens, nice restaurants, amusements rides, concerts, fireworks, a must when in Copenhagen.",
          "A little to many people with long lines for everything Maybe wrong time of the year to visit for us, there are so many other attractions in Copenhagen to see and enjoy",
          "in the heart of copenhagen is Tivoli. The perfect amusement park in city center. Now open as a very awesome christmas market",
          "Tivoli is always an incredible experience! This October, we went on the rainiest day, and also the first day of the Halloween experience. It was truly beautiful experience, and the rain didn't negatively impact our day. All of the rides were open, and there were essentially",
          "We arrived from the morning and spent our day and night here. The Christmas decorations are very beautiful and every corner of the place is filled with the Christmas spirit. We tried almost all the rides, my girl was having a lot of fun and already said she wants to come",
          "We went to the gardens in the evening to see the Christmas market. It was beautiful, the lights we wonderful and there was a light show on the lake with fountains and lasers. Great! Would definitely go back, but beware its hard to get a seat in the restaurants.",
          "Really quirky park, interesting mix of old and new. Loved the old wooden roller coaster, the guys who drive it need a special mention, unbelievable skill and very nonchalant showboating. Very nicely dressed up for christmas too. The prices seem expensive but then it's no worse",
          "As one of many Club members of Tivoli my family and I often visit Tivoli to take a relaxed stroll in this unique, beautiful amusement park/city garden. All though it was raining that late afternoon where we met for our traditional holiday gathering (Hanukkah/Christmas) we really",
          "I hope this finds the right people: We had such a great time as a family here went on rides had hot chocolate and mulled wine was magical during the Christmas market time. We stopped by to have Fish and Chips at the little shop near the \"big boy\" rides. We paid within 3",
          "Very lovely place, its always good to be on a roller coaster even if you think you\u2019re too old for it, very beautiful illumination at night, perfect for couples or families with kids.",
          "One must say the Danes know how to celebrate Christmas. Tivoli gardens is a wonderful place to visit during Christmas. The entire place is transformed into a beautiful winter wonderland. My teenage daughter had a great time on the rides. A very memorable visit!!",
          "It was not snow but even though was so lovely. We could smell the Christmas spirit all around. It is much better to go in the afternoon that all the lights are on and you can have some churros and a yummy hot chocolate.",
          "Always a great market in Tivoli, with lots of nostalgia. Beautiful lights, and plenty to see. Lots of food and drinks options, and some exciting rides as well. Will definitely get you in the Christmas spirit.",
          "Although fairly expensive for entry and all the rides it is still well worth the visit. The staff really helpful, the stalls amazing and food variety excellent. Glad I visited",
          "During a pre-cruise visit to Copenhagen we spent a Saturday evening, in fact the Saturday evening before Halloween at Tivoli. This 20-acre garden is chock full of entertainment and food options. Because it was Halloween it was decked out with thousands of pumpkins, and there",
          "A big theme park but very much a Christmas market during the winter. The glogg is good and good hall has decent food options. Didn\u2019t do the rides but worth visiting for a couple hours.",
          "I visited after Christmas market opened. Although the market itself was meh, the decorated gardens were breathtaking!",
          "It was very pretty at night. I\u2019m going to head back in daylight to better see the old amusement area.. Make sure you check which entrance you need as we ended up walking around the entire perimeter to get to the one we needed! Book a restaurant if you know you\u2019ll want to eat",
          "Went here on a December evening and it was great as it was nicely decorated in preparation for xmas with lots to see and do. Fairground rides and traditional fairground games for children, a small arcade also. Eateries, bars and market stalls for adults. I can understand some of",
          "Tivoli is a magic place with such a Christmas atmosphere, I can only recommend it. Our tour guide told us it is where Walt Disney got the inspiration for Disney world parks and I can see why. If you're planning to do more rides, it will be probably best to take the Unlimited",
          "We went in not really understanding what it was. Didn't get ride tickets because I was with my Australian family and it was way too cold for us to think rollercoasters would be fun. But.... the decorations, the winterland, the stalls, the coziness. And the kids even went on some",
          "I visited the wine bar and asked the waiter if he could clean the table as it was very dirty. He told me to shut up and do it myself. Since it was the only available table, we did. I ordered to sandwiches from the menu and another waiter said it would be done in 15 min. After 15",
          "What an amazing place at Christmas. Outside is surrounded by food courts including wagamama. Inside is a dream. Was really pretty lit up for Christmas. You walked through a winter wonderland! Christmas markets inside to sip mulled wine or baileys hit chocolate (around 50dkk)",

          "Lovely place to wander around, try a few rides although if you want to go in every ride get the unlimited pass otherwise it gets expensive. Saw the ballet while we were there and it was amazing well worth going",

          "I was on a business trip to Denmark staying at the Copenhagen Island hotel just 15 minutes walk away from these gardens. With a colleague I spent only 45 minutes there - but what a nice experience! The market was extensive, selling quality and varied gifts and the lights were",
          "We went early in the evening and the crowds were not too bad - the following night we walked past long lines a little later in the evening waiting to go in - so perhaps better to go early. It was beautiful with Christmas lights and markets - lots to eat say and do. The rides and",
          "We spend one full evening in Tivoli. It's awesome and keep 3-4 hrs in hand to enjoy and complete the full Tivoli. Various activities inside and places to eat. Though a bit costly but if you have money you can enjoy. The entry is free through Copenhagen Card but rides are",
          "Wasn't quite what we were expecting, but there again, if you haven't been before you wouldn't know what to expect! Lovely set up with wood cabins selling all things Christmas. Wonderful fountain and light show on the lake. Decorations and lights throughout were second to none.",

          "What can I say totally beautiful place to visit a must if going to Copenhagen we spent over 5 hours here. I was in 7th heaven everywhere you looked was magical decorated for Christmas. At first I thought it was going to be small but I was proved wrong. We never went on the",
          "Bought a family day ticket and visited twice, once in the morning and then returning to see the lights in the evening. Charming place. Some nice bars serving mulled wine and cake, an excellent food hall, lovely gardens, and the lights over the lake a night were magical.",
          "A great day out to get you into the Christmas spirit. I would recommend an evening walk around the park to see it at its twinkling best. The Christmas tree adorned with real Swarovski crystals is a must see!",
          "We held out trip back as we had wanted to just walk through Tivoli gardens. We ended up going at night. The lights are amazing. The work it takes to transform the place is so worth it. Did not take any rides. But just walking round alone was so good. Lots of glogg and",
          "Tivoli's Christmas market is an important place to visit during Christmas. At Tivoli there is much to do for both children and adults. During the Christmas market, all carousels are open even though it is in the middle of winter. This year, one of the main attractions during the",
          "I haven\u2019t laughed so much in so long, this place was great. Started off in the funhouse which isn\u2019t just for kids, went on every ride we could. Highlight was the wooden coaster with the onboard drivers, very unique. The airplane ride was pretty intense, I think it\u2019s the most",

          "Danish people seem to love Tivoli. The queen takes part in organising children\u2019s plays here and everyone seems to have fond memories of being a child at Tivoli. The entrance queues were long but moved quickly and when we got inside it felt like we\u2019d opened the door into Narnia.",

          "Each season of the year it's a different experience. It's soo beautiful, and full of variety. The stuff is also very polite and welcoming. They have many different events included in the entrance price - you just need to keep an eye on their facebook page for what's happening on",
          "Wonderful old park,lots to see and do. The grounds are over the top. Several quiet places to rest and eat.",
          "Do this if you can. At Christmas it is a hoot and a half. 130 kr to get in, lots of food options, and lovely to stroll with a cup of hot chocolate or glass of wine! At night it is best, especially with the lights of the Swarovski Christmas tree!",
          "I'm not sure if it was due to the time of day that we visited, but we did not feel that Tivoli lived up to the hype. Perhaps if we had visited at night to see it lit up for Christmas we might have felt differently.",
          "This place is spectacular. Visited in December for the Christmas vibe and wasn't disappointed. The way the park is decorated and set up was great. Very clean too no litter being thrown everywhere and the public toilets are something you can use... not like theme parks back here",

          "Visited Tivoli Gardens mid-week (Tuesday) during the last week of November and could not fault the place one bit! The park was all done up for Christmas spectacularly, not a detail was missed. Nice and quiet too which made our day much better as all the rides were open which is",

          "Move over scarefest or fright nights... Tivoli know how to do Halloween! Would recommend going at this time of year as the decorations and themes around were great. Queues were quite long, but we were able to get our moneys worth of rides.",
          "We were in Tivoli Gardens to eat at a restaurant in the park and did not go on any of the attractions due to the rain. We did walk around and can say that with the right weather this place would be a lot of fun. Shopping, food, amusement rides and entertainment add to the",
          "Absolutely mesmerised by the beauty of this park. No wonder the great Walt himself drew inspiration from Tivoli. Totally wonderful in its theming. The rides are brilliant and quaint/quirky too! Whilst plenty for the thrill seekers amongst us too! Can\u2019t fathom why people gave",
          "We came here on our last day as we couldnt visit Copenhagen and not visit one of its number one attractions. We came in October and it had been dressed up for Halloween and looked amazing! Like with any amusement park its a tad expensive and queuing can be long.",
          "Tivoli Gardens is beautiful. Our visit was fun and entertaining with shows and music. There are heaps to see and do. Lots of places to explore. Yummy food! We enjoyed a fantastic time.",
          "The property is enchanting especially when lit up at night & there's lots of trendy restaurants nearby",
          "I went with my husband and 20 month old child. We absolutely loved it. It was decorated for Halloween and they certainly know how to decorate the place, the atmosphere was electric and my daughter found it fascinating. Although on the pricey side (I don't like rides) i would",
          "I honestly can not say enough good things about Tivoli! We arrived at 11:30am and didn't leave until 9:30pm because there was so much to do! after entry you have to pay \u00a328 for an unlimited rides wrist band but honestly it was worth it! We tried to pretty much go on everything",
          "I'm sure it is fun during the day but at night it is just magic. We were there when it was decorated for Halloween and it was even more special. You don't have to ride to have fun as it is great just to walk around or find somewhere to eat and watch it all happening around you.",
          "Tivoli is definitely with a visit for both halloween, Christmas and summer concerts! The Park is cozy and have some nice quite areas, where you can have a warm drink while looking at the lights agter dark!",
          "We went the last evening of the season before it closed for fall. There was a loud pop music concert not to my taste and we somehow missed the light show on the lake. It's pretty but awfully dated.",
          "We love Tivoli! As a family and as a couple it\u2019s perfect for a complete day of fun, or just some hours of enjoyment.",
          "Visited here on a Friday evening in October as was open for Halloween. I didn\u2019t bother with the rides but it is still worth the visit simply for the walk around and to see everything beautiful light up at night. Also loads of places to eat and drink",
          "Visiting lovely Copenhagen with my girlfriend (33 and 32), without kids, visiting Tivoli \u2018gardens\u2019 was the biggest mistake we made. To be honest, we were in doubt. Paying roughly 20 Euro\u2019s pp for a theme-park where you pay for each ride within the park...that could not be true",
          "What an amazing time to go to Tivoli. The Halloween decorations were exquisite. I had an amazing time especially since I went after 6pm & was able to see it Lit Up!!",
          "We visited Tivoli in October. The decorations were wonderful. Our kids, 11,13, 21 all enjoyed the rides and the decor. Our daughter studying in Copenhagen for just the semester got a season pass just to enjoy walking around during the different seasonal changes there. I don\u2019t",
          "Quite expensive to get in and then you have to pay for rides. The gardens were nice but very small and the whole place was quite crowded. I felt like I was paying for entry to a small garden where the main attractions were restaurants that you then had to pay a lot to eat at.",
          "We had sm\u00f8rrebrod at Fru Nimb, excellent, then a nice walk around Tivoli, which was crowded even it was Friday afternoon.",
          "Very disappointing. We arrived towards evening and the park was dark. A short, simple laser show and crowds of visitors standing and hiding and seeing nothing. The price is horribly expensive and unjustified. You can definitely give up. There is nothing to compare to other parks",
          "If you buy your tickets online there is no requirement for this ticket as well. It does not skip the queues in the park but only the queue to get in.",
          "If you're an adult without kids planning to see Tivoli, pay for entrance fee only if you're not an adrenaline fan. The rides fall into two categories: adrenaline and kids and if you decide you want on a ride on spot, you can still buy the ticket for the ride inside. There are",
          "Larger signage would be appreciated. First time visiting Copenhagen and I noticed that signage and directions are lacking. The park was decorated in a Halloween theme. At night the lanterns and lights were pretty. Many cute shops and vendors selling snacks and drinks. Nice",
          "We went and paid for a ticket without the rides, worth staying till it gets dark to see the lights, very busy.",
          "We went to Tivoli Gardens for Halloween. There were a lot of very fun rides for all ages. There was a good selection of restaurants to choose from and the food was delicious. The only bad thing was after a few hours, the queues were very long for most of the rides.",

          "Me and my partner visited here in October when it was decorated for halloween. It exceeded our expectations and pictures on the internet do not do it justice. It felt really magical and the rides were really great. I would 100% recommend this place at this time of year for",

          "This is a great theme park and it was nicely done for Halloween my family really liked it however it is very expensive and unfortunately the adults have to pay to take a under 2 on the rides on top of paying for them and the eye watering entry fee as well I think they need to",

          "We visited on a busy Saturday shortly after Tivoli had re-opened after its brief closure to decorate for Halloween. The park had a great buzz about it; it was busy with families and adults but not uncomfortably full. The decorations for fall and Halloween were really lovely",
          "We spent our last night in Copenhagen in this classic theme park. The theme is Halloween as per current season. Older than Disney world. I like how they kept it simple and did not try to do too much. There are several rides and many food options to choose from. It is more",

          "If you haven't visited Tivoli Gardens, you haven't visited Copenhagen at all! When you are not into high speed activities or quick ups and downs you can just enjoy the beautiful and dreamlike area and atmosphere. They also offer rides for weak minds - so don't be afraid! People",
          "Tivoli Gardens is rather small, yet perfectly located theme park with lots of attractions geared mostly towards younger crowd. There are several more chilling rides as well. Excellent dining options inside. You do not feel you are in the centre of a bustling city.",

          "Overall, the tickets are expensive but you get not only entry to the park but access to the rides as well. There are a couple of excellent roller coasters packed into limited space. Other rides found in amusement parks can be found here as well. There are parks and something",
          "I really enjoyed Tivoli Gardens. It is interesting, fun, relaxing and pretty among other things. There is a lot to do. You could spend a whole day there easily and night is special because of the lights. Fireworks at midnight. I do not know if this happens every day or certain",

          "We were there on a Saturday evening and enjoyed some really good performances: music and also modern dance. As the sun went down and lights lit T\u00edvoli was really beautiful. It\u2019s not Disneyworld, but has its own charm.",
          "Kids liked it. I was a bit put off by the cost I am afraid! Cost a lot to get in and for the rides.I would recommend getting the pass to allow unlimited access and spending all day there. We tried to do it a few hours and did not work",

          "We went to the Tivoli gardens in the afternoon. We didn't buy the ride ticket, if you have been to adventure parks around the world then this is nothing special. We were there on the last day of summer and we had a music concert, light show and fireworks to mark the occasion.",
          "This is a rather small amusement park with gardens and fountains, but it's mostly restaurants and shops. Pricey. The only restaurant that interested me offered cakes and champagne. Lovely lights and fireworks in the evening. We did not see any musical entertainment except for a",

          "We had an amazing day at Tivoli. It was my daughter's first choice \"attraction\" when in Copenhagen. Lots of rides, plenty of space to walk around. Lots of entertainment and food. I'm so glad we went, because it seemed to have everything you want all rolled into one.",
          "Tivilo Gardens was an enjoyable evening in late August. As retirees, we went to see the gardens while still light. The park comes to life when the lights come on. There are a few rides for all ages but we chose the non-ride admission. In the meantime, enjoy a relaxing meal",

          "I had heard of Tivoli Gardens before, but didn\u2019t know it was an amusement park, so it was not high on my list. Turns out it is a park with rides, beautiful landscape, light shows and food. As I was walking around I googled to learn that much of the inspiration for Disney",

          "Enjoyed our evening at the Tivoli gardens. It is an old world amusement park. Much smaller than any of the six flags with a lot fewer rides. The rides cost extra and the cost of the ride varies. The positive side is that the line wait is very limited. Many restaurants and a",
          "I liked the vibe of the place. I tried the roller coaster, but I didn't chose the virtual reality option. My photo looked hilarious. I actually was too scared. I tried another ride which is like a swing that rotates at a higher altitude than average. It was fun but a bit scary",

          "Even if, like me, you are not 'into' fairground rides then you should still go to Tivoli Gardens. You can buy and entrance ticket that does not include rides. this cost us 130dk each. Once inside, if you change your mind, you can purchase ride ticket options from machines around",

          "Just across he road from our hotel this was an amazing site. Much better to see it by night. We weren\u2019t interested in the rides but enjoyed the sites. Had dinner in the Food Hall which offered a wide variety of food and drink",

          "There are many Tivoli parks but only one that is the best, and this is it. Come for the beauty of the surroundings, the music, the shows, the rides, or just the food. We went a few times. It is inexpensive to enter the garden and rides are separate (worth the pass if you plan",
          "Well worth a visit, especially in the evening when everything is lit up! So pretty! Very lively on a Friday night when there\u2019s live music on. If we had known there were so many bars and restaurants inside we would\u2019ve come earlier and spent more time - would be great to go late",

          "A very nice place to visit but it was very crowded and the rides were very busy. The scenery and peacocks wandering about were lovely. I prefer Lisberg to here.",
          "If you like rides then go as a whole day out! Otherwise it can lose value as with all things in Denmark, it is pricey. I would recommend going late afternoon into the evening so you can appreciate the amazing decorations, lakes and themes, as well as the lights when lit up.",
          "A place for all ages, amusement park, beautiful garden with walkways and excellent restaurants. If you want to eat typical danish food like their open sandwiches, Danish pastries, then you are spoilt for choice. You can spend hours in this place. A good place for family",
          "Everyone recommended this place to us but it turned out to be a total rip off. If you like fake authenticity, then this is the perfect place for you, otherwise please don't bother coming here. Instead, try going to Louisiana Museum, a bit outside of Copenhagen but so much more",

          "Suitable for everyone from small children to elderly people. This place was like nothing I have ever experienced. The entry fee was expensive but it is so worth it. The ticket man was so nice. The gardens are beautiful, we went at sunset late evening and the place looked",
          "As much a garden as an amusement park. The rides are almost incidental. The only one we went on was The Flying Trunk/ Den Flyvende Kuffert -passing scenes from the H. C. Anderson tales on slow moving seat/booths. Spent around 4 hours just walking around. Nice shop: \u201c little",

          "You should keep atleast half a day to experience Tivoli. I would definitely recommend going in the evening, that's when it becomes more magical. Although mainly children would enjoy the amusement park, there's enough for you to do even if you don't take the rides - the boat",
          "Being a Disney freak, I HAD to go to Tivoli to see the place where Walt Disney drew his inspiration of Disneyland. This is one of the quaintest theme parks I have ever been to, and it's one of the oldest in the world! The grounds are superbly manicured; there are lawn chairs",

          "If you familiarise yourself with the history of the place, visiting the park may be even more of a treat. There is a lot of history here! The grounds are lovely. It is such a nostalgic, beautiful, buzzing and inviting place. We spent a couple of hours here. Keep in mind that",

          "The block where Tivoli Gardens is located is not huge. It's relatively quick to get from one side to the other on the sidewalk. The place has managed to squeeze all its attractions, including a nice size grassy amphitheater area, into a small city block. This is an attraction",
          "Yes, Tivoli Gardens long predated Disney--which may help explain why it still is so classy and tasteful. Grounds and buildings are clean and well kept. Lots of places to eat and old-fashioned rides. And if you time it right, music too. Sadly, we went on a Sunday evening in",
          "Loved strolling through the park. Maby options for eating and drinks. Check the schedule for entertainment and when fireworks/light shows are held. Must go at night when all the lights are on. Only down side (for me) is that it appears as though it has turned into place",

          "We bought a day pass and had a wonderful day out at the Tivoli gardens. We even sat on a twin deck chair late afternoon and had a quick nap with the beautiful afternoon sun beaming on us. We went on no rides but walked the gardens, soaked in the atmosphere, watched the rides,",

          "Tivoli Garden was very primitive and uninteresting. Non-european design, prehistoric lighting and abnormally high prices. Starting from the ticket prices. I am very disappointed. I would not advise anyone to visit there, and I will never return there.",

          "Tivoli is lovely if you are there for the restaurants. But the attractions are not so special. There is an old small rollercoaster, one mini for very small children and one very awesome with 2 loops. Then there are some free fall towers (if you are lucky they are not all",

        "wiki": "Christiansborg Palace (Danish: Christiansborg Slot; pronounced [k\u02b0\u0281estj\u00e6ns\u02c8p\u0252\u02c0 \u02c8sl\u028ct]) is a palace and government building on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the seat of the Danish Parliament (Folketinget), the Danish Prime Minister's Office, and the Supreme Court of Denmark. Also, several parts of the palace are used by the Danish monarch, including the Royal Reception Rooms, the Palace Chapel and the Royal Stables.The palace is thus home to the three supreme powers: the executive power, the legislative power, and the judicial power. It is the only building in the world that houses all three of a country's branches of government. The name Christiansborg is thus also frequently used as a metonym for the Danish political system, and colloquially it is often referred to as Rigsborgen ('the castle of the realm') or simply Borgen ('the castle').The present building, the third with this name, is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first castle in 1167. Since the early fifteenth century, the various buildings have served as the base of the central administration; until 1794 as the principal residence of the Danish kings and after 1849 as the seat of parliament.\nThe palace today bears witness to three eras of Danish architecture, as the result of two serious fires. The first fire occurred in 1794 and the second in 1884. The main part of the current palace, finished in 1928, is in the historicist Neo-baroque style. The chapel dates back to 1826 and is in a neoclassical style. The showgrounds were built from 1738-46, in a baroque style.\nChristiansborg Palace is owned by the Danish Government, and is run by the Palaces and Properties Agency. Several parts of the palace are open to the public.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Absalon's Castle ===\n\nThe first castle on the site was Absalon's Castle, built in 1167 by the bishop Absalon. According to the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Bishop Absalon of Roskilde built a castle in 1167 on a small island outside Copenhagen Harbour. The castle was made up by a curtain wall, encircling an enclosed courtyard with several buildings, such as the bishop's palace, a chapel and several minor buildings.\nAt the death of Absalon in 1201, possession of the castle and city of Copenhagen passed to the bishops of Roskilde. A few decades later, however, a bitter feud erupted between crown and church, and for almost two centuries the ownership of the castle and city was contested between kings and bishops. Furthermore, the castle was frequently under attack, for example by Wend pirates and the Hanseatic cities, and during the years 1249 to 1259 it was occupied and plundered.\nIn 1370, King Valdemar IV of Denmark was defeated in a conflict with the Hanseatic League, who ordered the castle to be demolished. They sent 40 stonemasons to demolish the castle stone by stone. The castle had long been a terrible nuisance to the Hanseatic cities' trade in the Sound, and the time had now come to remove it.\n\n\n=== Copenhagen Castle ===\n\nDuring the years after the demolition of Bishop Absalon's castle by the Hansa League in 1369, the ruins on the island were covered with earthworks, on which a new stronghold, Copenhagen Castle, was built. This was completed in the late 14th century. The castle had a curtain wall and was surrounded by a moat and with a large, solid tower as an entrance gate.\nThe castle was still the property of the Bishop of Roskilde until King Eric VII usurped the rights to the castle in 1417. From then on the castle in Copenhagen was occupied by the king. In the middle of the 15th century, the castle became the principal residence of the Danish kings and the centre of government.\nThe castle was rebuilt several times. In the 1720s, Frederick IV entirely rebuilt the castle, but it became so heavy that the walls began to give way and to crack. It became therefore evident to Christian VI, Frederik IV's successor, immediately after his accession to the throne in 1730, that an entirely new castle had to be built.\nThe demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle was commenced in 1731 to make room for the first Christiansborg. The ruins of Absalon's castle and Copenhagen Castle were excavated at the start of the 20th century and can be seen today in the subterranean excavations under the present palace.\n\n\n=== First Christiansborg ===\n\nKing Christian VI commissioned architect Elias David H\u00e4usser to build the first Christiansborg Palace (Danish, Christiansborg Slot), and in 1733 work started on a magnificent baroque palace. By 1738, work on the main palace had progressed so far that it was possible to start on the other buildings included in the total project. The palace included show grounds and chapel. Most of the palace complex was completed in 1745 and was the largest palace in northern Europe at the time.The palace and church were ruined by a fire in 1794, but the showgrounds were saved.\n\n\n=== Second Christiansborg ===\n\nWhile the royal family lived in temporary accommodations at Amalienborg Palace, the master builder of Altona, architect Christian Frederik Hansen, was called to Copenhagen to resurrect the palace. Hansen started building the second Christiansborg in 1803 in a French Empire style. By the time the palace was finished in 1828, King Frederick VI had decided he did not want to live there after all, and he only used the palace for entertainment. King Frederick VII was the only monarch to live in the palace. This was between 1852-1863.\nAfter the introduction of the constitutional monarchy with the Constitution of 1849, the south wing of the palace became the meeting place of the two houses of the first Danish Parliament (the Rigsdagen).\nThe second Christiansborg burned down in 1884. Saved were the showgrounds and Hansen's chapel. The ruins remained in place for the following 23 years due to political fighting.\n\n\n=== Third Christiansborg ===\n\nThorvald J\u00f8rgensen won an architecture competition to decide who would design the third (and current) Christiansborg, which was built from 1907-1928. The palace was to contain premises for the royal family, the legislature and the judiciary, and was built in Neo-baroque style in reinforced concrete with granite-covered facades. Fragments from C.F. Hansen's palace were preserved in the north facade facing Prince George's Yard (Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd). The original roof was tiled, but after a national collection, the tiles were replaced with copper in 1937-1938. A weather vane with two crowns was later added to the tower, and at 106 meters became the tallest tower in the city.\nDuring the digging work, they came across the ruins of Absalon's Castle and Copenhagen Castle. It was decided to make them publicly accessible, and the ruins under the current palace, and the historical exhibition opened to the public in 1924.\n\n\n== Christiansborg Palace today ==\n\nThe palace is roughly divided in the middle, with the Parliament located in the southern wing and the Royal Reception Rooms, the Supreme Court and the Prime Minister's Office in the northern wing.\nSeveral parts of the palace are open to the public after published schedule with guided tours available, for a substantial fee. It is centrally located in Copenhagen's Indre By (\"City Center\") district.\n\n\n=== Royal Reception Rooms ===\nThe Royal Reception Rooms at Christiansborg Palace are located on the ground floor and first floor in the northern half of the palace. The Rooms are used for official functions of the monarch such as banquets, state dinners, the New Year's lev\u00e9e, diplomatic accreditations, audiences and meetings of the council of state.\nThe Reception Rooms are richly adorned with furniture and works of art rescued from the two earlier palaces, as well as decorations by some of the best Danish artists, such as Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Laurits Tuxen, Joakim Skovgaard and Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard.\nTo reach the Royal Reception Rooms one goes through the Queen's Gate (Dronningeporten), and through the Hall of the Halberdiers (Drabantsalen) to the King's Stairway (Kongetrappen). At the foot of the stairs are the Audience Chamber (Audiensgemakket) and the State Council Room (Statsr\u00e5dssalen). The Queen holds an audience every other Monday and attends Council with the government as required \u2013 usually on Wednesdays. The Queen in Council signs new Acts after their adoption in Parliament. The Audience Chamber and the State Council Room are the only Royal Reception Rooms that are closed to the public.\nThe King's Stairway gives access to the Tower Hall (T\u00e5rnsalen). The Tower Hall displays a series of tapestries with motifs from Danish folk songs, woven after cartoons painted by Joakim Skovgaard.\n\nFacing the Palace Square is the oval Throne Room (Tronsalen) where foreign ambassadors present their credentials to Queen Margrethe II. The Throne Room gives access to the balcony where the Danish monarchs are proclaimed. The Throne Room is decorated with a large ceiling painting by Kr\u00e6sten Iversen, depicting how the Danish flag, Dannebrog, fell from the sky in Estonia in 1219.\nThe Royal Reception Rooms also include the Fredensborg Hall (Fredensborgsalen), with Laurits Tuxen's painting of King Christian IX and his whole family together at Fredensborg Palace, and parts of the Queen's Library.\nThe Great Hall is the largest and most spectacular of the Royal Reception Rooms. The Hall is 40 metres long with a ceiling height of 10 metres, and a gallery runs all the way around the room. The Hall seats 400 guests and is used for banquets, state dinners and receptions.\nThe Great Hall was renovated on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 60th birthday when artist Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard's 17 tapestries recounting the history of Denmark were hung on the walls. The tapestries were a gift from the Danish business community on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 50th birthday.\nThe Alexander Hall (Alexandersalen) is named for Bertel Thorvaldsen's marble frieze \"Alexander the Great Enters Babylon\". The frieze was made for the second Christiansborg Palace, and parts of it survived the fire. It was later restored and mounted in this room. The Hall is used for smaller receptions and official dinners, often in connection with state visits.\n\n\n=== Parliament Wing ===\n\nThe first floor of the Parliament Wing is structured around the Lobby. At both ends of Lobby are the chambers of Rigsdagen, the former bicameral parliament; the Folketing chamber is located at the far end and the Landsting located at the other (the far chamber has been the only one in use since the Folketing became the sole legislative assembly in 1953). Along the hall are various rooms such as the Speaker's office and offices for the administration.\n\n\n=== Ruins under the palace ===\nUnder the present palace lie the ruins of Bishop Absalon's Castle and Copenhagen Castle. When the foundations of the present Christiansborg Palace were being cast, workers came across ruins of several buildings and parts of a curtain wall.\nExperts were called in from the National Museum of Denmark and the ruins, which lay beneath the inner palace yard, were unearthed. Public interest in these ruins, which dated back to around the year 1167, was tremendous. It was therefore decided that the ruins should not be covered over again but preserved for posterity. The reinforced concrete structure erected to cover the ruins was the biggest of its kind in Denmark when it was built in 1908.\nThe ruins beneath the palace square were excavated in 1917 and a cover was also built over them. The ruins have been open to the public since 1924. The Ruins Exhibition was renovated during the period 1974-77 and has remained more or less untouched since then.\n\n\n=== The Palace Chapel ===\n\nChristiansborg Palace Chapel is a part of the palace which is at the disposal of the Danish Monarch. It is used for religious ceremonies for members of the Danish Royal Family, most notably baptisms, confirmations and official lying in state. It is also used by the Danish Parliament for the Church service in connection with the opening of parliament.\nThe history of Christiansborg Palace Chapel goes back to the first Christiansborg Palace, which was built by the contractor general Elias David H\u00e4usser from 1733-45. King Christian VI was keen on architecture, and he commissioned a talented young architect in the King's building service, Nicolai Eigtved, to design the palace chapel (1738\u201342). Eigtved seized the opportunity and designed one of the most distinguished Rococo interiors in Denmark.\nIn 1794 fire ravaged the palace and it was decided to demolish the ruins completely. The demolition, however, never took place.\nArchitect Christian Frederik Hansen, who resurrected the palace between 1803\u20131828, was also commissioned to rebuild the palace chapel in 1810. Work commenced in 1813, using the existing foundations and masonry as far as possible. The church and main palace were built in strict neo-classical style, with a dome construction on top of a central church interior. The palace chapel was inaugurated on Whit Sunday, 14 May 1826, to mark the 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of Christianity to Denmark.\nThe second palace fire in 1884 spared the church, as the fire was stopped in the buildings linking it to the palace. However, fate finally caught up with the church on 7 June 1992. The church burned to the ground, probably set ablaze by fireworks set off during the Whitsun carnival.\nDuring the 1992 church fire, the roof, dome and dividing floor were burned down and the inventory severely damaged. Shortly afterwards, the Danish Ministry of Finance's Palaces and Properties Agency began rebuilding the chapel in collaboration with Erik M\u00f8ller's Drawing Studio A/S and Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Jens Fredslund. No drawings existed of the dome and roof, but a systematic exercise in building archaeology registered the charred remains of the building, and made it possible to recreate the dome and roof. Historically accurate building methods were also used throughout the rebuilding process.\nDanish craftsmen were unable to undertake the difficult work of restoring and recreating the interior's scagliola. One of Germany's leading experts, Manfred Siller, took charge and taught the venerable technique to Danish stucco workers.\nThe rebuilt church was inaugurated on 14 January 1997 to celebrate Queen Margrethe II's Silver Jubilee. The rebuilding was awarded the prestigious Europa Nostra prize.\n\n\n=== Riding Ground Complex ===\nThe Show Grounds are now all that remain of the first Christiansborg Palace. They consist of two symmetrical wings with a straight, low and narrow stable building followed by a high broad building and narrow, curved stables, after which a one-story narrow end building closes off the wings at the Frederiksholm Canal end.\nIn 1742, the north wing became the first one to be finished. Building work on the south wing started in June 1740 but ground to a halt by the autumn due to difficulties in obtaining supplies. Work did not recommence until January 1744, now under the supervision of the young architect Nicolai Eigtved. Eigtved's superior artistic insight meant it turned out more beautiful than the north wing. In 1746, 87 hunting horses and 165 carriage horses moved into the new stables, the largest number ever.\nIn 1766-67, the architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin built a court theatre on the floor above the big stables. It now houses the Theatre Museum.\nThe Royal Stables are home to the horses and carriages used to perform the ceremonial transport for the Danish Royal Family during state events and festive occasions. In 1789 the number of horses reached a peak with 270 horses stabled. Today, there are about 20 horses left, and some parts of the original stable buildings have been converted into offices and garages.From 2007 to 2009 the Royal Stables underwent a thorough renovation to meet the requirements of current animal welfare law.\n\nA Riding School is located in the northern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Court Theatre. The Riding School is used for horse shows and to exercise the horses of the Royal Stables. On occasion it is also used for various cultural events such as opera or theatre performances.\nThe interior is more or less unchanged since the construction in the 1740s. It is equipped with a balcony and a royal box to allow audiences the possibility to attend exercises and performances. The royal box is unique as it is the only royal room preserved from the first palace.\n\n\n==== The Court Theatre ====\n\nThe Court Theatre is located over the stables in the southern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Riding School. Since 1922 the Court Theatre has housed the collection of the Theatre Museum. The auditorium is often used for theatre performances, lectures and television programmes.\nAlready at the Copenhagen Castle, one of the wings was fitted out as a theatre. However, the first Christiansborg Palace was constructed without a theatre. During the early reign of King Christian VII it became customary to have theatre performances in the Banqueting Hall, and in 1766 it was decided to construct a proper court theatre. A harness storeroom was adapted to an auditorium. The theatre was designed by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin and inaugurated by King Christian VII and Queen Caroline Matilda in January 1767. Little remains of this original theatre as it was reconstructed in 1842 following the designs of architect J\u00f8rgen Hansen Koch. In time the Court Theatre came to function as an annex to the Royal Danish Theatre. In 1881 the theatre was closed as performance venue following the tragic fire of the Ringtheater in Vienna which underlined the dangers involved in the continued use of old theatres.\n\n\n=== The Tower ===\nIn June 2014, a viewing platform in the Tower, still the tallest in the city, was made accessible to the public, while the interior of the Tower was refurbished and a restaurant opened in place of what was once a storage room. Access to the viewing platform is free, though passing through a security check is required due to the official nature of the building. There is the comfortable elevator.\n\n\n==== The View ====\nThe View, an observation deck of the Tower, gives an opportunity to enjoy the views of the following buildings:\n\n\n=== Other features ===\n\n\n==== The Marble Bridge and the pavilions ====\n\nIn H\u00e4usser's original project from the first Christiansborg, the two wings of the palace were linked by a gatehouse at the Frederiksholm Canal end, and a drawbridge led over the canal. The Palace Building Commission was not completely satisfied with the proposal and asked two young architects working for the royal building authority, Nicolai Eigtved and Lauritz de Thurah, to come up with an alternative suggestion.\nTheir proposal included a permanent bridge over Frederiksholm Canal forming the main entrance to the palace and two portal pavilions flanking an open drive and closing the complex off between the two wings. Both bridge and pavilions were in the new rococo style.\nResponsibility was transferred to Eigtved, who was the prime mover behind the project.\nThe bridge was extremely elegant\u2014 sandstone covered with medallion decorations by the sculptor Louis August le Clerc. The pavements were paved with Norwegian marble, hence the name the Marble Bridge (Marmorbro), and the roadway paved with cobblestones.\nThe pavilions were every bit as magnificent as the bridge. They were covered with sandstone from Saxony, and the sculptor Johan Christof Petzoldt richly decorated the concave roofs with the royal couple's back-to-back monograms and four figures on each roof symbolising the royal couple's positive traits. The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason Jacob Fortling. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.\nIn 1996, when Copenhagen was European Capital of Culture, the Palaces and Properties Agency finished a restoration of the Showgrounds that had taken many years. The Marble Bridge and Pavilions were restored between 1978 and 1996 by architect Erik Hansen and the Show Grounds from 1985-1996 by Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Gehrdt Bornebusch.\n\n\n==== King Christian IX's equestrian statue ====\nA collection was started for the construction of a monument to King Christian IX shortly after his death in 1906. The following year four artists were invited to compete for the commission. There was no discussion about the position of the statue. It would be erected on Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex as a pendant to the statue of King Frederick VII on the Palace Square.\nSculptor Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, the wife of composer Carl Nielsen, won the competition with her proposal for a new equestrian statue. In the proposal, the statue was shown on a high pedestal, on the sides of which were reliefs depicting a procession of the leading men of the day, including industrialist Carl Frederik Tietgen, politician Jakob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup and poets Jens Peter Jacobsen and Holger Drachmann. The reliefs were later axed, and the architect Andreas Clemmensen designed the pedestal that bears the horse today.\nThe sculptor sought throughout the country for the right horse to stand as a model, but found it in Hanover in Germany. This gave rise to a good deal of displeasure among Danish horse breeders.\nThe monument took a long time to complete, but in 1927, 21 years after the king's death, it was unveiled on the Riding Ground Complex.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nThis article incorporates text from the homepage of SES, the official Danish caretaker for state-owned buildings.\n\n\n== External links ==\nChristiansborg Palace\nFolketinget (Parliament)\nThe Prime Minister's Office\nThe Monarchy\nThe Royal Stables\nThe Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre\nVisiting Copenhagen (AOK)\nCopenhagen-Portal \u2013 Christiansborg Castle \u2013 The Danish Parliament\nT\u00e5rnet (The Tower)",

          "This was a great experience seeing how the banquest were prepared back in the day. The kitchen has not been used in a long time, but everything is there, the copper utensils, the ovens, and a great video on how they do things today. well worth a visit.",
          "Look up in the palace the ceilings are beautiful. Lots of paintings and plaster work above your head. Got to see the stables and see the horses. Watch the video in the stable. Don't miss the gardens they are beautiful too",
          "I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t take my handicapped Mom with me, as the cobblestone streets would\u2019ve been difficult for her and the slot castle was dimly lit and I didn\u2019t see hand rails on the stairs. That being said, the furnishings were gorgeous, fantastic paintings, and interesting",
          "The garden and reception rooms were gorgeous! We really enjoyed the tapestries. The Queen hosts a New Year\u2019s party at this property every year. It also houses the Danish Parliament and Archives. The stables were not open so unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to see the royal horses.",
          "I didn't know the admission was already included in my Copenhagen Card. So I pretty much paid double for the same attraction... It's a nice place to visit, especially the state rooms. But the signs and maps were not very clear for people to get around. Also this ticket doesn't",

          "We didn't go inside the palace, but we did go up the tower as one of the first things we did in Copenhagen. It was great to be able to get an overview of the City before deciding what we would do next. We got to the tower around 2pm and the line to get up the tower took about",
          "At 160 DKK, entance isn't the cheapest for the combined ticket, but if you were visiting one palace in Copenhagen, this would probably be it. We visited the Royal Reception Rooms and the Ruins. Both were interesting and explained the history and formation of Copenhagen right",
          "The trip is worth the great hall tapestries. They are wonderful and took 10 years to make with 60 workers. Very bright, not like most European ancient tapestries.",
          "Beautiful well kept building. Beautiful gardens, well worth the visit, we did not visit inside, but will next time",
          "Hard to find entrance but lovely when we found it. Only did the Tapestries and Royal Reception tour. The Great Hall has uncharacteristic tapestries hanging on walls - not to be missed! Find the accompanying \u201cinformation cards\u201d for details on their content.",
          "Was nice but probably would have rated higher if this was the first palace I visited on my trip. Only one tour a day is offered in English which is too bad because the guides really make the experience much better. Suggest you plan around the free tour. The tour app was hard",
          "Very nice historical building, come here with family. Using Hop On Hop Off sightseeing bus.. city : Copenhagen",
          "This is one of the key sites in town, and certainly worth a wak through. Try as I might, I can't think of much more to say...although I should add that we had hired a guide and his explanation of the area's history made the visit more interesting than just a walk.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this large Royal Palace. The Royal reception rooms were magnificent, especially the huge vivid tapestries in some of the larger rooms. I also was impressed by the library and also ruins of the previous palaces, preserved and able to be viewed in",
          "We arrived at 4pm so only had 1 hour. We had been walking all day so it was a bit of a last minute decision. We didn't regret it one bit. Had the place to ourselves. Beautiful rooms. Understated, elegant and fascinating as they are still used. One of our highlights from",
          "You should definitely visit the Reception Rooms at the Christiansborg Palace - the highlight being the Queen's Reference Library and the Great Hall with some stunning tapestries. If you get a chance definitely visit The Tower to get a panoramic view of the city and the best",
          "The palace is now a tourist attraction and is used for government official functions. It is majestic and well preserved, though nobody lives there any more. We had only a very quick tour of the place because of time limitations. There are many paintings and art work",
          "The first building on this site was built in 1157 and was rebuilt several times in different configurations due to fires. It is a beautiful palace that is now used by the government but much of it is open to the public. If you are going to be in Copenhagen, this is a must see.",
          "Having seen many of the great palaces in Europe, Christiansborg was much more understated and useable. Magnificent tapestries.",
          "I biked the entire city and I found it incredibly convenient to travel to the palace. Copenhagen is the pinnacle city for a biker. There was a bike stand near the entrance and I was set. I went to the highest point in Oslo, Stockholm, and Copenhagen and this was by far the most",
          "Absolutely excellent! The fee is well worth it and allows entry to the main buildings including stables, kitchen, ruins, main Palace. We down loaded the app and this was helpfully illustrated on a guide sheet, which provided a running commentary room by room. It was immaculately",
          "Frankly, the little storeroom you pass through on the way up the tower is the most interesting part. Some models and plaster casts for planned sculptures that never got made. From the top you can verify that Copenhagen is dreary as far as the eye can see. Free admission",
          "Christiansborg is a must if you are in Copenhagen. There is a palace section, kitchen, and stables and ruins. We did the first three. Palace has rooms very well decorated with different colors. The best part is the tapestry room. There are twelve bright colored tapestries",
          "Not as ornate as Buckingam Palace, but more interesting. Definitely worth doing the ruins, kitchen and stables as well. The view from the tower is excellent.",
          "The palace was beautiful. You don't see a ton of rooms - but for 160 dk you have access to the (small) kitchen, the stables with carriages, and then also the underground excavations of the former castles on that site. This was the nicest castle I saw within the city. I took",
          "The place is worth a visit but we were expecting something more...only few parts of the palace are accessible to visitors and we expected a bigger collection of arts to be seen.",
          "Photogenic castle and grounds. Didn't do an interior tour, but the surrounding grounds and castle were beautiful. Loved the polished round granite boulders across the front!",
          "During our first stay in Copenhagen, we had only had the opportunity to view the Christiansborg Slot from the outside. Our most recent stay in the city saw us better prepared for visiting attractions by purchasing Copenhagen Cards online before we travelled. Consequently, this",
          "We bought the combi ticket which gets you access to the palace rooms, the ruins, the kitchens and the stables. I would recomend this if you have time as we found the ruins, which are under the existing palace and courtyard, to be a really interesting display of hundreds of years",
          "Me and my Husband bought a Copenhagen pass and this included access to 4 sections. We only got to see 3 sections as we got there in the afternoon. We liked looking at the kitchens with all the copper ware. The royal stables were just showing the carts as for 2 months every year",
          "We just walked around this area but did not go inside. However, it was very impressive from outside (better than Rosenborg castle)",
          "This was our favorite Palace In Copenhagen. You have to leave your bags in a locker and put shoe covers on your shoe's but then you walk around the palace on your own. This place has so many beautiful room's to see and when we went there it was not many people .It was really",
          "We visited Christiansborg slot and got a combo ticket which included entry to the royal reception rooms, the kitchen, the stables and the ruins. The reception rooms were very impressive and worth seeing. Unfortunately the horses are not in the stables over the summer period so",
          "Be prepared to put on the blue plastic over shoes to protect the floors of the magnificent palace. There are seats provided to do this. If you intend to go in. It is best to put your rucksack or any large bag in the free lockers provided. You will be given a key. The palace is",
          "The castle, og palace has been rebuilt several times, and the current one has neven been a royal residence, but is used by parliment, ministers and the royal family for many occations. The tours may wary as the palace is in use. Amazing tapestries (I liked the older ones best)",
          "The horses were on holiday when we visited so the stables lacked something!! albeit the historic carriages were interesting. However the Royal Reception Rooms were excellent, true regal elegance. The information boards brought to live the personality of the Royal Family.",
          "You can run through the different areas quickly or you can take your time going through. Each section is interesting in its own right. It is quite a lovely place to see.",
          "We bought the combination ticket which grants you access to many places within the Castle's ground. At the time of our visit though, three things were not available: - The Tower (closed until end of August '19) - The horses were on a retreat for the Summer - The parliament",
          "Christiansborg Palace is beautiful. Very historical and educational. Very well preserved. Very pleasant to walk through.",
          "Large bags are not permitted in the palace reception rooms. There are lockers next to the shop to store your bags. You do NOT need any money to put into the lockers. Some of the keys can be tricky to get out. Be patient, they will come out. You have to put blue covers into",
          "Make sure you buy a combined ticket or use your Copenhagen Card, schedule the visit in order to visit the Royal Stables that open at 13 30 to 4pm. Strongly suggested to add the theatre that is not part of the combi ticket but you canaccess for free with CC. Bear in mind that",
          "Good to see where the king once lived. Love the architecture in Denmark. Liked how the king created different things.",
          "From what I could understand only two small areas are open to the public. I saw everything in maybe 35 minutes. I think that the larger parts of the palace are open on other days and there is a guided tour available but not at the time I was visiting. Personally I wouldn't",
          "We did all three tours here; the Royal Reception Halls, the Ruins, and the Kitchen. The Royal Reception Halls were just gorgeous, with each room explained with small signs in Danish and English. The Greal Hall was especially impressive, matched only by the regal nature of the",
          "Our Combi ticket gave us an included guided tour of the Reception rooms, kitchen, stables and Chapel. The guide was excellent, we got a lot of information well delivered. For the price, good value as we could still go around after the tour.",
          "The palace is nice. There is also a free entry to the tower, but due to renivation the tower is closed until the end of the august 2019.",
          "I had all 4 combination tickets. The kitchen was ok but the rests pf area were pretty cool. The castle was twice burned down, still able to see gorgeous royal life close by.",
          "Christiansborg has something for everyone. The tour lets you see many areas of the castle including kitchen, stables, main rooms. There is also the area under ground where they have preserved the original foundations and explain the history of the building.",
          "Its very special to be able to see the house of the royalties up close. This is what you get here, you can stand in the middle and watch where the queen stays and the coming King. Its very quick to get the overview of this place but its still worth visiting as I believe its",
          "Beautiful parliament with big grounds. We did not get to go inside but was facinating from outside. Well maintained.",
          "This is where Danish Parliament sits. Nice building to look around. Lots of history. Stables at the back are open to the public. At the tower, you can go up free of charge and see great views of Copenhagen. You have to go through security and there are two lifts you have to",
          "The state rooms were beautiful and full of history. We brought the comb-ticket which foes make it all cheaper, the ruins were interesting too, the rest was nothing you haven't seen at other castles and palaces.",
          "The palace, stables, kitchen and Parliament all were great views into Danish life and history, Get the combo ticket or a CPH Card for value and see them all.",
          "Wow. What an insight into the royal family history especially the kitchen. A step back in time with great video and information to show how things were done. Very impressive Palace with a surprising lack of security everywhere. What a trusting population, and what a great thing.",
          "Short, average, just Okay. We did not learn much from this place nor we thought it was worth the time. If you have the Copenhagen card and time, then okay.",
          "Loved the tour round the main rooms... so bright and airy. Lots of history associated with this castle. Has a royal kitchen, stables & ruins that you can also visit.",
          "We bought the multi ticket and unfortunately we missed the royal rooms because the Queen was there that day. But, the underground ruins were fantastic and a great way to learn about the history of historical Copenhagen.",
          "Very much enjoyed exploring this castle. They have guided tours of different parts of the castle throughout the day, but we opted just to explore on our own. A must-see in Copwnhagen!",
          "This is a beautiful palace. .Rooms are beautifully decorated and there is so much you can see here. .",
          "So much to see and experience. We rode the hop on hop off bus and did the river cruise included. Everything was so expensive.",
          "Well worth a stop on a city walking tour. Grand with striking interior. The kitchens are worth a visit too.",
          "this is a vuge palace of a Danish Queen although she does not live here.Display of many things related to history,paintings,statues,ruins are worth seeing.Its spaceous and easily walk around.Its a great experience and must see attraction",
          "Several things to be seen here :ruins, tower, rooms, stables, kitchen and church. We particularly enjoyed the ruins as they provide a history lesson as well about the palace. The stables were boring without the horses.",
          "do this is you have the copenhagen card - otherwise it is not worth it. you are allowed into the kitchens, the stables and the ruins and the reception rooms - they charge individually for them so unless you have the card don't.",
          "We enjoyed our visit and loved how open and free you could move around. We wish we had been a little better prepared as we wanted to tour some areas that were prearranged tours and we couldn\u2019t go.",
          "The Royal Reception Rooms are so beautiful. Try your best to get the English tour. The guide explains each room along with some Danish history (1 hour long tour).",
          "A must when in Copenhagen. There are many different areas of this palace that can be visited such as the ruins, the horse stables, the kitchen, etc\u2026 The Christiansborg Palace tower is also another place to be seen.",
          "Different areas of the palace can be visited - the ruins, the horse stables, the kitchen and the palace. All are worth a visit but the palace is probably the most interesting particularly due to the wonderful modern tapesteries in the main hall.",
          "It was part of our free walking tour so we had a lot to see and hear from our guide. I reccomend it.",
          "We were walking around Christiansborg Palace at the end of the day and waned to see if there was something we could quickly do, particularly something free. It turned out there was: the tower. The Christiansborg Palace tower is free and offers very nice panoramic views of",
          "Nice views with few stairs to climb! The viewing platform in the tower is accessed by two separate elevators and then a small number of stairs. So, there is not much effort to see some nice views of Copenhagen in all four directions. Admission fee was very reasonable. For even",
          "The view from the top of the tower is good and entrance was free, you just need to wait in line - 40 people at a time.",
          "The palaces were a fantastic sight. You could see the horses around also and the garrison was also nearby.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting the palace--its nicely done without being over the top. The Great Hall is really a must see. Even though it was a Saturday, there weren't too many people in the castle which was nice.",
          "Probably a highlight of our visit to Copenhagen- wonderful building and ornate throughout. Building was truly beautiful. The artwork and chandeliers were huge.",
          "We used our Copenhagen Card to get access to the ruins of original buildings; the royal reception rooms; the stables; the kitchen and the tower. As access was 'free' - I would recommend seeing them all and do stop to watch the video in the ruins about the history of the",
          "While we were here we were lucky as it was like a beehive as the elections had only been done the day before. We saw the changing of the guards and also both flags were flying showing the royals were there. Lovely warm day and it really is a beautiful area. Take your time to",
          "Large area, worth watching for the changing of the guard. The Royal family were not present as the flag was not flying when we visited. Large area to walk around. Cars do pass through so take heed when taking photos.",
          "Christianborg Slot is kept in pristine condition and is hugely rewarding for a history buff. The prolific original art collection took my breath away.",
          "Worth seeing if historical castles are your thing. The four areas are all included within the Copenhagen card. 1. Definitely visit the Reception Rooms. Plenty to see with plenty of grandeur. This takes the most time, maybe over an hour, more if stopping to really view",
          "The tower is free to enter, one of the highest viewing point in Copenhagen with amazing views of thr city. This is a must go place in Copenhagen. They only allow 40 people max at a time.",
          "We decided to only visit the royal reception rooms, and are glad we did. The rooms are mostly empty but there are quite a few of them. You can definitely see how rich the monarch\u2019s image is. The art and architecture are gorgeous. Definitely a must see!",
          "This castle is near the National Museum in downtown Copenhagen. It is about a five minute walk. Its a huge complex. There are multiple museums to explore andenjoy. You can go to the top of the tower for free. However you must pass through airport stylye",
          "This includes the Royal Kitchens, reception rooms, ruins, stables and the tower (only the last being free - the others we used a Copenhagen Card but they also had deals on tickets - children free to all) Of the three palaces we visited this had the most to see. The kitchens are",
          "One of many castles that are available to visit while you are in Copenhagen. So much interesting history. Well worth the time.",
          "The main palace with the royal state rooms is open every day, and it is truly regal. Side attractions - the royal kitchen, the royal stables, and the underground ruins - are only open for tours on Saturday. But a visit to the royal state rooms is the main reason for going.",
          "Beautiful palace! We wandered around the place for a long time looking at all the stables and other parts. There are plenty of places to take pictures and stop and rest. The restaurant looked lovely but we didn't have time to go in.",
          "We only had 30 minutes to walk around the palace, and we were devastated because it was beautiful and we wished we could stay for hours. It was very confusing to find where to go because there are 5 separate sections to have a look at, only the tower is well sign posted. Great",
          "I greatly enjoyed the ruins underneath the palace. The actual palace itself was also amazing. The stables have a few royal carriages in them but it is a working stable and so you get a good whiff of fresh horse manure and that is not my idea of fun. I honestly don't know what",
          "Take the combo ticket and enjoy all! Amazing rooms that are used still in official functions. We went in the morning some time after it was opend, saw horses training at the yard and there was no-one touring the palace! We had it for our selfs, how cool!",
          "Impressive building from all sides. Stroll around and definitely go visit the tower for free. It's the highest point to enjoy a beautiful view over the city. You can go with an elevator to the top, only last part it's a short stairway to the deck. Must do!",
          "The royal reception rooms are still used by the Queen for engagements and events. They are truly gorgeous. You get a sense that she loves colour and vibrancy in textiles - see the room with the Queen's tapestries. Also the library is a beautiful room.",
          "This is a short walk from #1 stop on the hop on hop off bus. Beautiful reception rooms at the palace, there is also a tour of palace kitchens and the ruins. The elevator ride to the top of tower is also worth a visit.",
          "As for me Christiansborg was the most interesting castle in Copenhagen if you compare with Rosenborg and Amalienborg. Exept castle we also have visited Royal Kitchen, The Ruins and Royal Stables. Christiansborg this is the place where the Queen holds official events, so it does",
          "Here we saw the Royal Reception Rooms, The Royal Kitchen, The Royal Stables and the Ruins. The reception rooms were beautuful and the stables had beautiful old coaches and a few very friendly white horses you can say hello to. The kitchen was quite big and had lots of shiney",
          "We visited this museum again just to see the beautiful tapestries on display. There are lovely rooms to see and you are provided with a map and information. It is a charming and beautiful palace but all this is insignificant when compared to the beauty, work and detail of the",
          "There are tons of castles in Europe and every one of them has its charm; Christiansborg isn't the exception and I would go as far as saying it's one of the best. Its large grounds and clean spaces give out a beautiful regal vibe that it's hard to beat. It is still used by",
          "I am not much of a castle person, but I thought I would check it out. With the booties they make you wear, it was very \"museum\" like.. As the monarch still uses this castle, I can see why it is kept the way it is kept. I wasn't overly thrilled with it but I still enjoyed my",
          "We visited here early afternoon and the lines were short. We spent most time in the tower. The views across the city were stunning, right over to the Oresund bridge, and Malmo. The lift was fast, and the staff helpful. The grounds and buildings are stunning but we did not",
          "A number of exhibits available for the entrance price including some royal apartments. These were interesting especially the huge reception hall hung with fascinating tapestries. I found the preserved ruins under the castle the most interesting with lots of information about",
          "We wandered round the buildings and courtyard and admired its splendour. The guide on the boat tour told us we could go up the tower for free but we were getting to the end of a long day and didn\u2019t want to queue.",
          "There are numerous things to see here, including the royal apartments, the stables and the tower, which afford a panoramic view over the city, and the ruins beneath. Allow yourself 2-3 hours to see it all. It is possible to wander around alone,",
          "We had the benefit of a Danish friend to tell us the history of the site- first as the residence of the King of Denmark, and now home to the Danish Parliament. The whole area is quite photogenic and walkable.",
          "You not only can visit the palace but also the tower where you can get good views of the city, the chapel where the royalties have baptisms, funerals, etc..The royal kitchen is also quite interesting and I din have time to visit the stables though..",
          "This was one of the most amazing castles i was in during my trip - stunning! We didn\u2019t get into the stables since they closed at 4, but the rest of the castle was amazing! A must see!",
          "We had purchased the Copenhagen Card, which means we could visit this palace (amongst other things) for free. It would also have been worth paying for! You can visit a large part of the castle (including a ball room, the throne room, a beautiful library, the old kitchens and",
          "This was one of the best palace or castle tours we have done. It took about 2-3 hours, and not only gives you a great understanding of the palace, but about the evolution of Copenhagen the city itself.",
          "This is one of the top palace tours. There are so many aspects and it still feels lived in for the most parts. Exquisite detail and luxury in the most humble manner. Took too long for the round tower so skipped that after waiting for half an hour.",
          "With a morning to spare, we thought we would try it. We bought the combined ticket, but then only managed the kitchen and Royal Rooms, so it proved poor value. I loved the kitchen. There was a video explaining one particular event, which was fascinating. Particularly how they",
          "Came here to view the castle and arrived when there was a free tour starting. Our guide was fabulous. He had a great knowledge of the castle both in the past and the present day. He answered everyone\u2019s questions very well and really made us enjoy the visit more as we got a",
          "We visited the palace rooms. Wow wow wow. Stunning. Some of the most beautiful decorated rooms i have ever seen. A place full of history and prestige. Awesome.",
          "This Palace is great! Situated in the centre of Copenhagen, the architecture is stunning and the paintings and tapestries are wonderful.",
          "Visited this beautiful palace as we are into historic places, the reception rooms of the palace where beautiful and the ceilings had amazing drawings on and the architecture on the walls where truly amazing and beautiful. Also visited the ruins under the palace, kitchen and the",
          "The Palace is also where Parliament is located. We toured the Royal Reception Rooms without an audio guide because we had personal guides. The rooms are beautiful and it was nice to be able walk around. The tapestry in the Great Hall was modern and amazing. We were free to take",
          "First, this is not one museum but five in one location. You get free entry to all 5 with the Copenhagen Card and you don't have to do them all at the same time. We did the ruins first and then the kitchens followed by the reception rooms. This place is reflective of royalty as",
          "Christiansborg Palace, rebuilt several times, and in the current Neo-baroque style in 1928. It houses the country's parliament, supreme court, and prime minister's office.",
          "We spent a few hours out of the cold visiting the royal reception rooms. If you take the time to read the cards, there are some interesting royal stories to read. There's a colourful opulance to be expected of a royal residence, even if it's not to my working class taste ;o)",
          "We used our Copenhagen cards to get in, amazing tour of the palace but the best bit for me was the tapestry room. I could have spent hours looking at all the hangings and reading about them all. Well worth the visit if your into history.",
          "We only visited the reception rooms, which are gourgeous, but they are just empty rooms.They could use some decoration, information and objects. We didn't have time, but you can also visit the ruins, stables, tower and more. I didn't know about the Copenhagen Card, but I'd",
          "Visited as part of the walking tour of the city. Amazing that you can walk right up to where the Danish Royal family live and even see the out walking..\"",
          "very nice area, the guards were unusual and we saw them change positions, very short walk through a scenic area to see the little mermaid from there.",
          "Beautiful building right in the centre of Copenhagen, easy walk to palace. Self tour able to be undertaken or you can have guide.",
          "Amazing visit of the palace, interiors. Great contemporary pictures of the royal family and meetings, as well as paintings and sculptures from old times. Definitely a must-go!",
          "It was nice and there are not many tourist on a workday in the second half of January. First I visited the tower (it is free), then I bought a ticket for all the four public parts. The guided tour lasted about 55 minutes (45 in theory). It is nice that one can visit the parts on",
          "This was very interesting as the palace has been built several times due to various fires in its history. The rooms are lovely and the tapestries fantastic. You can visit the stables, the kitchens, the palace and the ruins below the foundations (all on the Copenhagen city",
          "Nice palace to have a wander around, included in the Copenhagen card. There is a lot to see around the castle and grounds so take plenty of time.",
          "I walked around the Palace on my way to Nyhavn. Unfortunately I didn't have much time as I would have liked to explore it properly. It is a lovely size and well signposted. I hope to be able to go back and in particular climb the tower for the view.",
          "A very intimate visit of a palace. The palace was among the most brightly lit of any I have visited by both the large windows and the chandeliers. The rooms are absolutely amazing and the tapestries in the main hall covering Danish history are extraordinary. I visited during the",
          "Even the guards don't smile as they don't don't most places you see around the world. Absolutely beautiful buildings, with a great water view of the Opera. Very magnificent!",
          "We was not only blown away by the beautiful architecture, but by how you could walk the grounds freely without feeling like you shouldn't be there. There was horses training when we walked through that area which our children really enjoyed. (Especially as they had a wonderful",

          "Its a substantial palace. My sister and I walked with the queens guards for the changing of the guard. This was a fun experience. They leave the Rosenburg Castle at 11:30 & make their way to the Palce for 12. Well worth a watch.",
          "This is one of many buildings near the centre of Copenhagen that are well worth a visit - the architecture is outstanding.",
          "We stubbled upon this by chance. We're glad we did. Saw the guards and the beautiful palace. Very well maintained. Nice walk.",
          "I have visited the palace on my city break in CPH, quite an interesting museum. I recommend to book the ticket in advance (online) to avoid the queue. Check both the tower and the horses.",
          "It is worth a visit to see the Palace. Although we did not take a tour, we were able to walk around the grounds and see the building from outside.",
          "The castle is massive, an impressive building given its size and architectural details. Unfortunately, we could visit only the outdoors as we visited the place on January 2nd and almost all touristic attractions were closed to visitors.",
          "My wife and I weren't sure about visiting Christiansborg Palace but are glad we did. We opted for the triple ticket: Christiansborg Palace, Royal Kitchen and the Ruins under the Palace. The ruins were fascinating and took a little over an hour. You could easily do it quicker",
          "Located on a lovely (and busy) square. Worth a visit if you are in CPH. I was able to get some great pics.",
          "We purchased a combined ticket which gave us entry into the Palace, the Ruins, the Royal Kitchen and the Royal Stables. In total our visit was around 3 hours. Bags must be stored in lockers and they provide plastic covers which must be worn over your shoes. The Palace is very",
          "There were no ques and hardly any people which made it even more enjoyable. Lovely tour of the palace.",
          "Without knowing we arrived just in time for the tour. There are free tours at different times, you just need to pay the entrance free. The guide was fantastic, knowledgeable and keen to provide further information",
          "Been to many a palace/castle over the years....but many of them are, should I say it, stuffy old museums? This one has its museum part, yes, but is still a working facility in other parts! Nice to see some older art styles reworked in the modern idiom - tapestry dates back a",
          "The Palace is a great place to visit. Start with the Ruins, then the rest. I found the architecture quite impressive and the size of the Palace a lot bigger than one would expect from a relatively small country. The stables are quite interesting to see. I assume the cost of",
          "Many sections of the palace are there and we'll presented. What I like most is the Throne Room. The two thrones with red, gold, and white tones are truly majestic. Thanks God they were rescued amid fire long time ago.",
          "Get free entry included in your Copenhagen card. Visit part of the palace, the kitchens and stables. All very impressive and well designed to walk around. Also visit the tower lookout. Must visit for 2 hours or so.",
          "This place is legit. It takes you into the life\u2019s of the parliament as well as the royalty. But my favorite is the ruins. It\u2019s a must followed by the stables.",
          "Words can't express how much I enjoyed wondering the halls of this beautiful palace. It wasn't as busy as you would imagine and it felt so surreal. It isn't excessively ornate but it was amazing. You have to go.",
          "We bought the combo ticket, so we saw the The Royal Kitchen, The Royal Stables, and The Royal Reception Rooms, and everything worth it. If you only have time for one castle during your visit in Copenhagen, then you should do this one. A little tricky to find the entrance, but",
          "A little tricky to find the entrance but so worth it, beautiful palace, very impressive, and deserted when we went! Make sure you visit the other areas too like the sables and the underground ruins. The chapel was sadly closed when we went though, it only opens on a Sunday.",
          "Not huge amount to see as such but if you go at 12 Noon you see changing of the guard. The police control where you stand but there is a band and the theatre if the guards marching. Worth a look",
          "A very relaxed self guided tour of a beautiful and historic palace. I thoroughly enjoyed the details shown in each room and the very relaxed feeling despite the very grand environment. The palace was decorated for Christmas and it was a lovely insight to Danish Royalty.",
          "Well worth a visit if you have a Copenhagen card which gets you into all the museums and palace rooms. The queue for the (free) tower lift can be very long.",
          "One of the MUST SEE palaces in Europe. Centuries of royal pomp, splendour and high drama lie hidden in Christiansborg palace walls. It is said that the Queen uses much of the palace even today.",
          "We went at 4pm, on a Friday in November, not many others there, pretty much had the place to our selves! I in particular loved the tapestry room and the gorgeous library.",
          "We bought tickets for the entire grounds. Well worth it. Spent an easy 3 hours enjoying this Palace. The tower is free to go up. And you get a great view of the beautiful city.",
          "Fascinating to find out so much about the history of \u2018Haven\u2019 and its main castle then palace and that of the royal family in Denmark. The ruins underneath the palace are incredible and tell so many stories about the above. A must see place in Copenhagen.",
          "This city Palace is massive but not in an overwhelming way. The interiors are depictive of Danish royalty\u2019s wealth and power. Don\u2019t miss the convenient climb (it has a lift!) to the tower for breathtaking views of Copenhagen. Free-of-charge so expect a long queue.",
          "We popped in to the shop and got a glimpse of the inside of this royal palace. There are 4 areas you can visit and we just did not have the time. The shop is all top quality things and we noticed that there was lockers and overshoes for people visiting. Will have to return for a",
          "The Christiansberg palace is small and intresting but don't expect too much else disappointment awaits you.",
          "Beautiful complex right off boat tour. Visited the palace, walked the grounds. Library very characteristic",
          "There are lots of construction work on the road with barricades and fences and does not provide good direction entrance to the palace. Going up to the Tower must not be missed which required to take 3 different lifts to the top each reducing the number of passengers. Once at",
          "The Royal Stables are part of Christianborg Palace and well worth a visit. These days they are only open on Saturday and Sundays at 14:00. The Show grounds and the two stables\u2019 wings are the only parts of Christian IV\u2019s grandiose baroque palace having survived several",
          "We started our visit around 2:00 PM. We visited the stables, the kitchen, reception rooms, and the ruins. We took the guided tour of the reception rooms which was very informative but the tour guide was a bit long winded. By the time the tour was done we didn\u2019t have enough",
          "We visited the tower on Friday when we were in Copenhagen. There was just a short queue which took maybe 10 mins. There is a lift to the tower and it is free access. There are great views of the city at the top and it is a must if you are in Copenhagen.",
          "Lovely place to visit we did the whole tour and it was great. Very interesting particularly the ruins which gave an incite into the long history of the site.",
          "Christiansborg is one of the most beautiful palaces I've ever visited. The decorative detail in the palace is incredible. I'd definitely recommend a visit during your time in Copenhagen.",
          "Unfortunately I was only able to visit the Kitchens, Ruins, Chapel and Stables as the Royal Reception Rooms we\u2019re closed for about 2-3 weeks for some reason thus the average rating. Seemed an odd time to close as I visited during what proved to be Denmark fall school break.",
          "We went here and happen to see the changing of the guard which was really cool. I would highly recommend stopping by here if you have the time.",
          "Chrisiansborg palace is right in the heart of Copenhagen and is well connected. This palace is huge in structure and has multiple partitions. We were unlucky that we couldn't go inside the palace as it was closed for the visitors at that hour. The overall area and the palace are",
          "The palace is really great from the outside but you have to climb to the tower (for free) to enjoy the view of Cph ! You can see almost all the buildings and also Sweden !",
          "To go up the tower is free, you have to queue for a short while most likely as you need to go through airport type security (as it is the parliament building) but it us very slick once you're moving. There are elevators most of the way up, only a few stairs at the very top. The",
          "Totally stunning and opulent, and it's amazing to see where the Danish monarchy holds banquets and balcony appearances. You'll get some great photos here and see truly interesting art and architecture. I'd also recommend that you do a Mystery Hunt by picking up a box from",
          "A nice palace where the current royals live is open to public from a small distance is quite nice. An excellent architecture.",
          "We went here first around 5:30pm, unfortunately it closed (not sure why). Luckily, we returned the day after and could go to the top of the Tower. We stood in a line for 20 minutes, and then went through security checking counter, took 2 lifts to get to the top. It's completely",
          "Went here on Copenhagen\u2019s cultural night. We only saw the receiving rooms. So beautifully decorated. Modern mixed with old. Fascinating history of the fires as well. Best part was the library.",
          "We stumbled on the palace within our first hour of being in Copenhagen and when it happened to be open for Culture Night. And it was fantastic! A gorgeous but really quite understated palace compared to others in Europe; fascinating history really well laid out and engaging.",
          "I have visited the palace in Oct. I bought a combi-ticket online, in advance to avoid queening (but actually there weren't a lot of visitors). The reception rooms are quite nice, i also recommend the Tower (you get a nice overview of the city); we have visited also the horses",
          "First of all check out the opening hours as, sometimes, they perform internal works and maintenance closing some of the areas. Worth going up in the tower or down to the dungeons. You can choose what to visit depending on your area of interest. Rooms, kitchen, tower, horse",
          "We visited the palace to go up the tower for an amazing view of Copenhagen. It's free to go up. There is 1 lift up, and numbers are limited to 40 at a time on the viewing platform. We queued but it moved quickly. Worth it for the fantastic views when up there. There's also a",

          "This is a well laid out tour of the palace with access to the many official rooms including the throne room. It is a very pleasant tour and the art work and crafts are exquisite. A must see.",
          "100% recommend going here even though it is a tad pricier. The rooms are decedent and you feel like royalty. There is also a lot of history to learn about here",
          "Viewed the Palace grounds and stayed for the changing of the guard at 12:00 noon. Very ceremonial but rather boring compared to some others we witnessed in other countries. Afterwards stroll the water front and find some great cafes and bar/restaurants.",
          "We arrived when it opened and checked put all but the chapel as this was closed. The Reception rooms and ruins are by far the most interesting and where you'd spend the most time. Easy to get to and loads more stuff near it too",
          "Breathtaking simply breathtaking! Me and my boyfriend visited in the end of September; we both had a Copenhagen card so it had free entry into all of the areas of the Christiansborg Palace. The Royal Kitchen was a little disappointing and if we had paid to enter the kitchen we",
          "Of all the palace parts, the ruins were the most interesting and well-signed. The royal reception rooms are gorgeous but worth a visit only if you have time to spare. (Go for Rosenborg hands down if you have to choose.) Signage is sparse and the rooms are still in occasional use",
          "Ok so I\u2019ve seen more impressive architecture in Europe however this was just so chilled. No intense security and watching the horses being exercised in the morning sun was beautiful. The tower tour is free and gives you a good view of Copenhagen.",
          "Christiansborg Palace is in the centre of Copenhagen. It was built in 1928 and is where the Danish Parliament sit and the Danish Prime Ministers Office is. The Danish Monarch also uses the palace for royal receptions. The Royal chapel is also located there. The building is like",
          "Really beatiful and interesting place worth visiting. You can also visit tower where is great sight of city. During the way up to the tower You can read some articles about history of Christianborg and see some historic photos. There is elevator so You do not have to take the",

          "If you are looking to know the Danish history then this is a must visit place. The rooms and all are showcasing the real old life and it will take us to a new level of knowledge. Don\u2019t miss out the royal kitchen and as well as the stables. Check out for the stables opening time",
          "Walking through the palace was a great way to be introduced to Danish history. Signs and storyboards were in English. We took about an hour to explore the palace. Beautiful artwork and antiques.",
          "We went on a Saturday and were able to catch a free tour of the ruins. It was very interesting and entertaining. The royal reception rooms were beautiful and the signs were very informative. This is a must see when you are in Copenhagen!",
          "A beautiful building filled with gorgeous art. Incredible collection of Rodin sculptures. A must for art lovers.",
          "There\u2019s lots to see at the Christiansborg Palace. There are magnificent and richly decorated reception rooms, which are used by the Danish Royal family parties, gala banquets and ambassadorial audiences. The kitchens are also open to the public and they are a lot of fun to",
          "We visited a couple of the tours of Christiansborg palace including the ruins and the state rooms. The staff were very helpful. There are quiet a few stairs, but there may have been wheelchair access. Everything was well presented. I lost my iPhone in one of these areas at the",
          "There is so much to see here, I suggest you pick and choose what is of most interest and leave the rest. Combination tickets that last for 48 hours can be bought at reception. I suggest going up the tower early in the day to avoid lines",
          "This location has so many spots you can go and check out, and if you get the Copenhagen Card, make sure you do not miss any of them. I missed the Royal Stables, it is only open for a couple of hours each day, but the rest of this spot is amazing. Lots of interesting history and",
          "This palace is decorating goals if you want to feel Royal all the time. Be aware that you cannot take backpacks or anything in with you, but they provide free lockers to stow your things while you tour the palace. You also need to wear blue booties over your street shoes! We",
          "Walking around the square of buildings is gorgeous, watching the guards change, and the museum is large enough to see in an hour but full of fun rooms. I love how they offer a cubicle to store you coat/purse/umbrella while you are in the museum.",
          "This stop was part of our walking tour. The royal horses were out for training while we were there. It was interesting.",
          "Went here as part of the free walking tour and this is a really nice place to visit. There are some great opportunities to get some photos of the horse and carriages being ridden round the grounds. You can climb the tower for some good views of Copenhagen so well worth going",
          "We visit Christianborgs Palace especcially for the view from the tower. There is an elevator, that brings you almost to the top for free. The last floor an only be reached by stairs. But it is worth is, and advisable as one of the first things to do in Copenhagen. You get an",
          "Absolutely wonderful Palace only 5-10 min walk from Glyptotek Museum. Very picturesque Palace. We went upto the Tower which involved two lifts and and small stairwell and the top you can see from four sides over Copenhagen. They also have a restaurant up the top with some",
          "This is a beautiful palace and worth visiting for the changing of the guard and the tour. But for me, the tapestries that we\u2019re a gift to the Queen on her 50th Birthday was the real draw. They were exquisite. I\u2019ve seen them twice now and I am sure I could find something new if I",
          "This is an amazing and beautifully maintained Palace, that the Royal family don't live in, but undertake certain royal engagements in. I chose to buy a combination ticket (150dkk) and with it visited the palace itself, the old ruins which is a very detailed museum of the history",
          "Visited as part of a Gate1 trip. Glad we did as it was very beautiful. Having a guide helped us with the fine details and history behind the story. Amazing architecture. I would recommend.",
          "Christiansborg Palace is a palace and government building on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It was built between the years 1907-1928 with facades plated with granite. Here is the Folketing (Danish Parliament) that can be visited, but you must apply for",
          "Well worth making the effort to be there around noon as the changing of the guard is great (not as dramatic as London or Ottawa) but worth seeing all the same",
          "Lovely place to wander around. There is a viewing platform in the tower. Not a bad view of the old town!",
          "We queued up for the lift which takes you up the tower viewing point where you can enjoy the beautiful panoramic views of Copenhagen. There is 15-20 minutes wait for the lift due to restrictions on number of people who can take the lift. It was worth it. One can also take a",
          "The glamorous royal apartments are richly decorated with works of art, chandeliers gold and marble. Worth a visit.",
          "Located in the Castle Island. It is beautiful and they have a beautiful garden with a fountain too. Worth visiting.",
          "For me this was the best castle that I visted in Denmark. Great day. Huge place. And the gardens are just perfect. Try to get there early to avoid busses as much as possible",
          "This was the first European palace my wife had ever seen. The palace is beautiful and the admission price is reasonable.",
          "One of the royal palaces in Copenhagen. There is separate tour up to the bell tower with beautiful views of Copenhagen",

          "house of parliament and the queen and the courts. fun to see the seat of government and all the pomp, thrown room etc. ventured into the basement to see the ruins of the 1167 castle. A trip up the tower is also very nice for a view of the city",

          "Our SPB tour included this visit. The tapestry room alone is well worth the visit. How unusual that the palace houses the royal family plus parliament and the Supreme Court. The palace is beautiful and elegant but not overly ornate or opulent. There\u2019s lots of history to enjoy",
          "Surely, a beautiful palace worth to see in when Copenhagen. Go up to the tower to have a beautiful view over the city",
          "We went on the English guided tour and had a very passionate guide explaining everything especially the modern tapestries. We saw the kitchen too",
          "In the city of Royal palaces here is another treat. Palace where new kings and queens are presented to Copenhagers. Magnificent tapestries and historic furniture and the hall where royalty host banquets and where awards are made to citizens. See the royal throne and the balcony",
          "The royal family has not lived here in over 200 years, but the people need to have something of theirs, that they can call their own. And of course we have the Royal Stables and those horses parade around town...it seems like all the time, at least every time we have visited.",
          "I would definitely recommend you visiting here and getting a combination ticket to visit the kitchen, the stables, the ruins and the reception rooms. You get to see a wide range of royal history and see beautiful sites at the same time",
          "We were told when going on the harbor run that we were able to get up into the tower at Christiansborg Palace. So we did just that! It was quite some view from up there out over the many green and red roof tops of the houses of Copenhagen. It was even possible to see the big",

          "The Royal Reception Rooms are elegant and still function when the queen entertains visiting dignitaries. The works of art are reason enough to visit the palace. Beautiful china, sculptures, and decorations of gold are reminiscent of Versailles. What struck me though were the",
          "This is beautiful saw the kitchens and stables lovely horse and carriage and the rooms in the palace are beautifull",
          "As royal palaces go, Christiansborg is a model of tasteful restraint. We bought a combination ticket which was excellent value: it gave us admission to the state reception rooms (elegant), the huge palace kitchen (interesting), the Ruins (remains of former palaces and",
          "Perhaps I didn\u2019t give this place as much time and energy as I should have. Not much open to see and the line was incredibly long to go up in the tower so we skipped that part. Beautiful building for sure though. Worth the time to at least walk around the area.",
          "no guided tour on the day of my visit, some kind of commentary would have made a lot of difference. the royal reception room, the royal kitchen, and the ruins were quite interesting and quite modest in comparison to other royalties.",
          "We visited the ruins, the kitchen, the state rooms, royal stables. It was great to walk through the state rooms and take photos - great pieces of art/furniture. I love visiting old horse carriages and while this is a small collection still nice to see.",
          "Had a hard time finding the entrance to the Royal Reception rooms. The Royal Reception rooms are gorgeous & well worth seeing. Was extremely glad we arrived early in the morning. It was much easier taking pictures. The Ruins, The Royal Stables & The Royal Kitchen were",
          "This is by far my favourite of Copenhagen's numerous palaces (each with their own distinct look and feel). It's a little pricey when you only go to see the palace itself, but if you head to the ruins and the stables on your trip, it becomes slightly better value. This palace,",
          "It's definitely a must see, such place needs to be seen to believe. It's worth your time. One can drool on the opulence of the place.",
          "There are so many fascinating things in this palace. Not only does it have beautiful rooms of grand scale but also the most amazing ruins underneath where you can view the foundations of the various palaces that have stood on the same site over the centuries. Fascinating!",
          "It's great that you can get so close to where the royals live in Denmark. And they all live between 4 castles grouped in a circle. The architecture is interesting, and while the square is loaded with tourists but it is nice to see it. It helps to have a good guide to explain",
          "Nice architecture but only one small museum is open to visit. The rest of the buildings are private. Get your photo with the guards and move on.",
          "A significant part of Copenhagen's history the palace is an attraction not to be missed. Enjoy the pageantry of the changing of the guard, the history of the ruling family and the beauty of the palace and grounds.",
          "We took a guided tour of the palace and it was completely worth it. It is bit difficult to locate the starting place of the guided tour. but once you each the place, then it is completely worth the effort. The website also needs a bit of more informration on how to approach the",
          "This is a really neat place. It's a working facility, meaning it's actively used by the government. There are 4 different spots to see, each has it's own admissions price and ticket. I'd recommend seeing them all if you like history. Definitly take the guided tour of the",
          "What a wonderful palace this is. From the lovely and very intricate inlaid wood parquet floors, to the artwork on the walls and ceilings, to the breathtaking chandeliers, this is a place not to be missed. One room had five identical extravagant chandeliers, one for each",
          "Every area and room in the palace is delightful but the large room containing the large tapestries, commissioned by Queen Margaret to commemorate her 60th birthday, is the absolute highlight. The tapestries illustrate the history of Denmark in vivid colors.",
          "This was way more than I expected. The tower had great views of the city. Plus the queen reception room and the tapestries were amazing. You also get to see the kitchens, the stables and underneath the castle. That is the foundations of the old castles. You also learn how it",
          "Definetly one of the must see, it's nice walk around and then by the river. But it's nothing special.",
          "The kitchen visit was fun, lots of exhibits and information. The stables are fabulous and great to see some of the Royal horses!",
          "Must leave all belongings in a locker, short of a camera. This is a very small area of the palace that they let you into. The outer courtyard was more impressive.",
          "For the Tower experience, I'm sure you read they only allow 40 at a time, so you'll most likely have to wait to ride up 2 different elevators and then walk 2 flights of spiraled stairs. But once up, there's beautiful views for miles in all 4 directions. Strollers not",
          "I wouldn\u2019t say this is worth the time \u2014the rosenborg is much nicer and better if you have kids. It wasn\u2019t crowded and the rooms are beautiful but once you\u2019ve seen Versailles a palace is a palace ! We had the Copenhagen card so we just popped in but it\u2019s not worth full price",
          "The Palace is made up of four matching buildings built for merchants. The Queen lives in one, Crown Prince and family in another, other relatives in a third and the fourth is for official visitors. The royals come and go. The soldiers are guarding the buildings. The location is",

          "Learn 45 minutes of facts about the monarchy, parliament, and Denmark in a super friendly tour. We loved our visit!",
          "We visited the palace and walked around the grounds (did not have time for a tour, or to go up the tower). The buildings and grounds are quite impressive, and span a large area right in the middle of town. Well worth seeing even if you only have time to stroll through in passing.",
          "We spent several delightful hours visiting Christianborg Palace while we were staying in Copenhagen in June 2018. Located on Slotsholmen Island near the Inner Harbor area, the present impressive structure which was rebuilt in the early 20th century now houses both the Royal",

          "Although we would happily have visited the whole palace we had already visited Rosenborg and Amalienborg. Had read we could visit the tower for free - it\u2019s true. Make your way around the palace to get under the tower. There\u2019s a queue for security and the lift. We waited just",
          "This lovely palace is not far from the river,there was construction work going on in the front but once you walked through to the back you could get a lovely view of this palace. The architecture is amazing and there appeared to be plenty of people doing the tours. There is a",
          "Visiting the Christian VX1 Palace was a delight. This is where the present King in waiting lived before his marriage to Mary and gives an insight into the every day life of the Danish Royals. A beautiful Palace filled with tasteful furnishings and artwork, it was easy to spend",
          "This vast building and courtyard is right behind the new harbour so you can visit both at the same time",
          "We have seen better, not in Denmark but in Europe. If there was one big negative it was that it has burned down, more than once and been rebuilt! SO all though it may look really old it is not! That said if your in towna nd have a pass, it is a top attraction for sure!",
          "So we did the Copenhagen card all 120 hours and we think it\u2019s great, for the Christianborg palace we really liked the receiving rooms, there weren\u2019t very many people so it was great to take pictures. The itchens can be covered in about 20 minutes, if we didn\u2019t have the card we",
          "Was amazed at the way this was set and the history surrounding it, The road leading to it has a long park and many things for people to do",
          "The royal palace really is a must see for any tourist visiting Copenhagen. Really terrific architecture m. Well with a visit",
          "The palace has a few visitors. I first visited the tower, it was free but worth about 20 minutes wait. The view on the top was pretty good. I then bought a ticket and visited the palace. The ticket cover four places: the palace, the stable, the kitchen and the underground. All",
          "The first (paid) attraction stop on our 24 hour Copenhagen Card was in Christianborg Palace. While easily walkable, the location is near several metro stops and many additional attractions that ultimately save you time when you are on a compressed schedule. This palace is",
          "It is Must Item in Copenhagen including the climb to the tower (the waiting time for lift can be up to 40 mts) the place also include the visit to the Stable and Royal Kitchen",
          "Lovely that these grounds are open to the public. I think it shows what kind of society Denmark is. Lots of beautiful architecture and museums, we found it pleasant to just walk the grounds and gawk at the sights, using the Copenhagen card to enter ticketed attractions that we",
          "We visited using the Copenhagen Card (well worth it by the way) and spent a lovely couple of hours here. The stables were lovely but the horses were on their holidays so didn\u2019t get to see them unfortunately. The Royal Reception Rooms were stunning. It wasn\u2019t too of my list to",
          "We had the Copenhagen City card which I would recommend to see the sights of the city. So we visited all the places in the Palace and had a good time. I actually really enjoyed the kitchens and watched the video because I find it fascinating that they make most of the food for",

          "Really enjoyed the castle (construction at the front) but still quite grand and make sure you get the history (all the fires and reconstruction). We really enjoyed going down into the ruins and seeing the old foundations and learning the history of the 1300 castles that",
          "Regrettably missed out on visiting the Royal Stables, etc., as I had spent a majority of my time over in Roskilde in early morning. The visit to Roskilde was well worth the visit; however, I would\u2019ve liked to have seen this palace. The wee bit I did see was quite impressive,",
          "There are multiple exhibitions: underground, kitchen, the stables, palace. They did a fantastic job. There are three castles: Rosenborg, Amelienborg, and Christianborg. I would say Rosenborg and Christianborg are must see! They did a fantastic job with theses castles. We",
          "The Palace and surrounding grounds are very beautiful. Looking out from the water on one side and at the other end a stunning Cathedral very worth a visit, even if you are over Cathedrals. Statues, fountains, guards and plenty more",
          "Its a royal compound thats interesting because of its occupants and the guards rather than being architecturally amazing. Its not a destination must see rather include it as part of a stroll around the city.",
          "So much history so close to the centre of town. It was good being able to walk around this area. I paid to see the horse carriages and museum, which was 40kr/5,5\u20ac/5\u00a3/6$ And well worth it. Unfortunately the horses which are usually stabled here were being put out to grass between",
          "There was some sort of power failure when we stopped here, and unfortunately nothing was open. We did see the outside, which was impressive. We were biased in favor of this place after seeing the Danish TV Series \"Borgen\", which was filmed here.",
          "This is well worth a visit. It's a collection of buildings ranging from the palace, parliament building, to kitchens, stables and a tower. Keep in mind that you might not get into all the sections on the day you visit? We didn't get into the parliament building or up the tower.",
          "I went for the Queens tapestries and they are marvellous! Do go with a guide, the experience will be so much more! Fun and interesting facts. I highly recommend a visit to Christiansborg.",
          "The tapestries in the main hall are stunning. Get a guided tour as it\u2019s worth it for this place. Also enjoyed the ruins under the castle.",
          "Today was 'Palace' Day - First Stop Christiansborg Palace. Today this is now a multi-use building complex, one wing is the Parliament, another is the Royal apartments, and in the centre is a large area where the horses are exercised next to the Royal stables. There are various",

          "My group took a free tour which helped us know what we were seeing. However, lots of time was taken in the tapestry room, but it was interesting. However, we did miss seeing some of the rooms and didn't realize it until after we walked out. There is construction around and it",
          "It was great to be able to go into the palace and see all its art work. It was a shame that we weren't allowed to touch things (like the heavily decorated doors) as this would have given more to the experience for my partner who is blind. However, we appreciate this is a working",
          "Grand AND accessible. An absolute delight! The reception rooms, the kitchen, the ruins, the stables -- just magnificent. The tower was not open the day I visited (closed on Mondays). Spend as much time as you like wandering through the various reception rooms of the palace,",

          "We admired the palace and the horses out in front. Beautiful grounds. We didn't get to go inside as we were on a walking tour, but definitely worth passing by!",

          "If you buy a combination ticket here, you get entrance to the reception rooms, royal kitchen, old castle ruins, and the stables. The royal family no longer lives here, but royal functions are still occasionally held in the reception rooms, which are very grand; so grand that you",
          "In my visit I was able to see the stables (horses sadly on vacation), ruins under the palace, old kitchen and the entertaining rooms. The entertainment rooms are spectacular with the tapestries and chandeliers I really enjoyed those. The ruins are kind of creepy if you are",

          "This is a lovely Royal palace, although it's a bit bare where some of the expensive furniture and antiques have been replaces with something simpler. there are some very interesting paintings. This is free with the Copenhagen card which is very good value. Well worth a visit for",

          "We expected a lot more. It was on the one hand overly ornate (over-blown pseudo Frenchified) while on the other, austere to the point of cheap (pretty badly painted marble effect instead of actual marble). The modern tapestries were also not to my taste: cartoonish bordering on",

          "We visited Christiansborg Palace on a free walking tour of the city and whilst the viewing tower was closed on the day of the tour we returned on the following day to queue for a free trip to the tower. The lift to the fourth floor only takes eight so a little wait ensued but",
          "We were taken to visit this palace whilst on a cruise trip tour. A lovely location as you can stand in the palace grounds. Unfortunately our timing wasn't right to capture the changing of the guard. On the other side of the road is a beautiful refreshing fountain and a lovely",

          "This palace is where the Queen greets royalty, presidents and the people in audience. We went to see the Royal stables, the Royal kitchen and medieval ruins beneath the palace. We also saw the main entrance to the Royal Stables with the two Rococo pavilions on each side of the",
          "I recommend getting there right when the reception rooms open at 9; the palace is pretty big, and there's plenty to see in Copenhagen. Also, most attractions don't open until 10am, so starting here is a good way to make the best use of your time. That said, they accept the",
          "Just like visits to other palaces, so much wealth, on display. Friendly staff, but self-guided tour is fine with the map provided. Lots of explanatory stands in the rooms. Chapel only open on Sundays. Kitchen has video about serving a banquet which is informative",
          "We only had time to walk around the outside of this lovely place. I woukd think a formal tour woukd be worth it, and we hope to return to do that one day. Still lots of pretty photo opportunities outside, and worth going to either way",
          "This was anti-climatic. We walked down there, got into the square and thought...ok now what? we watched the changing of the guards, but that wasn't anything that special. I guess worth a see, but not worth going out of your way.",
          "The guided tour of the reception rooms (which we just happened to arrive in time for) greatly enhanced our experience. The guide was enthusiastic and charming and shared many details that weren\u2019t addressed on placards. We thought the copper kitchen was lovely to see and the",
          "Apart from its beautiful exterior, there is a free viewing platform to visit for beautiful views of the city. It is accessible by elevator for free from the main center entrance. Groups of 40 are taken at a time, and you have to go through security, so plan to spend at least",
          "It is a functioning palace, so tourists are required to wear plastic shoe covers to keep the floors clean. I only paid to enter the Royal Reception Rooms. The rooms are decorated with regal furniture, paintings, and tapestries. Going up the tower is free. You get a view of",

          "Christiansborg Palace is beautiful and interesting since it is actively used by the Danish Royal family. It was fun to see all the beautiful rooms and then look through the European magazines to see the rooms in use. The Palace is airy and modern.",
          "We did not manage to visit the premise as it was closed by the time it was there. There was horse droppings on the cobble line street which was not cleared. The palace appeared nice otherwise for photo taking.",
          "A short stroll from the waterfront ,well worth a visit. If you can't get to the changing of the guard at 12pm go at 10 am when there is a \"mini changeover\" of the guard with less people and you can get up close to the guards.",
          "An excellent place to visit - full of history and descriptions in English. We spent a few very pleasant hours here.",
          "It's a really big palace where the Danish parliament resides but for me it was more impressive from outside. I think that you should save your money for the Rosenborg castle.",
          "You need to sign up online or get there early to get some tickets for the parliament tour. We had a great Danish tour guide who was fun and very informative of the legislative proceedings in Denmark. Beautiful art work and architecture! I think it's definitely worth a visit. I",
          "Museum offers several rooms that have been preserved or reconstructed, but it doesn't have the feel of really seeing a castle. Save your entrance fee for another castle in Copenhagen.",
          "The Guard actually let me take the pictures of him. People disrespectfully kept getting too close to him & annoying him. I could see he was cross angry. So I asked him politely if I could take his photo he smiled & and stood to attention. So I took the photo and then I said",
          "This is where the inner workings of the Danish government resides - Danish Parliament, Supreme Court and the Prime Minister's offices. Several fires destroyed the old place and it has since been reconstructed. Very impressive and should be a must visit for most visitors to",
          "We walked through the grounds of the palace and were lucky to watch a horseman practicing his dressage in the central paddock area. Around the back are some beautiful secluded gardens where you can sit and relax with a lovely water feature in the centre.",
          "This is a terrific place to visit and I'd say it even is a must see when in Copenhagen. It has really interesting and beautiful items and the views from the tower top are great and we'll worth the trip up in my opinion. You do have security check and give yourself plenty of",
          "You must visit this palace if you are in Copenhagen. It is newer than other palace because it was reconstructed following some fires, so you will see simpler, less colored rooms, but still reach and tasteful.",
          "A gorgeous big and extravagant palace its what you will see when you visit Christianborg Palace. Well reserved as its been use still in use, its a must attraction in Copenhagen.",
          "When we arrived we nearly went in the Parliament entrance as we didn't see any signs for the palace entrance. Once we found out exactly where to go we did the self tour around the main palace and the kitchens. There was lots of interesting information and some beautiful artwork",
          "We enjoyed this Palace. We toured on a Sunday and did not wait in line. Did the self guided tour and enjoyed a comfortable pace throughout. Offered a lot of history. This is located next to the National Museum so was convenient to visit both.",
          "The view from the tower was only okay, but it was free! You also take 2 elevators so you don't have to walk up many steps. If the line isn't too long definitely go for it, but I wouldn't spend a long time waiting on line for it.",
          "If you have time and you dont wanna spend any money you can climb the tower of this castle. It is free but you need to prepare for long queues. We didnt bother and enjoyed the garden behind (near the Jewish Museum) and the stables on the other side. We also learnt a tour is",
          "The chance to see the Royal Reception Rooms at Christiansborg Palace was a welcome break from my long walk from the cruise terminal on a cold and windy May Day 2018. The rooms themselves are the star attraction here in that they are not, for the most part, filled with antique",
          "Elvis used to live here before moving to Memphis where he got his big break. That said, it would be an appropriate household for the Danish Royal Family. A large square flanked by 4 large palace styled buildings. Like most European Royalty, the Danish are not to be outdone.",
          "No real plans to take a trip here but as the wind was so cold we thought it would offer a break from the weather. We were glad we did as it was a very enjoyable walk round the palace with plenty to keep us interested.",
          "This is quite a spectacular palace located in the centre of Copenhagen with a lot of history and a stunning interior. I won't give away too much as its part of the fun to explore and learn whist visiting. Having burnt down several times the palace has been rebuilt and restored",
          "This is where the danish royalty and parliament meet. We are able to visit the royal rooms, the royal stables, the royal kitchen and the ruins. As a bonus you can also climb the tower (elevator and stairs) and have a great view of Copenhagen.There is also a very good (but a bit",
          "We had the Copenhagen card, so we got free admittance into all areas of the palace. The ruins were really cool! The reception hall and palace were equally as good. Would definitely recommend getting the ticket to go in all areas. The fact the place is still in use on occasion is",
          "It was a calm Place where to take a bite and also climbing the Tower for some views of the city, the restaurant is a bit expenssive",
          "Great to walk around the parliament buildings and the view from the tower was worth the queue. well worth visiting and not very crowed early afternoon",
          "One of the palaces in Denmark and worth a visit. Has a lookout point for a great view of the city center.",
          "This palace is bigger and brighter than Rosenborg. The grand rooms are impressive but the real highlight is the modern tapestries that tell the history of Denmark. Everyone must wear covers on their shoes so be careful not to slip.",
          "Very posh palace, equal to any in Europe. Was under construction when we were there. Still pleasantly killed a few hours going through the palace.",
          "Throughly enjoyed our time here. We were lucky to get on a guided tour of the Royal rooms. It was excellent and very informative. Be sure to go up in the tower, it\u2019s free and has great views!",
          "The palace is definately worth spending an entire day.. the royal kitchen the royal stable the ruins all r worth seeing .. it took us almost half day to see the entire palace and still we wanted to see more . The palace tower is amazing",
          "We headed to Christiansborg to visit the Royal palace, kitchens and stables. It was a bit difficult to see where you entered the buildings and we ended up walking around until we saw the signs outside the buildings. It is free with the Copenhagen card and there were zero queues.",
          "Everywhere in Copenhagen you can get right up close to everything. We walked alongside one of the Queen's horses as it went to its stable! You can go up the tower, but the views aren't amazing. Nice enough architecture, but really quite small for a palace.",
          "Absolutely fab and well worth a visit! We loved how romantic and charming it was. We were lucky as there were not many visitors due to the weather at the time.",
          "The tower is free to go up and open quite late. It's worth visiting for the view from the tower. You get a 360 view of the city from the 4 vantage points in the tower. We went during the day and during night to see the lights. It's worth going both times. It can get busy so try",
          "Free visit to top of tower / tarnet. Good views across the whole city possibly Sweden on a clear day. Security scan your bag on arrival but doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes",
          "The Palace itself is a lovely spot to have a stroll. My wife and I went into the museum which was alright, but nothing out of the ordinary. We went on New Years Day as it was one of the only museums open that day. What made this a special visit was we were treated to a duo",
          "Many of the places to visit are closed on Mondays so be prepared to do something else. The Ruins were very cool. The castle was impressive especially since they use it for various galas presently. Would love to attend one of those. It does take a while to walk through everything",
          "Here\u2019s a tip: the tower is free! It\u2019s also quite interesting & the views at the top Are beautiful. There\u2019s a small elevator that takes groups of 8ish at a time to the top & you can see all of Copenhagen-and I\u2019ve heard Sweden-and it\u2019s really pretty. Further, there\u2019s quite a few",
          "I really enjoyed exploring the palace and amazing free tower enterance.well maintined palace.easy reached by walk.interisting royal palace",
          "As you can see there are tons of reviews in here! I think that tells more than my words. It's a luxurious palace with a nice touch of modern times. Remember to check the Theather museum nearby!",
          "Really wonderful site... plenty to see and check out. Check out the stables and the Royal Kitchens if you have time...",
          "In the middle of March, around mid-day, I had this place practically to myself - a real bonus. The palace is beautifully cared for and there is enough interesting information in each room to give guests a bit of background without them suffering from information overload.",
          "Copenhagen is best seen from the seat of a bicycle! There are plenty of rental bikes in shops and in hotels and safe bicycle lanes so we found this the most interesting way to get around this beautiful city. Walking is fine - but there is so much to see you can cover more",
          "The Christiansborg palace stands in the heart of city. Although there is no access to the main building to visitors during weekdays as the building is used by parliament but entrance to Tower is free. Every one has to go through a security check before being allowed. You can go",
          "We saw the lot - palace, kitchen, the ruins and stables. We didn't go up the tower as we're not good with heights. The staff is friendly and if you like a bit of hisotry, palaces and big rooms with pictures then this place is perfect. The only thing we'd say is that the horses",
          "I really enjoyed exploring the palace and the tapestries room is amazing. We paid for the full tickets, however, felt that it may be worth just paying for the main palance ticket and walk around the grounds for free. There is a tower which is free to go up, but has a low",
          "Best kept secret. The tapestries are recent productions - not what you normally think of - but 9 in a series which relates the history of Copenhagen and Denmark from early Middle Ages to \u201cthe Future\u201d. There is a printed guide - which lists only very summary info - and a",
          "I wandered over here after visiting nice markets, antique shops, book stores, and a cafe all on a quaint street 200 meters away. The history is everywhere and one really needs to slow down and take it all in. I wandered the courtyard all the way to the water and the views and",
          "We have visited this place twice in two years but this time around we had a local friend who gave us a tour guide and explained the change of guards, etc. It is really fascinating and worth a visit but better with a guide",
          "I am in love with this area! It has a very interesting history. At first I taught that this place could be a bit dangerous but later I figured out that the atmosphere is really friendly and bohemian.",
          "Found this on a free walking tour. Didn't go inside but I heard you could go up the tower for free, which I did, and the views were amazing",
          "Great palace, really worth a visit. Impressed with the information and how the current mixes with the history. Interesting about the fires, brings home the reality of how poorly organised places used to be.",
          "This was the best part of the trip. The palace rooms were stunning reminding my friend and I of beauty and the beast. The kitchen was interesting to see and the ruins were a little eery. The stables were nice to see and the tower had a fantastic view of Copenhagen.",
          "We had a walk through the Christiansborg Palace whilst on a 2 day trip to the city. The area really is lovely, very well maintained and thoroughly interesting to have a stroll around. Plenty of photo opportunities to be sure to carry a camera. A free trip up the tower is",
          "Great buildings, lovely area and, if you get there before noon you can watch the changing of the guard which is quite interesting.",
          "This is by far one of THE most beautiful palaces I've visited in all of Europe. We were going to skip it as we've been to tons of castles, but was told by our host to be sure to visit it, and boy were we glad! Don't miss the live orchestra that plays from a colossal music box",
          "Great visit with loads to see and read. Even though it's not cheap to get the combo ticket it is probably worth it especially if it is cold in Copenhagen and you need a few hours inside! State rooms are beautiful. Make sure to use the audio guide on your smart phone for the",
          "A veritable history lesson about Denmark, the home of the actual monarchy, one of the must see tourists objectives while in Copenhagen !",
          "If you\u2019re budget is low, this is the Tower for you! It\u2019s free! And there\u2019s a lift after a quick mag and bag check at the bottom. Two lifts up and two short flights of stairs. Toilets on penultimate level opposite restaurant. Top of 2nd lift are a few surprises...sculptures,",
          "Such a majestic palace! This is a must visit if you are in Copenhagen. The kitchens are particularly good. You can pop in after/before tivoli as they are in near proximity of each other.",
          "Awesome place to walk alone. Some one who visit Copenhagen must see this wonderful point. Lovely historic palace",
          "Visit the palace, the stables, the ruins underneath. Make sure you visit the kitchens too, the lady who was working here was so informative and very friendly she made us feel so welcome. Also don't miss the tower as the views of the city are really good from here. A really",
          "First box all what I like in this particular Palace is that there are not crowds of tourists, so you can really take your time and enjoy the place. Don't miss the kitchen! Admission was included in Copenhagen card what was really nice. The only thing I didn't like was the",
          "We enjoyed the views from the tower (which was free) first. Then we explored the Ruins beneath the palace and the Royal Reception Rooms. Both were very interesting. All information was in both Danish & English.",
          "The Royal Reception rooms tour is exceptionally interesting allowing access to multiple areas of the Palace used for hosting official events, the artwork varies from classic to modern and is excellent. The Castle ruins tour provides an exceptionally detailed history lesson.",
          "We spent a few hours in the afternoon here. Would definitely recommend waiting for the English speaking tour at 3pm for the royal rooms (I think this is daily), which was very clear and informative. The tour covered most of the royal rooms. Tour is free, and there were about 12",
          "This is really six visits in one - the Royal Apartments , the Stables , the archeological crypt , the old kitchens , the chapel and the tower , but fortunately you don\u2019t have to do them all in one hit . So we thought it worthwhile buying the combined pass , and doing two",

          "So we didn't actually go in the Palace as we didn't have enough time, but we did go up the tower, which is completely free of charge. So worth it, you don't even have to climb up as there's a lift and the views from the top were amazing. You can see all of Copenhagen, including",

          "Our Copenhagen card only covered the reception hall aka tapestry rooms. It wasn\u2019t very crowded at all. There\u2019s poor signage, so we tend to see where other people are heading to before we discovered where the entrance was. Tickets were available at the gift shop where we had to",

          "Beautiful palace and beautiful square in front of it for a night/dawn stroll. The view of the river next to it and the light during the night I think represents the real essence of what Copenhagen city is. It's a stop that everyone visiting Copenhagen should do at least once.",

          "Went here as a group for the Mystery Hunt game, which was funny enough. Other than that, this place is not for types like me, who doesn't like to look at paintings and old stuff. But if you are, it's probably worth a visit.",

Well lit, sumptuous, spacious there was plenty of room for everyone without feeling you are stepping on each other. One of the highlights of my trip!",
          "The palace stands and looks sublime. It has  royal reception rooms, kitchen and ruins under it. The stable is also looks good but pales in comparison to some others. There is also the parliament and theatres. The one  point deducted is due the same reason as with other buildings in Copenhagen, i.e. ticket price is high.",

          "In the ruins: Fantastic telling of the castle's history, with miniature editions of the former castles and great stories of how Copenhagen became. In the castle: great look into what a modern constitutional monarchy looks like. You can easily spend most of your day here.",
          "Located near the canal System and next to Thorvaldsens Museum, Christiansborg was impossible for us to miss.

          "Beautiful, a good history of the family.  Amazing rooms and grandeur!",
          "The palace is amazing. Make sure you visit the queen's residence. The stables were disappointing as there was no horse. Only carriages. The kitchen was nice but nothing interesting. The ruins or underground was average too but the history was explained nicely. Only the queen's residence is a must if you are short of time",
          "Amazing .even our queen cant dream of such a palace.",

          "A  former palace which house the Danish Parliament. It is a very relaxed area, without the oppressive security often associated with official buildings (such as in London).

          "Truly beautiful, immaculate in every way. A must  see palace for every visitor to Copenhagen. The carpet style tapestries and the fairytale library (looks like it came straight out of a Beauty and the Beast film) make it worth the entrance price itself",

        "wiki": "Rosenborg Castle (Danish: Rosenborg Slot) is a renaissance castle located in Copenhagen, Denmark. The castle was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 and is an example of Christian IV's many architectural projects. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style, typical of Danish buildings during this period, and has been expanded several times, finally evolving into its present condition by the year 1624. Architects Bertel Lange and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger are associated with the structural planning of the castle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle was used by Danish regents as a royal residence until around 1710. After the reign of Frederik IV, Rosenborg was used as a royal residence only twice, and both these times were during emergencies. The first time was after Christiansborg Palace burned down in 1794, and the second time was during the British attack on Copenhagen in 1801.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Long Hall ===\n\nLocated on the third floor, the Long Hall was completed in 1624. It was originally intended as a ballroom. Around 1700 it was used as Royal Reception Room and for banquets. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that it became known as the \"Knight's Hall\".\nChristian V had the hall partly modernised with twelve tapestries depicting the King's victories in the Scanian War (1675\u20131679). The stucco ceiling seen today is from the beginning of the 18th century. It shows the Danish Coat of Arms surrounded by the Orders of the Elephant and of Dannebrog. Side reliefs depict historical events from the first years of the reign of Frederik IV, including the liberation of the serfs, the founding of the dragoons and of the land militia among them. The frescos in the ceiling by Hendrick Krock, represent the Regalia.\nAmong the main attractions of Rosenborg are the coronation chair of the absolutist kings and the throne of the queens with the three silver lions standing in front. The Long Hall also contains a large collection of silver furniture, of which most is from the 17th century.\n\n\n== Rosenborg Collections ==\nThe castle is open to the public for tours and houses a museum exhibiting the Royal Collections, artifacts spanning a breadth of royal Danish culture, from the late 16th century of Christian IV to the 19th century. Some of these articles once belonged to the nobility and the aristocracy. The castle, now state property, was opened to the public in 1838.\nOf special interest to tourists is a treasury displaying the Crown Jewels and the Danish Crown Regalia located in the castle. A Coronation Carpet is also stored there. The Throne Chair of Denmark is located in the castle. In the summer time, flowers bloom in front of the castle in the castle garden.\n\n\n== Gardens ==\nThe castle is situated in Kongens Have (\"The King's Garden\"), also known as \"Rosenborg Castle Garden\". The Rosenborg Castle Garden is the country's oldest royal garden and was embellished in the Renaissance style by Christian IV shortly before the construction of the main castle. Today, the gardens are a popular retreat for the people of Copenhagen, and attract an estimated 2.5 million visitors every year. Next to the castle are barracks where the Royal Life Guards is garrisoned. The Life Guard guards the castle.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles and palaces in Denmark\nTourism in Denmark\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Rosenborg Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nCopenhagen-Portal - Rosenborg Castle and History\nOfficial site\nThe Association of Castles and Museums around the Baltic Sea",

          "The Crown Jewels are very well presented and you get very close to them. There are a lot of very intricate pieces of sculpture, art, old guns, chess sets, thrones, plates, glassware, clocks and so on; and especially in the treasury these were very beautiful and interesting. In",

          "I make it a point to visit every castle and palace open to the public during my travels. Rosenborg Castle may have the most magnificently furnished and authentically appointed interiors of any I have ever visited. Makes you feel as if you are there for a party with the KIng 400",

          "This was an amazing look back into history. The castle reminds me of something I would see in a movie. The hall on the top floor, the weaponry, the jewels, the tapestries, and the paintings took me back to a time of Medieval and Gothic elegance. There are winding stairs to the",

          "Visited this place fish thing in the morning straight after opening it's a little busy as everyone tries to go to the ticket office then use the lockers provided for storage as well. I would recommend visiting at about 11am in the morning as the morning rush would be gone by",
          "We have visited quite a few palaces- and this one is maybe the nicest we have seen. It is a very nice building with very nice gardens. The museum inside is breathtaking, leading you throughout all the furnished rooms used by the Danish Kings, Queens & families, and the icing on",
          "Inspect crown jewels, jewelry, ivory collections, and clocks. This was a quaint castle, but worth the walk through. Finally, on the top floor, make sure you find the glassware. Yes. Plates and glasses. Venetian glass work of the time makes this worth the visit by itself.",
          "It was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 for King Christian IV. It's beautiful inside and having a tour guide made the visit extra special.",
          "Well preserved royal castle with lots of interesting exhibits ( includes the original 17th century King\u2019s toilet). Audio guide available and excellent on line guide goes room by room with barcodes on some items. If you like castles and stately homes this is one of the best.",
          "The grounds are fabulous. The king's garden is sprawling and breathtaking. The queen's garden is a little sanctuary full of wonderful rose smells. We loved it! Very romantic!",
          "We toured the castle while in Copenhagen. The grounds are nice. The castle has many rooms with all kinds of artifacts from the past 500 years or so including weapons, jewelry, carvings, artwork, and a bunch of eclectic items like a mirrored room, a handmade music box, and a",
          "This a lovely castle and the collection that it holds gives one a good insight of a royal life. Naturally, the royals led/lead a very opulent life, but it\u2019s not over the top compared to some of their past European counterparts. The grounds of the castle are lovely and I feel",
          "Within easy walking distance of Stroget, Rosenborg provides a look at Danish royal life. Wonderful architecture with interesting artifacts within. So glad we had a chance to tour here.",
          "One of the best collection of royals in this castle. Pick up the brochure as you enter which gives the details of all the rooms and it is done in an orderly fashion. The treasure is in the next building basement. You are given a timed ticket which allows you to enter with few",
          "You can't miss this castle! Beautiful gardens and buildings (inside and out) with the crown jewels included in the tour.",
          "You will get so much more information and the extra fee isn't a lot. We booked online and met our guide Louisa. There were only 2 others and they were busy taking pictures so we had the guide pretty much to ourselves. She was a font of information (history major) and gave us",
          "I did a self guided tour of this castle. There was very little available for information. The maps we received at the ticket counter did little more than to label the rooms and their locations. I did not have much idea of what any of the items were or significance of the",
          "We would highly recommend you see Rosenborg Castle. It\u2019s an incredible place with beautiful original Danish artifacts that must be seen. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Beautifully maintained tranquil grounds, which are perfect for a stroll regardless of the weather! Worth taking the time out to visit.",
          "Loved seeing all of Rosenborg Castle. You can tour the interior which is well maintained. The top floor with the large ballroom and tapestries is especially nice. The Danish crown jewels are in the treasury in the basement of the castle. The grounds themselves are lovely and",
          "The gardens are quite vast (being in the centre of a capital), laid out beautifully and the castle with it. Not to miss.",
          "Wonderful and well maintained Castle. Perfect organisation typical of Danish people. Bravo! Only remarks the Treasure room so small, tiny and dark . That's a pity for an heritage like this.",
          "Better than the royal palace...! Well preserved with an amazing atmosphere. Surely worth a visit. The gardens around are amazing, too.",
          "A two minute walk from our hotel, so we visited a couple times. Didn't do the interior tour but admired many times from the surrounding green space and gardens. Very nice!",
          "I found this to be a small historic Palace rather than a castle, beautiful exterior with splendid interior, don\u2019t forget to take the information leaflet at the entrance, you can read about the different parts of the palace while walking through, I loved the marvelous cupboards",
          "Great castle surrounded by garden, nice collection of artifacts related to Dutch royals. Castle policy requires checking bags and other personal items, so come 15 min prior to reserve a locker",
          "We spent 2 hours at the castle and grounds. It was amazing. We had the fortune of seeing the changing of the guards and the associated ceremony. The grounds are immaculate and the shrubbery designs in the gardens are unlike anything I've seen before. Embedded within each",
          "One of the best I've ever seen. True treasures.Nice well kept castle in a neat and organised garden, full of flowers. If you have limited time in Copenhagen keep this one on the shortlist.",
          "Beautiful small palace. Stroll through the park, relax outside, then it is somehow bigger inside than you would estimate when walking around it. True gems, surprising architectural extras, conserved with eye for detail. Breathing history. Highlights: the large hall with the",
          "This was a very historic castle. The grounds are beautiful and the inside very interesting. Do not miss the jewels in the basement. It adds a little to the ticket price and is optional. My advice go for it. When are you going to have that opportunity again?",
          "Three floors of antique furniture and objects, such as glassware, China, paintings, etc. If not for the provenance I doubt whether an estate sale would generate much interest. BUT then, you enter the basement and the Royal Treasury. Here is where you will find items that are",
          "Period furniture, art, ivory, amber & glass work is outstanding. Crown jewels also. Grounds are beautiful too. Would recommend spending a.whole day here.",
          "While enjoying our second stay in Copenhagen, we again visited the Rosenborg Castle. The castle is located in the central part of the city but it is surrounded by the botanical gardens and other parks. Because of its location, the castle is easily accessed by public transport",
          "Very nice place, the castle is huge and you are walking in group's, worth to see. Around the castle is a huge park and its completely free, so if you wana skip the case you can still enjoying outside and take a great photos. You need to leave your stuff in locker, so do not",
          "Very quaint, little castle with 3 different sections to it. Loved seeing the Crown Jewels and all the Ivory work from the queen and princess\u2019 lathe. We used our Copenhagen Card to get in here for free.",
          "A place in the trip that should not be missed. Gardens all around and the tour of the museum is really great and detailed. The crown jewels on display is something that u don't see often.a place to spend your afternoon and relax.",
          "My wife and I visited Rosenborg Castle, partly because admission was covered by our Copenhagen Card and partly because it is so close to a couple of other museums we were interested in. It was also a stop for our Hop Off/Hop On bus. We waited for the time on our ticked, then",
          "We were on a cruise ship but decided to visit the Castle on our own. Very glad that we did. The castle is easy to find and there was not a long line to enter. They sell timed entries on the internet if you know what time you will arrive. Otherwise you can just show up and",
          "We bought tickets and were given a time to enter (about 45 minutes wait). The floors are not handicap accessible. The sequential movement made it easy to go from room to room. But, there was not enough information to read and understand. It is hard to download an app for",
          "Nice castle! Were there in the summer morning, and it was great! you of course must to see this nice place!",
          "When checking the entry times, look at the castle website and not at a guide book. The DK guide book to Copenhagen says the castle is open until 6 in the summer months (including August), however this is incorrect, the castle was only open until 5 when I went (on 14 August).",
          "One of the smaller castles around Denmark, but right downtown Copenhagen. You can easily spend the same amount of time inside the castle and outside in the park and gardens. Any traveler should at least take a walk in the park.",
          "The gardens are just beautiful and perfect for a relaxing stroll, I\u2019d recommend a visit. We never went into the castle but the building itself was beautiful too.",
          "Quite a nice castle, very well preserved and filled with all kinds of things from the mundane to the opulent. I wouldn't say it's a big castle but there are a lot of things to see and learn there, great place if you want to get to know more about Denmark's history. Right next to",
          "Rosenborg Castle itself is an amazing sight with great architecture and beautiful gardens. The royal rooms inside had great art and interesting artefacts. It is full of history with good information along the way. The best part was seeing the Crown Jewels. Would highly recommend",
          "Not only is this castle well maintained, it has am amazing collection of items from its time - everything used for meals, swords, crown jewels, armor, guns, art of all sorts, clothing... One of my favorite parts were actually the amazing ceilings from room to room. Great way to",
          "For me was the best historical objective in Copenhagen...It,s like a castle from a fairy tale. It is surrounding by a very nice park.",
          "Recommend buying your tickets online. The queue can be quite long once you get there. There is a tour guide website you can use but our internet connection is slow and it used a lot of battery on your phone. We were in time for the guided tour but our entry time wouldn\u2019t let us",
          "A huge castle and good for a snap or two. Marvel the structure and architecture. The gardens are well maintained.",
          "We got here at 3.45 thinking we had 75 mins to walk around the palace. We got a timed admission for 4.30 which gave us just 25 mins to look round and 5 mins to pick up our possessions from the locker as the staff said they promptly close at 5. Personally I think they should have",
          "I am not a fan of touristy places like this. I struck it at the height of summer; thousands jostling for a look around. However you can appreciate it from various vantage points in the park close by. I don't think there is a need to go in unless you have a special interest.",
          "Interesting castle but a bit tricky to manage with young children. Was very busy when we visited (early afternoon, mid week in summer) which meant we had to wait for about an hour for a slot to enter the main building and treasury in the basement. Very hard to move around with",
          "We spent a lovely afternoon here playing cards and just enjoying the sun. And roses! It was our good luck to make it here while the flowers were in their prime. Beautiful and peaceful right in the city center.",
          "Smaller than the Christiansborg Palace so it can seem crowded as you walk through the various rooms. Very ornate furnishings and lots of old paintings. A lot to see. The grounds are nice to walk around. I would definitely include it on my list of things to see in the city.",
          "A lovely castle with lots to see, soldiers on guard, old living quarters of the Danish royal family and a treasury with some of the royal jewels. Lovely gardens.",
          "This small fairytale-like castle in Copenhagen is well worth a visit as it is more intimate than many larger and grander castles in Europe. This castle, built in the early 1600's, was the favorite of Christian IV who died here. There is even a showcase with his clothing from a",
          "You\u2019ll need at least two to three hours to explore the castle and extensive grounds. Gardens are well worth the visit.",
          "The Copenhagen Card will get you in for \u201cfree.\u201d Even if you have to pay, visiting this Castle is well worth the price. We walked from Nyhaven and came through the gates to see the beauty of Rosenborg Gardens. There is good reason why over 2 million people visit here. The",
          "You can see the exquisite fine collection from the past.... small palace yet mesmerizes you with its collections. Dont forget to visit the basement. Easily accessible via metro. We had no wait nor long lines. We had taken the CPH pass for 48 hours which was very useful.",
          "You can see rooms on five floors, including two basement levels (one for the treasury and the other for wine and weapons). There are many beautiful and unique items, but we were particularly impressed with the 3-D ceiling decorations and intricate ivory carvings.",
          "Me and husband had a stop off on our cruise at Copenhagen, so we decided to go around Rosenberg Castle. We had around a 40 min wait to get in which was fine, we explored the lovely gardens and managed to catch the changing of the guard! Any bags that cannot fit into their box",
          "Timed entrance keeps the crowd reasonable. Start at Ground level, the 2nd living level,on up to the throne room on the 3rd level, then the treasury in the basement. The personal bathroom, trick chair, the queen's nude picture on the ceiling. The King's throne of narwhal",
          "We had to wait a short time to enter the castle so enjoyed a stroll around the garden before going in. The castle contains a lot of interesting portraits, paintings, tapestries and other antiquities which bring to life the periods of the castles occupation by the Danish Royal",
          "This is a very interesting castle as it is still original, compared to Christiansborg, which burned a few times. The visit is in two parts. First, you visit some of the rooms in the castle. Some are rather nice, while some are dark and not offering so much interest. But",
          "Rosenborg Slot may is not the largest castle in the city, but it is certainly the most beautiful! Its architecture is reminicent of the dutch houses in Amsterdam, but more ornate and elegant. The setting couldnt be better, the gardens sorrounding the castle are also beautiful",
          "Booked the tickets online before we went to save some time. This was simply to do, sent email with tickets straight away and had no trouble using them. You can pay for a guide but we did not. You can pick up a nice paper leaflet with the castle layout when you are there. You",
          "Very interesting visit, a jump in the history. And ones of the most beautiful crown jewels. Plus the castle itself in a scenic surrounding, full of romanticism.",
          "Another creation of the king. He had lots of places to be comfortable. Most of my tours were outside these exquisite buildings but they spoke a lot of their former king.",
          "Free withCopenhagen Card, but you still need to queue to convert it into a ticket and wait the entrance time slot. Allow an extra 30min to the visit for that. It tajes about 1hr30/2hrs for the Palace plus the garden on top. Combine with Kunst Museum nearby and botanical Gardens",
          "The Rosenburg Castle is located in central Copenhagen with an interesting history and the Danish Royal Jewels. We booked the English language tour on-line that meant that we jumped the queues and had a very informative tour guide for 45DKK each.",
          "Such and interesting and beautiful \"castle\". They recommend one hour, entrance it timed but I would say take your time and stay at least two so that you can really appreciate the beauty of the castle. the grounds are free to enter and are beautifully kept.",
          "We visited late July on a weekday; arrived at around 1100 am and were assigned an entry time an hour and 20 minutes later. So, hot tip, if you want to maximize your time, buy a ticket online and pick a time. It turns out, this a big tourist bust site, with loads of people",
          "The castle is fairly typical except for the crown jewels. They are very special and interesting. Would have liked to explore the gardens but the tour was moving on to another place. Individuals visitors without reservations were having a long wait.",
          "Very rich interior resembles a bit crazy Neuschwanstein. If you like this style the place is for you. Veery interesting plasters and paintings on ceilings.",
          "We toured this castle museum with Richard Karpen (separate review). It\u2019s a great way to learn more about Danish history. The Crown Jewels are beautiful. Lots of interesting rooms and displays.",
          "Very interesting, the gardens are very peaceful and popular with the locals in nice weather. When you visit here, don\u2019t miss the Crown Jewels.",
          "I stumbled across Rosenberg Castle and Gardens after an afternoon spent wandering in the botanics (they\u2019re pretty much down the road from one another so good sites to combine into a day trip if you get there early!). The grounds are very picturesque to great for taking some",
          "What a great place to visit. You can begin by walking through the King's Garden and snapping some wonderful photos of flowers you've probably never seen before. While wandering about, we came across a rehearsal of an unusually presented piece of theatre but were not there to",
          "I visited the castle in July as solo. You can purchase the entrance ticket and need to put your bag in the locker for security reasons. The castle seems not too big but inside has several floors including downstairs to see and lots of art works. Can take photos and can be",

          "This is a must see - from the gardens to the grounds to the stuuning Crown Jewals this place was amazing!",
          "Wonderful Palace which houses the Danish Crown Jewels with lovely gardens to walk around. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Just looked from the outside. Nice garden and great park. Dead ducks in the pond was a special sight. Floating feet up along with big carp-fish. Had a glimpse off army musicians training close by.",
          "Really impressive, and worth visiting. The paintings, marble work and artifacts centuries old were great viewing. Try to go when there aren\u2019t multiple tour groups, otherwise, moving among rooms and areas of interest is more like you are in a hurd of cattle!",
          "A must see attraction while visiting Copenhagen. Beautiful gardens surround a former Royal Residence. Each room decorated with family treasures, art and furniture. Throne room impressive. Highlight is the trip into the vault to see the Royal treasures,from crowns to weapons, to",
          "This is the one former Royal Palace that really is worth spending time going through slowly,. Used by the Royal Family until about 1710 it is now the place where all of the royal jewels are stored and showcased in the \"basement.\" The upper floors are filled with portraits,",
          "Stunning castle and didn\u2019t actually book to visit this until we got to Copenhagen. Worth several hours here possibly 4 to get a good view of castle. Check online but they also do changing of the guard around 12 and they march over to another area. Soldiers on guard outside who",
          "As royal palaces go, Rosenborg Castle is quite small. But the exhibits on display are beautiful, intriguing and very interesting. So a visit is very much recommended. To avoid being overwhelmed by crowds the tickets are sold with a designated entry time. If you miss your slot",
          "We arranged for a small group tour through the castle website. A few in our group were late getting there (taxi got lost- unbelievable!), and they waited for us, helped our older folks manage. The stories made the history come alive. Excellent tour guide (wish I could remember",

          "One of the best I've ever seen. True treasures. If you have limited time in Copenhagen keep this one on the shortlist. Be prepared for hordes of Asian tourists and try to go off hours.",
          "My wife and I visited the Palace during our stay in Copenhagen. The Palace itself is in a beautiful garden setting. The cost was 115K/person. There is a wonderful collection of items to see in the Palace, including the crown jewels. The solid silver lions are also incredible. We",

          "We had a beautiful, sunny day to visit and loved the gardens. In the future we would probably take a picnic lunch to enjoy in he gardens. The Castle is very pretty too. Small restaurant on the premises has very limited menu, but is an option (with all outdoor seating) if you",

          "Really enjoyed touring this castle and beautiful grounds. The ceilings in some of the rooms were outstanding and the floors were as well. Definitely these crafts are lost arts. Loved seeing all the people using the grounds for leisurely enjoying the day. Highly recommend touring",

          "You need time to really enjoy this castle as there is so much to see.If you are a history buff the artifacts on diplay are excellent. The grounds are so well planned for you to stroll and if you bring a sandwich for lunch you can stay several hours just visiting this place. it",

          "The grounds are lovely. The crown jewels are lovely. The museum is ok. If you go enjoy a nice walk around the gardens.",
          "Many interesting things to see here and worth the time. The best part is the Crown Jewels. You go in to the basement for those, but they do offer shorter people the option of getting on small platforms raised several steps up for a better view.",
          "The Rosenborg Castle, garden and Treasury are some of the best historical sites in Copenhagen. You will need a ticket or the Copenhagen Card to get in. Entries are timed but not guided. This helps keep crowding to a minimum. You can tour it on your own speed. There is a nice",

          "Our visit was spoiled a bit as we visited the Royal Castles in St. Petersburg a few months ago. It's a shame because Rosenborg was still beautiful - just not by comparison. The gardens are exquisite and worth the walk through.",
          "The beautiful 400-year-old castle is situated in central Copenhagen's popular park, The King's Garden. The castle was built by one of the most famous Scandinavian kings, Christian IV. Today, the glory of the past ...",
          "This is definitely worth 1-2 hours. We loved walking through the rooms and seeing the artifacts and building.",
          "The Rosenborg gardens are nice to wander or relax in. The castle is good to visit to learn more about the history of the Danish royal family, including the crown jewels.",
          "What I liked best was the architecture of the castle, the park and the rose garden. I did not visit the castle from the inside, but it is worth visiting this spot. A stroll along the tree-lined avenue and a nap in the park are very relaxing.",
          "Second visit before was in winter this time in summer/spring gardens are absolutely great and the palace quite brilliant and you get up close to the Danish Crown Jewels a must see in Copenhagen",
          "The castle and gardens are the most beautiful place to visit. There are lots of areas to sit and people watch or to enjoy the gardens. I love flowers so I spent a lot of time just strolling through them. It was a gorgeous day and the park was full of family and friends",
          "If you only take a stroll through the grounds of both you\u2019re rewarded. I\u2019ve seen enough jewels so passed on the contents. We enjoyed walking the Botanical grounds and had a peek into the butterfly room. Charming park!",
          "A centrally located city park, ideal just to stroll through with the Rosenborg castle as an extra too !",
          "Great castle to visit. Lots to see. Staff are very knowledgeable and more than happy to answer any questions you have. Amazing to see how well preserved the art, furniture and flooring is.",
          "Lots to take in and see but it is very dark inside so maybe worth bringing a torch! It wasn't busy when I visited so not sure how crowded it might get, particularly on the stairways.",
          "4th castle we visited in Denmark -- it's not as fancy as Fredricksburg but very beautiful and interesting in it's own right. and it has the royal jewels",
          "Very bad experience. As a Copenhagen cardholder, you have to sit in long line. The line is very slow as there are a lot of discussions on baggage at the desk, this should happen before. They ask even that medium purse goes to locker, lockers are not optimal and you need a coin",
          "Excellent lay out per floor, you can't come closer to everyday life in a royal family. Interesting to see the adaptations made by various generations and their hobbies. To top it off - the national treasury in the basement. Wow.... As a bonus a magnificent park and gardens",
          "I've heard the wait can be long, which isn't worth it. We had only about 10 minutes and that was fine. Grounds and gardens are the best part (and those are free). Castle itself is just a mishmosh of random pieces in rooms. No guide. Rooms themselves are only ok. The grand throne",
          "We tried to move to the basement and the Crown Jewels after a quick look round one floor of the palace proper, but the guard would have npone pof it. So we went back up and looked round the other two floors and then went to the Treasury. A mini Versailles in style and",
          "This is a beautiful castle built by King Christian IV for his young bride. He loved being in residence here and it quickly became his favorite castle and venue for many important events. The gardens are beautiful as well, especially during rose season.",
          "Great history. Beautiful grounds. This should be a stop on your tour of Copenhagen. We probably spent an hour to an hour and a half at this site including walking around the gardens. We had the Copenhagen Card so our entrance fee was covered. We arrived at 10:10am and the",
          "A beautiful palace set in wonderful grounds. However, most of the items on display are not labelled sufficiently.",
          "The castle and the gardens are beautiful. It is a perfect place to spend an afternoon. I especially enjoyed the beautiful floral displays in the garden.",
          "Rosenborg is a nice little (by comparison) castle that has several well preserved rooms that captures the look and feel of eras past. Jewel and gold collection is nice as well, and the park outside is lovely. Interesting comparison with other castles / palaces which are dated",
          "We didn't go inside the castle, but the gardens are beautiful and a great place for a picnic and to people watch, especially on a sunny day.",
          "I didn't go inside, but from the outside it's nice to see. It's near botanical garden, so you can see both sights at once.",
          "In the castle the light was very bad, it was hard to see the pictures. For me the big room with lions and big tapestries was the most impressive. The meticulous elaboration of tapestries is amazing. How much time did it take! Big carps were waiting for the food on the canal of",
          "Small castle but well worth to take the time visit. Beautiful gardens at the rear of the castle including a duck pond.",
          "Queue was pretty big so it's worth booking a time slot online if you can. We had to buy tickets, go away and come back. They stagger entry quite well so you're not jostling with too many people in the rooms. Lots of interesting artefacts to look at. I think 90 minutes is plenty",
          "Rosenborg Castle is an absolute must for anyone visiting Copenhagen. A truly historic landmark and somewhere that you gain valuable insight into the Danish Royal family and the lives they lived. The castle was very busy on the Saturday that we visited, so much so that we had to",
          "We visited this site on a cloudy rainy day. They won\u2019t allow you to bring umbrellas or bags into the castle, so we were a bit soaked when we were able to get our belongings out of the locker. The castle is elaborately decorated in tapestries, paintings, sculptures, and even",
          "There were many beautiful objects to see but because of the gloomy day it was too dark to view them. The rooms are not well lit, so if you went on a bright day it might be easier to see. Couple that with the challenging online guide it made for a frustrating experience.",
          "If you're into architecture and history, it's a must go. I personally am not that interested and still liked it.",
          "My first attempt at visiting Rosenborg didn't go well: I arrived at 2pm, and after queuing for 15 minutes discovered that the next admission would be in an hour, but that they closed at 4pm, leaving hardly any time to look around. I decided to try again the following morning. I",
          "Rosenborg Castle is a must see. The park, the structure and its contents are worth exploring. Do book ahead (entry is timed) and plan to store your bags (not enough lockers on a busy day). There are four floors to explore and there is much displayed in very ornate rooms. The",
          "The guide books suggest 1-2 hours for the visit we took nearer three there was so much to see. Three floors of rooms, full of portraits, paintings, furniture, clocks and other curiosities not to forget the interiors. From the Kings loo, to the chair that watered the guests, to",
          "I gave a review on this before but it is good it is not included here so I give it again. This was a place for the kings and queens from the past and is very old and regal",
          "I arrived today anxious to tour the castle using my Copenhagen card. Upon checking in I discovered I had to place my small bag in a locker. Yet my bag was no bigger than many of the ladies purses. When I asked why the discrepancy, I was told to ask someone else. Clearly no",
          "Lovely castle, fab grounds. Very interesting inside especially the Crown Jewels and treasury. Time ticket when busy but that wasn\u2019t a problem, spaced out the visitors in what us quite a small castle. Very enjoyable.",
          "We toured the Castle with a guided tour and that made it very enjoyable. He did an excellent job of explaining all the history. I enjoyed the crown jewels. Very interesting tour!",
          "I loved this palace because of the man in the top hat whose guided tour I jumped on at the last moment. He\u2019s simply hilarious but also highly knowledgeable; the tour made the visit entirely worthwhile. A beautiful spot that I highly recommend but one that is made much more",
          "Interesting but very dark in many parts of the Castle. The jewels were amazing and the building fascinating.",
          "Rosenberg Castle is well worth a visit while you are in Copenhagen. Located in very attractive grounds (now public parkland), the Castle is relatively small compared to others in Europe. The ticket office is easily located and there is a cloak room for bags, etc. Danish Army",
          "We had a visit to this castle at the end of one of our tours and it was a lovely place for some photo snaps. Very well kept gardens, a little tearoom, lockers, a small souvenir shop and bathrooms, although they were not the cleanest I\u2019m afraid - maybe too many tours! Enjoyed",
          "Our last day in Europe was spent in Copenhagen, killing time before heading to the airport for our flight back to the states. We decided to check out Rosenborg Castle to put a lid on our castle visits for the week. The line to purchase entry tickets was quite long but seemed to",
          "Another castle worth visiting if castles are your thing. This castle is included within the Copenhagen Card. One perk here is the visit to the treasury in the basement and sub-basement of the castle. Includes the crowns, jewellery, and armoury among other things. The gardens",
          "I was happy we made the stop here as we did not make it to Fredericksborg and made a quick pass through Christiansborg. A local told us this was the best and I believe they were right. He castle itself is quite small but had four levels including the basement. Plenty of items",
          "I was spell bound despite not being big fan of castle and museums .very well documented and wasy to follow . All floors capture life of monarchy well. They have website which you van open on phone and with free wifi you can follow and know about each and every detail . Treasury",
          "It\u2019s a great place to relax and enjoy the nature The garden is amazing You can have a nice picnic enjoying the sun",
          "Loved the gardens, the lake, the trees, the atmosphere, just such a lovely place to be! The sun was out, but kids had a blast",
          "The place has a palace and the royal gardens. It means that they take really good care of the plants and flowers. You can have a nice (and expensive) coffee at a Cafe in the middle of the park, and even take your kids to play at the playground.",
          "This is very much worth seeing but be aware you have to queue to get a ticket (if if you have a Copenhagen card) and then wait a while longer until it is your allocated time to visit (visiting times are staggered). It's poosible to save a bit of time by buying the tickets online",
          "We were pleasantly surprised with this place. The museum is well organized and there are so much stuff to see! We were surprised to see how preserved the artifacts and castle are. And don\u2019t forget to visit the basement to see the jewels. Spectacular!",
          "The castle itself is decent for the cost. But not worth a line wait. Whats better is the park around it, on a sunny day. Stroll & Nap here!",
          "Rosenberg castle is a beautiful building inside and out. Inside are very regal rooms full of treasures, tapestries and trinkets from the past. There is also a treasury underneath the building where crowns and expensive jewels are stored. We spent around 2 hours there. We had",
          "On a cold bank holiday in Copenhagen this was always going to be busy. Entrance to castle was on a timed ticket and the door keeper was quite forceful on that matter! We had read that there was little info inside in English - but there was little info in any language. Although",
          "It's a lovely castle, quite small but full of character. Very close to city centre by walking. We did have a half hour queue at least to get tickets",
          "Brought tickets in advance, as you sometimes have to wait for entry as they only let so many people in at a time, you cannot take bags into the castle, there is a locker room. Took about an hour to go round, then spent some time in the lovely gardens. Lots of rooms and old bits",
          "We stopped at this on the hop on hop off bus tour. Well worth the stop. You had to wear surgical scrub booties over your shoes which was a new one for me. The tapestry room was just incredible.",
          "Save time by booking tickets in advance. We waited 30 minutes for the ticket window, then another 45 minutes for our assigned entry time. Booking in advance would have eliminated most of this waiting. Still, the Rosenborg was worth thhe wait - Dont miss the Royal Jewels in the",
          "Went to this castle and it was magnificent, overload of information and so much to see. Spent over an hour going through.",
          "We had arrived at the booking office but were told we could only go in at certain times as they only let in a number of people in one go. We got told that we would have to wait 1hr 40 mins for the next slot. We decided to book one for later on at 2:30pm so as to not waste time.",
          "A beautiful castle with a royal collection of jewelry that takes your breath away. The piece that I liked the most is the ring that the king gave the queen after he found out she was cheating on him. And with this sentence that was the inscription I leave you to explore the",
          "booked on line and saved a considerable amount of time waiting in line to buy tickets. Beautifully kept gardens to wonder around before entering the castle. Castle its self was very interesting but felt head set would have been useful to fully understand all the items on",
          "This castle is beautiful on the outside and inside. The size is not so large where you feel overwhelmed and uninterested at the end. I would recommend to get tickets in advance to avoid the long wait! Also leverage the QR code reader for some of the fun facts.",
          "we almost missed seeing the Rosenborg Castle and glad we did not. a quick tour of the serveral floors in the Castle and Church; followed by a viewing of the Royal collection of priceless gems, crowns, ivory carvings, etc. were worth the short time spent getting there.",
          "Surprising discovery in the centre of Copenhage. This castle was Christian IV favorite residence, and its rooms are decorated with many eccentric objects. The throne room is simply astonishing. The Crown Jewels are also kept here.",
          "Great historical site in the center of the city. It was included in our Copenhagen card, and we toured all 3 floors and the basements as well. Took about an hour to get through and we enjoyed all of it.",
          "Paid to go inside and downstairs mainly to see the Crown Jewels. It was beautiful inside but the outside views were more breathtaking. Do NOT walk near the guards they will yell at you to get out of their way I was there with my 2 young boys and he scared one of them when we",
          "Very pleasant. They control the crowds and that made it very enjoyable. The basement was the best part.",

          "I purchased a Copenhagen City Card which includes free entry into the Rosenborg Castle. This castle is smaller than those you typically see, but well worth the visit as well as the park surrounding it. I rented a electric-assist bicycle that had a GPS map system on it and",
          "Rosenberg Castle sits in the Kings Garden, which is a beautiful, large park. The castle itself starts with a tour of the upper two floors of living space with period furniture and decorations. The three silver lions in front of two royal chairs are amazing. Then you visit the",

          "The castle is free for who is under 18 years old which means that there are a lot of people. It is really nice place, what i liked most was the floor in which there were the rings and the crown. The castle has a lor of history inside but it is not interactive but stil anyway si",
          "We went here on our friend's recommendation and because of the Copenhagen Card. It was a spectacular palace, and it was great to see the Danish crown jewels. Worth a visit if you have the Copenhagen Card, or if you can get some sort of group discount (I saw there were some for",
          "such a thing. Relatively young for a castle it was ornate but nothing like the French, British, etc castles. It definitely had a more homey feel and I guess that fits with the Danish persona/lifestyle. The gardens were well manicured and lovely despite the time of year we",

          "Entrance is about \u00a313. Well worth visiting, built in 17th century, where the Dutch Royal Family lived. Down in the basement is where the Royal jewels are kept. Fabulous.",
          "Nothing really new here. Here is where the King and Queen slept, ate, entertained and went to the bathroom. Crown Jewels were impressive. It is a residence rather than a fortress. The gardens are nice.",

          "Not what we would traditionally consider a castle or palace, but well laid out and a fascinating insight into the lifestyle of Danish royalty in the 17th century. The highlight has to be the Crown Jewels in the James Bond-worthy bunker underneath. Well worth the modest cost and",
          "There were big queues for going in and it was quite slow to get in. Only small bags allowed others must be placed in lockers which cost 20 danish krone. Staff were friendly and answered any questions. The gardens are really impressive, the castle is worth a visit. I preferred",

          "Set at the edge of a park, the castle is definitely worth visiting while you wander around Copenhagen exploring the city. It's not like a medieval fortress, more like a stately manor, with interesting corridors and rooms to explore. Afterwards you can sit in the park and watch",
          "Great place to wander, rooms in a variety of colour, light or shade (dark) and interesting exhibits. All of which is very thought provoking, as are the Crown Jewels.",
          "This is one of our favorite castles to visit. It is not grandiose and overwhelming. Instead it is rather cosy and homey bringing the quality of everyday people to royalty. Christian IV's winter room and writing cabinets are particular favorites. There are also lovely gardens",

          "Stunning castle and grounds in the centre of Copenhagen. Stunning rooms, artifacts, paintings and surroundings. The crown jewels are stunning, not as many as on display in the Tower of London for example, but i do love shiney things. Well worth the entrance fee - opening",

          "It is not a very huge castle, but the decoration, furniture and the arts look pretty and bring out the royal luxurious ambience. The winding stair with many flower paintings is a rustic remark. If you don\u2019t have time or don\u2019t want to spend 110 DKK to get inside, walking in",
          "There are bigger and more luxurious Castles in Europe, however this one is more original and has a 'better feeling' than any of the others around Europe. Well worth going to see, we've been back a few times.",
          "This castle is quiet small, but set in gardens. Its 115dkk to get in and has 3 floors inside and 2 basements. Its not got much of a wow factor or grand charm. However if you have time in Copenhagen i\u2019d say visit.",
          "We love king Christian IV, who lost half the kingdom, but built half of Copenhagen. This small castle was his retreat, where he partyed with the best and the brightest of the realm. Also heavely guarded crown jewels.",
          "First of all, the opening hours of Rosenborg Castle are very short so if you want to go, make sure you go early. However, I do not think it is worth it. We only went because we had a Copenhagen Card and all I can say is I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t pay for entry! The inside of the castle",

          "The grounds of Rosenborg Slot are quite picturesque and worth a visit even if you do not go inside the castle. The opening hours when we were there were quite short, and that unfortunately made for a very rushed visit. I would not say that the interior tour is a \"must do\" but",
          "Nice gardens, fascinating treasures, so many rooms to see and so many things to admire. I loved the big throne room. We even danced with my daughter to feel how royals amused themselves the old days. Be there early as there are many visitors and it is open only for 5 hours a day.",

          "Very nice castle, i would recommend visiting. The castle and it's garden are a nice example of how royal's (used to) live. Troughout there are castle various QR-codes and item numbers which u can scan or google for more information about the object or room. The treasure room is",

          "An excellent castle with excellent gardens. The exhibitions are well worth the small wait you might have, as your ticket comes with an allocated time to slot to enter the castle and see the floors. Get there early enough and you'll see the royal guards begin their march to Amalienborg.",
          "Very nice place to visit. A must see I would say, if you like history.",
          "Only a train stop from Tivoli gardens, but the feeling that you're worlds away from modern Copenhagen.  This quaint, but ornately adorned castle houses the many collected treasures of King Christian IV.  The treasury also houses the crown jewels of Copenhagen.  Well worth the visit.  A cafe and restrooms on the grounds as well.",

          "I loved this Castle. The Arms prototypes are lovely.",

          "Nice place to walk around and also see the crown jewels.",
          "Castle that hosts Crown Jewels. There are 3 floors of various of old royal halls and small basement with limited collection of crown jewels",
          "One of the highlights of my trip to Europe this year.  The grounds were beautifully manicured and in full bloom.  The castle was magnificent, far better than I expected when looking at the size of it.  The timed ticket system worked very well, as I never felt over crowded or rushed.",
          "Lovely seeing the old furniture and buildings",
          "Hugely pretty and historic palace. Definitely double worth the wait for entrance. Top tip: you can book a later entrance if it is full up when you arrive.",

          "Another must visit for the history buffs. There is a lot to see and the decor is gloriously over the top in some rooms. Rosenborg Castle is also the home of the Danish Crown Jewels, which are on public display in the basement.",
          "You'll find yourself in a sheer exhibition of wealth.",
          "I haven't visited the inside of the castle, because you have to wait a very long time to get in (I recommend buying your tickets online) even if you hav your tickets (this is why I don't give a 5 stars rating). However, the gardens are free and opened, they are full of roses, it's quite nice to chill there!",
          "Beautiful castle worth a visit. Interior was stunning and interesting to see. Outside gardens were beautiful. It was worth the visit and would recommend.",

          "Beautiful castle with a large area of green garden!\nSuper cool place for visiting in Copenhagen \nHighly recommended!!!",
          "Small and nice castle. The garden area around it is more worth the visit than the castle itself. Didn't actually go inside, there was a long queue.",
          "Looks good, open and green spaces. Tourist destination where you'll have to go. Also close to many other attractions worth going to (like Nyhavn).",
          "Didn't know what to expect when I went here. I knew nothing about it but would definitely recommend. It's a very grand castle set in a beautiful park. The collection of antiques is amazing, there are lots and lots of very interesting pieces along with some fabulous paintings all set within the excellent castle.",
          "Super experience to visit.  to see the very king and queen story super super story experience.  There is so much to see of history experience.  You see the place you a history experience you will remember and at the same time a beautiful experience.  Remember to use about 3 to 4 to see everything",

          "The Rosenborg Castle is very popular. All the tourists go there. The art and furnishings see every impressive. The throne room is something to see. So it's the bathroom, the other throne room. \nThis place would have rated five stars were out not for the self guiding app. I found it slow to respond and confusing to use.",
          "Stunning castle with beautiful surroundings. Can spend along time just wondering around the grounds of the castle. The castle itself takes you back to the time of the kings of old  and how they lived with there vast wealth. Must visit when in Copenhagen, probably the best attraction.",
          "Very interesting castle. Well worth stopping and seeing.",
          "Beautiful palace where the crown jewels are kept. One on the list to visit while in copenhagen, the history and beautiful art work.",
          "A surprise interior, full of paintings, jewels, tapestries, china, and so on. Really worth seeing. The apparent medium size of the castle belies the richness of its interior",

          "Lovely building and gardens, worth a visit.",
          "Crowded, but really packed with antiques. I would suggest buying tickets online to avoid lines. Don't forget to store your bag in museum shop. Have some spare change for that.\nThe inside of the castle is really awesome: a lot of paintings and relics packed in number of rooms across multiple floors.",
          "This park is absolutely beautiful, even though it was undergoing some construction. However, it\u2019s still a very nice place to walk around with bathrooms and many benches to sit on and relax. Many people were just people watching or reading \u2026",
          "Ivory and amber collection is impressively beautiful",
          "It's a very nice castle to visit, and despite its three floors and two underground levels where the jewels are, it doesn't take much more than an hour to go through it. The jewels are amazing, and the rest of the castle is beautiful too, just not quite as majestic as Buckingham Palace. Photos are permitted, which is great.",
          "Crown jewels and throne room are a must. This guy liked clocks. Add a star if you do too",

          "The castle is nice enough with a few things to see. Wish there was more to read on the exhibits themselves without having to go through the web guide. Also, found one of the soldiers to be very rude when he gestured for us to move out of his way when we were waiting to enter the building.",
          "Beautiful palace. The Crown Jewels are in the basement. You need to keep it down as the room is sound sensitive.",
          "Had a good day exploring the Rosenborg Castle and treasury.  Highly recommend it if you ever come to Copenhagen for a visit.",
          "Lovely historical site where you can see house the Danish royalty lived.   Also the treasury with crown jewels is awesome!",
          "Truly great. Beautiful and the garden is really cool.",
          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Copenhagen from a variety of perspectives including history, architecture, art and jewelry. It is well worth the time to take a look and to contemplate Danish culture and history. Especially the strategic location of Denmark to sea traffic in and out of the Baltic.",
          "My goal was to try and find some genuine Danish memorabilia from the gift shop.  Just my luck that they had reduced prices on some great little gift trinkets.  I also enjoyed the grounds and enjoyed taking photos of the winter scenery. \u2026",

          "Very beautiful  surroundings, park and an ancient castle",
          "When we arrived, the doors were closed and there were a lot of tourists wondering what's happening. If this happens to you, don't be alarmed. \n\nApparently some alarm was triggered, prompting a shut-down and security check. After all, there are all a whole lot of valuables in this castle!",
          "A must see in Copenhagen. Everything that is left of Danish kings of the 16th, 17th and 18th century is brought together in that castle. \n\nSome rooms are really dark, so don't visit on overcast days or close to dawn of twilight.",
          "Nice, but rather a poor park. The castle is little and not spectacular. Large part of it is a protected military area (west of the castle itself). Being in Denmark, you'd rather expect something more attractive.",
          "Front desk staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms are comfortable. Located near attractions and Shoppes.",
          "The palace is full of jewerly, painting, ordinary objects and thrones that belonged to the Royal family, nt to mention Royal's crowns!\nThe pamphlet we were given along with  the tickets was well structured, as it described every single room \u2026",
          "Stunning and glorious \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb worths to spend time",

          "Historical castle and like an adventure. More to follow \ud83e\udd29. Must see for turist that likes juwelery and gold. Take a walk in Kings Garden and see the flowers and rest at a bench or have fun with friends. Nearby a small rose garden.",
          "AMAZING PLACE! Don\u2019t skip this one. The Crown Jewels in the basement were breathtaking. Pictures don\u2019t do them justice. You have to see them.",
          "Great place to visit. Gardens are very pretty. Worth seeing Armoury with the Crown Jewels",
          "One of the few castle in Europe where you see about everything.  The self guided tour is good. Some very interesting bits of history shared.  Go during the week and avoid the crowds.",
          "Impressive! Beatiful garden near castle, also in autumn!",
          "Beautiful castle. Got to view the Crown Jewels, which was Olsen Bandens plan to heist.",
          "Nice place, but still less interesting comparing to some royal castles in the world.",
          "It was lovely to look at from the outside, the Gardens were beautiful. We could not go inside as it was closing time",
          "crown jewels are spectacular and best part",
          "Excellent. Treasury is a very interesting collection.",
          "Small but very pretty palace. With the treasury being the highlight with some incredibly intricate works of ivory on display. Them royals really love a dinner plate tho, there's a astonishingly large collection of plates.",
          "Really liked this castle.  Enjoyed walking through at our own pace.  Although you walk through the doorway do not touch the handle..oops.  Staff was very nice.  Do not forget to go to the basement!  Crown jewellery and weaponry very cool.",

          "Nice visit. Not only old but very beautiful furniture",
          "Old and beautiful castle to visit. Three floors of tapestries, paintings, dishes and many other things are really need to visit in Copenhagen. Just try to come before 11 a.m.as there will be lines to cash desks but they go fast.",
          "Everywhere ard this castle is picturesque shot by cam. Best place for me was a big salon where there is throne chair. From there, you can see the best side view of castle garden via window.",
          "The Crown jewels were the highlight. The changing of the guard was also well worth seeing.",
          "A beautiful small castle right next to the royal guard training grounds.",

          "Amazing jewellery exhibition.",
          "Very dark place, crown jewels were the best bit",
          "Rosenborg castle is one of my favourite sight seeing stops in Copenhagen. The grounds and building itself is beautiful and walking around the building and seeing all the historic artifacts, paintings and what it looked like to live in this \u2026",
          "All the waiting aside, the exhibit is impressive. \nThe reason for poor rating is I witnessed a person needing a wheelchair disallowed AFTER they purchased the tickets with the full price and waited for over an hour to get inside. Absolutely shameful.",
          "Situated in the center of Copenhagen in a gorgeous park with beautiful gardens.",
          "Cool castle that is definitely worth checking out.",
          "Nice from the outside but a long que to get inside so we just visited the park",

          "Next to a beautiful park there is a entry for the Castle",
          "A cool, small castle to introduce how the Danish kings and queens lived through the absolutism. The crown jewels are really the cherry on the top.",

          "If you want jewels, diamonds and a taste of the Danish Royalties. Please go, you will love it....",

          "impressive grounds, beautiful castle.  some confusion between the line to get into the castle and where to purchase the tickets for the line to get into the castle. there was a downloadable app, skip it, did not work on the 2nd floor.  go \u2026",

          "It's very worthy to buy ticket for visiting.",
          "I would say impressive. Especially inside. With many hidden secrets, what most impressed me is the luxurious style it had although it was buit in 1606.

          "Went in for a quick look as we passed by. Lots of beautiful rooms and interesting items. Apperantly missed the information about the phone app or web page (?) with information about the rooms and items, I only realized by chance that was why everyone had their phones out...",

A lot of the focus here at Rosenberg is on Christian IV but a lot of other interesting things including the Danish Crown Jewels. Another venue with free entry if you have a Copenhagen Card - highly recommended.",
          "Pretty cool collection of paintings, jewels, and artifacts from Danish history. Very expansive garden to just stroll around in too. Grab a self-guide manual and spend some time on each floor browsing the collection. The jewels in the basement are well worth the visit.",

          "One of the Best castles in Denmark. Free entrance on the territory and garden. Lots of fish in the pond. A must visit in Copenhagen",
          "Fantastic palace, loads to see. Great historical content. Arrive early, opens at 9am, as it gets really busy. It's good they only allow 150 people in at a time so it's not crowded but this adds to the wait.",

        "wiki": "Amalienborg (Danish pronunciation: [\u00e6\u02c8m\u025b\u02c0ljn\u0329\u02ccp\u0252\u02c0]) is the home of the Danish royal family, and is located in Copenhagen, Denmark. It consists of four identical classical palace fa\u00e7ades with rococo interiors around an octagonal courtyard (Danish: Amalienborg Slotsplads); in the centre of the square is a monumental equestrian statue of Amalienborg's founder, King Frederick V.\nAmalienborg was originally built for four noble families; however, when Christiansborg Palace burned on 26 February 1794, the royal family bought the palaces and moved in. Over the years various monarchs and their families have resided in the four different palaces.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The first palaces on the site ===\n\nThe Frederiksstaden district was built on the former grounds of two other palaces. The first palace was called Sophie Amalienborg. It was built by Queen Sophie Amalie, consort to Frederick III, on part of the land which her father-in-law Christian IV had acquired outside of Copenhagen's old walled city, now known as the Indre By district, in the early 17th century when he had been king. Other parts of the land were used for Rosenborg Castle, Nyboder, and the new Eastern fortified wall around the old city.\nIt included a garden, a replacement for the \"Queen\u2019s Garden\" which had been located beyond the city's western gate Vesterport, an area today known as Vesterbro, and which had been destroyed under siege from Sweden in 1659. \nWork on the garden began in 1664, and the castle was built 1669-1673. The King died in 1670, and the Queen Dowager lived there until her death on February 20, 1685.\nFour years later on April 15, 1689 Sophie Amalie\u2019s son King Christian V  celebrated his forty-fourth birthday at the palace with the presentation of a German opera, perhaps the first opera presentation in Denmark, in a specially-built temporary theatre. The presentation was a great success, and it was repeated a few days later on April 19. However, immediately after the start of the second performance a stage decoration caught fire, causing the theatre and the palace to burn to the ground, and about 180 people lost their lives.\nThe King planned to rebuild the palace, whose church, Royal Household and garden buildings were still intact. Ole R\u00f8mer headed the preparatory work for the rebuilding of Amalienborg in the early 1690s. In 1694, the King negotiated a deal with the Swedish building master Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, who spent some time in Copenhagen that summer reviewing the property. His drawing and model were completed in 1697. The King, however, found the plans too ambitious and instead began tearing down the existing buildings that same year, with the reclaimed building materials used to build a new Garrison Church.\nThe second Amalienborg was built by Frederick IV at the beginning of his reign. The second Amalienborg consisted of a summerhouse, a central pavilion with orangeries, and arcades on both side of the pavilion. On one side of the buildings was a French-style garden, and on the other side were military drill grounds. The pavilion had a dining room on the groundfloor. On the upper floor was a salon with a view out to the harbour, the garden and the drill grounds.\n\n\n=== Development of Frederiksstaden by Frederick V ===\nAmalienborg is the centrepiece of Frederiksstaden, a district that was built by King Frederick V to commemorate in 1748 the tercentenary of the Oldenburg family's ascent to the throne of Denmark, and in 1749 the tercentenary of the coronation of Christian I of Denmark. This development is generally thought to have been the brainchild of Danish Ambassador Plenipotentiary in Paris, Johann Hartwig Ernst Bernstorff. Heading the project was Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke, one of the most powerful and influential men in the land, with Nicolai Eigtved as royal architect and supervisor.The project consisted of four identical mansions (see below), built to house four distinguished families of nobility from the royal circles, placed around an octagonal square. These mansions (now called Palaces) form the modern palace of Amalienborg, albeit much modified over the years.\n\n\n=== As a royal residence ===\nWhen the Royal Family found itself homeless after the Christiansborg Palace fire of 1794, the palaces were empty for long periods throughout the year, with the exception of the Brockdorff Palace, which housed the Naval Academy. The noblemen who owned them were willing to part with their mansions for promotion and money, and the Moltke and Schack Palaces were acquired in the course of a few days. Since that date successive royal family members have lived at Amalienborg as a royal residence and kings have lent their names to the four palaces; Christian VII's Palace, Christian VIII's Palace, Frederick VIII's Palace and Christian IX's Palace.\nA colonnade, designed by royal architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, was added 1794-1795 to connect the recently occupied King\u2019s palace, Moltke Palace, with that of the Crown Prince, Schack\u2019s Palace.\n\n\n== The four palaces ==\n\nAccording to Eigtved\u2019s master plans for Frederikstad and the Amalienborg Palaces, the four palaces surrounding the plaza were conceived of as town mansions for the families of chosen nobility. Their exteriors were identical, but interiors differed. The site on which the aristocrats could build was given to them free of charge, and they were further exempted from taxes and duties. The only conditions were that the palaces should comply exactly to the Frederikstad architectural specifications, and that they should be built within a specified time framework.\nBuilding of the palaces on the western side of the square started in 1750. When Eigtved died in 1754 the two western palaces had been completed. The work on the other palaces was continued by Eigtved's colleague and rival, Lauritz de Thurah strictly according to Eigtved\u2019s plans. The palaces were completed in 1760.\nThe four palaces are:\n\nChristian VII's Palace, originally known as Moltke's Palace\nChristian VIII's Palace, originally known as Levetzau's Palace\nFrederick VIII's Palace, originally known as Brockdorff's Palace\nChristian IX's Palace, originally known as Schack's PalaceCurrently, only the palaces of Christian VII and Christian VIII are open to the public.\n\n\n=== Christian VII's Palace ===\n\nChristian VII's Palace is also known as Moltke's Palace, and was originally built for Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke. It is the southwestern palace, and has been since 1885 used to accommodate and entertain prominent guests, for receptions, and for ceremonial purposes.\nMoltke\u2019s Palace was erected in 1750\u201354 by the best craftsmen and artists of their day under the supervision of Eigtved. It was the most expensive of the four palaces at the time it was built, and had the most extravagant interiors. Its Great Hall (Riddersalen) featured woodcarvings (boiserie) by Louis August le Clerc, paintings by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and stucco by Giovanni Battista Fossati, and is acknowledged widely as perhaps the finest Danish Rococo interior.\nThe mansion formally opened on 30 March 1754, the King\u2019s thirtieth birthday. Due to Eigtved's death a few months later, final work such as the Banqueting Hall, was completed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin.\nImmediately after the Christiansborg Palace fire in February 1794 and two years after the death of the original owner, the royal family, headed by the schizophrenic King Christian VII, purchased the first of the four palaces to be sold to the royal family, and commissioned Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to turn it into a royal residence. They occupied the new residence December 1794.\nAfter Christian VII\u2019s death in 1808, Frederick VI used the palace for his Royal Household. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the Palace in the years 1852-1885. For short periods of time in the intervening years the palace has housed various members of the royal family while restoration took place on their respective palaces. In 1971-1975 a small kindergarten was established at the palace, and later a schoolroom, for Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.\nAfter 200 years the facade, decorated by German sculptor Johan Christof Petzold, was severely damaged, causing parts of Amalienborg Place to be closed to prevent injury. In 1982, exterior and interior restoration began that completed in early 1996, Copenhagen's year as European Capital of Culture. In 1999, Europa Nostra, an international preservation organisation, acknowledged the restoration with by presenting a medal.\nThe palace is occasionally open to the general public.\n\n\n=== Christian VIII's Palace ===\n\nChristian VIII's Palace is also known as Levetzau's Palace, and was originally built for Privy Councillor Count Christian Frederik Levetzau in 1750\u201360. It is the northwestern palace, and was the home of Crown Prince Frederik until 2004. After his marriage to  Crown Princess Mary, they moved into the Chancellery House at Fredensborg.\nAfter Eigtved's death in 1754, royal architect Lauritz de Thurah carried out supervision of the building's construction according to Eigtved's plans.\nThe palace was sold by the entailed estate of Restrup, which had been established in 1756 by Levertzau, the late owner. The family set one condition when they sold the building\u2014 that the Count\u2019s coat of arms should never be removed from the building. It can still be seen beside that of the monarch's.\nThe King's half-brother Frederik bought the palace in 1794, and painter and architect Nikolai Abildgaard modernized the interiors in the new French Empire style. The palace was named Christian VIII\u2019s Palace after his son, Christian Frederik, who grew up in the palace, took over the building in 1805 upon the death of his father, and would become king in 1839.\nChristian VIII died in 1848, and the Queen Dowager, Caroline Amalie, died in 1881. From 1885 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the Palace, but moved in 1898 when the Palace became the residence of Crown Prince Christian (X) and Princess Alexandrine. After the death of Christian X the Palace was placed at the disposal of Prince Knud, the Heir Presumptive.\nToday, there is little left of the remaining rococo interior; much of the interior reflects the changing taste and style of its residents over the years.\nIn the 1980s the palace was restored as residence for the Crown Prince, storage facilities for the Queen\u2019s Reference Library and a museum for the Royal House of Gl\u00fccksborg. The museum features private royal apartments from 1863 to 1947 including original fittings and furnishings.\n\n\n=== Frederick VIII's Palace ===\n\nFrederick VIII's Palace is also known as Brockdorff's Palace. It is the northeastern palace, and was the home of Queen Dowager Ingrid until her death in 2000. It has recently been renovated and is the home of the Crown Prince Frederik and the Crown Princess Mary.It was originally built for Count Joachim Brockdorff in the 1750s. Brockdorff died in 1763, and Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke acquired the palace. Moltke sold it two years later to king Frederick V.\nFrom 1767 it housed the Danish Military Academy, also known as the Army Cadet Academy (Landkadetakademi). In 1788 naval cadets replaced the army cadets until the Academy moved to another location in 1827.\nThe following year the palace was prepared to house king Christian VIII\u2019s son, Frederick VII, who ascended the throne in 1848, and his bride, Princess Vilhelmine. Architect J\u00f8rgen Hansen Koch successfully and thoroughly refurbished the palace in French Empire style in 1827\u201328.\nAfter the marriage was dissolved in 1837, various members of the royal family lived in the palace. In 1869, it became the home of Frederick VIII. In 1934, it became the home of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid.\n\n\n=== Christian IX's Palace ===\n\nChristian IX's Palace is the southeastern palace, and is also known as Schack's Palace. It has been the home of the royal couple since 1967.\nBuilding work was commenced in 1750 by Eigtved, and was supervised first by architect Christian Josef Zuber and later by Philip de Lange.\nIt was originally commissioned by Privy Councillor Severin L\u00f8venskjold, but in 1754 he had to give up due to economic difficulties. The project was taken over by Countess Anna Sophie Schack n\u00e9e Rantzau and her step-grandson Count Hans Schack. A fire shortly after the change of ownership delayed completion by a couple of years.\nOn 7 January 1757 Hans Schack married Countess Ulrikke Auguste Vilhelmine Moltke, daughter of Adam Gottlob Moltke, and as his son-in-law had use of the best artists and craftsmen to complete the interiors.\nIn 1794 the palace was taken over from private residence by the Regent, then Crown Prince Frederick, and his wife, Crown Princess Marie. He died in 1839, and she in 1852. The palace was used after her death by, among others, the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nIt was later the home of Christian IX until his death in 1906. The home remained untouched afterwards until 1948. In 1967 the Palace was restored for the successor to the throne, Crown Princess Margrethe and Prince Henrik.\n\n\n== Royal Guard ==\n\nAmalienborg is guarded day and night by Royal Life Guards (Den Kongelige Livgarde). Their full dress uniform is fairly similar to that of the Foot Guards regiments of the British Army: a scarlet tunic, blue trousers, and a navy bearskin cap. The guard march from Rosenborg Castle at 11.30 am daily through the streets of Copenhagen and execute the changing of the guard in front of Amalienborg at noon. In addition, post replacement is conducted every two hours.When the monarch is in residence, the King's Guard (Kongevagt) also march alongside the changing of the guard at noon, accompanied by a band that plays traditional military marches. The Guard Lieutenant (L\u00f8jtnantsvagt) is always alerted when Prince Henrik or another member of the royal family are reigning in absence of the Queen. There are three types of watches: King's Watch, Lieutenant Watch and Palace Watch. A King's Watch is when Her Majesty the Queen takes up residence in Christian IX's Palace. A Lieutenant Watch is when Crown Prince Frederik, Prince Joachim, or Princess Benedikte, takes the place as regent, when the monarch is unable to. A Palace Watch is when no member of the royal family is in the palace, and it is the smallest one. \n\n\n== Equestrian statue ==\n\nThe equestrian statue of King Frederik V was commissioned by Moltke, as Director for the Danish Asiatic Company, and it was made by French sculptor Jacques-Francois-Joseph Saly. Work began in 1753, and the foundation stone was laid in place in 1760 at the 100-year celebration of political absolutism in Denmark. The statue was finally unveiled in 1771, five years after King Frederik V's death in 1766.\n\n\n== Amaliehaven ==\n\nThe Amalie Garden (Danish: Amaliehaven) is located between the waterfront and Amalienborg Slotsplads. Established in 1983, it was a gift from the A.P. M\u00f8ller and Chastine McKinney M\u00f8ller Foundation to the citizens of Copenhagen. The two-level garden was designed by Belgian architect Jean Delogne. It features marble sculptures and a central fountain designed by Italian Arnaldo Pomodoro. It is owned jointly by the Danish state and the municipality of Copenhagen, and maintained by the Palaces and Properties Agency.\n\n\n== Axis alignments ==\nThe short axis on which Amalienborg lies, Frederiksgade (English: Frederik\u2019s Street) has been much discussed due to construction the building of the Copenhagen Opera House in 2001\u201304.\nAligned on the short axis are:\n\nFrederik's Church (Danish: Frederikskirke), commonly known as The Marble Church (Danish: Marmorkirken).\nAmalienborg\nCopenhagen Opera HouseThe long axis on which Amalienborg lies is Amaliegade (English: Amalie Street).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Baroque residences\nList of castles and palaces in Denmark\nTourism in Denmark\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmalienborg at the Danish Monarchy official website\nCopenhagen-Portal - Amalienborg Palace and History\nSee photos from Amalienborg Castle",

The complex was designed and constructed by the Danish architect Nicolai Eigtved, who also designed numerous other buildings in the surrounding district. At the centre of the court stands a much-admired equestrian statue of Frederick V by the French sculptor Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Saly. Originally the mansions were city residences for nobility. After a fire at the royal residence, Christiansborg Castle, in 1794 the royal family moved to Amalienborg, and they have continued to use the mansions as residences and for state functions.

      "name": "The Round Tower",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Round Tower (Danish: Rundet\u00e5rn), formerly Stellaburgis Hafniens, is a 17th-century tower located in central Copenhagen, Denmark, and one of the many architectural projects of Christian IV of Denmark, built as an astronomical observatory. It is most noted for its equestrian staircase, a 7.5-turn helical corridor leading to the platform at the top at 34.8 meters above ground, and for the expansive views which it affords over Copenhagen.  \nThe tower is part of the Trinitatis Complex which also provided the scholars of the time with a university chapel, the Trinitatis Church, and an academic library which were the first facilities of the Copenhagen University Library which had been founded in 1482. Today, the Round Tower serves as an observation tower for views of Copenhagen, a public astronomical observatory, and a historical monument. The Library Hall above the church is only accessible along the tower's ramp and is a venue for exhibitions and concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAstronomy had grown in importance in 17th-century Europe. Countries had begun competing with each other in establishing colonies, creating a need for accurate navigation across the oceans. Many national observatories were therefore established, the first in 1632 at Leiden in the Dutch Republic. Only five years later the Round Tower Observatory, first referred to as STELL\u00c6BURGI REGII HAUNIENSIS, would follow.\n\n\n=== Planning and preparations ===\n\nAfter Tycho Brahe had fallen out of favour and left Denmark, Christian Longomontanus had become Christian IV's new astronomer and the first professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen. In 1625 he suggested the king build an astronomical tower as a replacement for Brahe's Stjerneborg which had been demolished Steenwinckel|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref>\nLongomontanus' initial proposal was to erect the new observatory on the top of the hill Solbjerget, now known as Valby Bakke. But since there were also plans for the construction of a new students' church and a library for the university, the idea of merging the three buildings into one grand complex emerged.Already in 1622, Christian IV had bought the land where it was ultimately decided to build the Trinitatis Complex. His original plans for the site are not known but as it was conveniently located next to the Regensen dormitories and the university, it was chosen for his new prestigious project.\nAlthough there is no clear proof, it is generally accepted that Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger was charged with the commission to design the new edifice though he did not live to see the tower completed. \n\nFrom 24 November 1636, stones were brought to the site for the foundation, first from the city's ramparts and later from the area around Roskilde. Bricks were ordered from the Netherlands since local manufacturers could not meet the high quality standards requested. In February 1637, a contract was signed with a Henrik van Dingklage in Emden for the supply of bricks for the construction. The first three ship loads were to be delivered in May, the next three loads the following month and the remainder on demand.\nThe Trinitatis Complex was set for construction in a crowded neighbourhood of narrow streets and alleyways. The area first had to be cleared. On 18 April 1637, 200 men, soldiers and personnel from Bremerholm began to demolish the half-timbered houses occupying the site.\n\n\n=== Construction phase ===\nThe foundation stone was laid on 7 July 1637. When Hans van Steenwinckel died on 6 August 1639, Leonhard Blasius was brought to Denmark from the Netherlands as new Royal Building Master. Unlike his predecessor, he would become a mere transitional figure in Danish architecture, dying just four years after his arrival in the country without leaving any notable buildings of his own design. On several occasions construction work came to a standstill due to shortage of funds. Churches in Denmark and Norway were therefore ordered to contribute a share of their earnings during the construction years. In 1642, the tower was finally completed, though the church was completed only in 1657 and the library in 1657.\n\n\n=== Time as an observatory ===\nChristian Longomontanus became the first director of the observatory. In the Great Fire of 1728 the Trinitatis Complex was severely damaged but was rebuilt.\n\n\n=== Demise and later years ===\n in connection with his proposal to move the tower to a position next to the church]] \n \nDuring the early 19th century, the Round Tower became outdated as an astronomical observatory. Instruments were growing still larger while the tower could not be expanded and, at the same time, light pollution from the surrounding city and vibrations caused by the ever increasing traffic in the streets below had made the observations inaccurate.  The University therefore decided to build \u00d8stervold Observatory on the old bastioned fortifications of the city, which had become outdated and were being decommissioned. The new observatory was inaugurated in 1861 to the design of Christian Hansen.\n\n\n=== Notable ascents ===\nIn 1716, The Czar Peter the Great ascended the staircase on horseback while visiting Copenhagen. His wife, Catherine I, reportedly ascended behind him in a carriage.\nIn 1902, a Beaufort car was the first motorised vehicle to ascend this Round Tower.\nA medal in the Round Tower's collection of medals indicates that the first bicycle race held in the tower took place as early as 1888, possibly in connection with The Nordic exhibition of Industry, Agriculture, and Art.\nIn 1911, the newspaper Socialdemokraten arranged a bicycle race down the Round Tower.\nIn 1971, Ole Ritter won a bicycle race against Leif Mortensen up the Round Tower in a time of 55.3 seconds.\nIn 1993, Henrik Djernis won a bicycle race against Jens Veggerby in a time of 50.05 seconds.\nIn 1989, Thomas Olsen went up and down the Round Tower on a unicycle in 1 minute and 48.7 seconds, which is a world record.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Round Tower is a cylindrical tower built in masonry of alternating yellow and red bricks, the colours of the Oldenburgs. The bricks used were manufactured in the Netherlands and are of a hard-burned, slender type known as muffer or mopper. On the rear side, it is attached to the Trinitatis Church, but it has never served as a church tower.\nSteenwinckel \u2014 whose name is otherwise synonymous with Dutch Renaissance architecture in Denmark \u2014 with the Trinitatis Complex has left his signature style. Unlike his other buildings with their lavish ornamentations and extravagant spires, the complex is built to a focused and restrained design. Hans van Steenwinckel must have been up on the situation in Holland, cogniziant that the style which he had once learned from Hendrick de Keyser had been altogether abandoned.The architects now setting the agenda in the Netherlands, masters such as Jacob van Kampen (Amsterdam City Hall), Pieter Post (Mauritshuis in the Hague) and Philip Vingboons, now favoured a style characterized by sobriety and restraint. It is now known as Dutch Baroque or sometimes Dutch Classicism. Its proponents often relied on the  theoretical works such as those of Andrea Palladio and of Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola. Steenwinckel may have paid a visit to his native Netherlands prior to his change in style but it will have been too early for him to have seen any of the period's buildings realized.\n\n\n=== Spiral ramp ===\n\nInstead of stairs, a 7.5-turn spiral ramp forms the only access way to the towertop observatory as well as the Library Hall and the Bell-Ringer's Loft, both located above the church. The ramp turns 7.5 times around the hollow masonry core of the tower before reaching the observation deck and observatory at the top, on the way also affording access to the Library Hall as well as the Ringer's Loft. This design was chosen to allow a horse and carriage to reach the library, moving books in and out of the library as well as transporting heavy and sensitive instruments to the observatory.\nThe winding corridor has a length of 210 m, climbing 3.74 m per turn. Along the outer wall the corridor has a length of 257.5 m and a grade of 10%, while along the wall of the inner core the corridor is only 85.5 m long but has a grade of 33%.\n\n\n=== Observation deck ===\nThe observation deck is located 34.8 m above street level. Along the edge of the platform runs a wrought-iron lattice made in 1643 by Kaspar Fincke, Court Artist in metalwork. In the latticework, Christian IV's monogram and the letters RFP are seen, the letters representing the King's motto: Regna Firmat Pietas \u2013 Piety strengthens the Realms.\n\n\n=== Observatory ===\n\nThe observatory is a small domed building, built on the roof of the tower. Built in 1929, the current observatory is 7 m high and has a diameter of 6 m. Access is by a narrow winding stone staircase from the observation deck.\n\n\n=== Rebus inscription ===\nOn the upper part of the fa\u00e7ade of the tower, there is a gilded rebus inscription. Christian IV's draft of it, written in his own hand writing, is kept at the Danish National Archives. The rebus includes the four Hebrew consonants of the Tetragrammaton. The rebus can be interpreted in the following way: Lead God, the right teaching and justice into the heart of the crowned King Christian IV, 1642.\n\n\n== Toilet ==\nThe tower contains a toilet used by the researchers and astronomers working in the tower and consisting of a seat almost at the top and a shaft leading down to the bottom floor built into the hollow core. This shaft has no way of emptying it nor any ventilation to the outside, making it arguably one of the world's largest and earliest septic tanks.\n\n\n== The Round Tower today ==\nToday the Round Tower serves as an observation tower, a public astronomical observatory, an exhibition and concert venue and a historical monument.\n\n\n=== Public observatory ===\nIn 1860 the University of Copenhagen decommissioned the Round Tower as a university observatory but in 1928 it was reconstructed as an observatory with access for amateur astronomers and the general public. It is open from mid-October to mid-March.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions and concerts ===\nSince 1987, the Library Hall which lies above The Trinitatis Church, has served as an exhibition space, featuring various exhibitions of art, culture, history and science. At the same time, it is used as a concert venue, every year hosting around a hundred concerts.\n\n\n=== Views ===\nThe observation deck affords extensive views over the rooftops of the old part of Copenhagen with its many spires, including the Marble Church, the Nikolaj contemporary art center, Christiansborg Palace, Christiansborg Slotskirke, the Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen City Hall, Palace Hotel, the Church of Our Lady, St. Peter's Church, the Great Synagogue, St. Andrew's Church, Rosenborg Castle, the Church of Our Saviour and the pipes of Amagerv\u00e6rket. On clear days, both the \u00d8resund Bridge and Sweden can be seen in the distance.\n\n\n=== Rundetaarn Unicycle Race ===\nEvery year in spring, a unicycle race is held in the Round Tower. The contestants have to go up and down the tower. The world record, set in 1988, is 1 minute and 48.7 seconds.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nIn Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Tinder Box, the largest of the three dogs is said to have eyes as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen.\nIn another Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Elder-Tree Mother, an old married couple remembers how they used to go \"up the Round Tower, and looked down on Copenhagen, and far, far away over the water; then we went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen were sailing about in their splendid barges!\".\nIn Hans-Christian Andersen's novel, To Be, or Not To Be, the main character, Niels Bryde, is born and grows up in the Round Tower, where his father is a gatekeeper.\nA 1:3 scale replica of the tower has been built in the originally-Danish-settled city of Solvang, California.\nThe asteroid 5505 Rundet\u00e5rn commemorates the tower.\nIn Denmark, heights of buildings are often compared to the height of the Rundetaarn.\nA phrase in Danish is \"Which is highest, the Rundetaarn or a crash of thunder?\" (loud and high are the same word in Danish). It is often used in a discussion when the opponent tries to compare incomparable quantities - see also Apples and oranges.\nFeatured in \"SimCity (2013 video game)\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Denmark\n\u00d8stervold Observatory\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCopenhagen-Portal - The round Tower of Copenhagen and its history\nOfficial website\nRundetaarn at Structurae",

      "name": "The Little Mermaid",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Little Mermaid (Danish: Den lille Havfrue) is a bronze statue by Edvard Eriksen, depicting a mermaid becoming human. The sculpture is displayed on a rock by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is 1.25 metres (4.1 ft) tall and weighs 175 kilograms (385 lb).Based on the 1837 fairy tale of the same name by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and has been a major tourist attraction since its unveiling in 1913. In recent decades it has become a popular target for defacement by vandals and political activists.\nMermaid is among iconic statues that symbolize cities; others include: Manneken Pis in Brussels, the Statue of Liberty in New York and Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. In several cases, cities have commissioned statues for such a purpose, such as with Singapore's Merlion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, who had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale in Copenhagen's Royal Theatre and asked the ballerina, Ellen Price, to model for the statue. The sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue, which was unveiled on August 23, 1913. The statue's head was modelled after Price, but as the ballerina did not agree to model in the nude, the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, was used for the body.The Copenhagen City Council arranged to move the statue to Shanghai at the Danish Pavilion for the duration of the Expo 2010 (May to October), the first time it had been moved officially from its perch since it was installed almost a century earlier. While the statue was away in Shanghai an authorised copy was displayed on a rock in the lake in Copenhagen's nearby Tivoli Gardens. \nCopenhagen officials have considered moving the statue several meters out into the harbour to discourage vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it, but as of May 2014 the statue remains on dry land at the water side at Langelinie.\n\n\n=== Vandalism ===\n\nThis statue has been damaged and defaced many times since the mid-1960s for various reasons, but has been restored each time.\nOn April 24, 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement, amongst them J\u00f8rgen Nash. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and placed on the statue. On July 22, 1984, the right arm was sawn off and returned two days later by two young men. In 1990, an attempt to sever the statue's head left an 18 centimeters (7 in) deep cut in the neck.On January 6, 1998, the statue was decapitated again; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby television station, and reattached on February 4. On the night of September 10, 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbour's waters. Holes had been blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.Paint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007. On March 8, 2006, a dildo was attached to the statue's hand, green paint was dumped over it, and the date March 8 were written on it. It is suspected that this vandalism was connected with International Women's Day, which is on March 8. The statue was found drenched in red paint on May 30, 2017 with the message \"Danmark [sic] defend the whales of the Faroe Islands\", a reference to whaling in the Faroe Islands (an autonomous country in the Kingdom of Denmark), written on the ground in front of the statue. About two weeks later, on June 14, the statue was drenched in blue and white paint. \"Befri Abdulle\" (Free Abdulle) was written in front of the statue, but it was unclear what this referred to at the time. Later, police said the writing was likely referring to Abdulle Ahmed, a Somalian refugee who has been detained in a high security unit in Denmark since 2001 due to a custody sentence. On 13 January 2020, \"Free Hong Kong\" was painted on the stone the statue is mounted on.Although not regarded as vandalism since no damage is done to the statue, people have also repeatedly dressed it, either for fun or to make more serious statements. In 2004, the statue was draped in a burqa in a protest against Turkey's application to join the European Union. In May 2007, it was again found draped in Muslim dress and a head scarf. Other examples are times where a Christmas hat has been put on the head, or it has been dressed in the jerseys of the Norwegian or Swedish national football teams (especially the Danish and Swedish teams have a highly competitive rivalry).\n\n\n== Copies ==\nAside from the statue on display, which is a replica of the original,  more than thirteen undamaged copies of the statue are located around the world, listed by Mermaids of Earth, including Solvang, California; Kimballton, Iowa; Piatra Neam\u0163, Romania; Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz (Madrid), Spain; Seoul, South Korea; and a half-sized copy in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The grave of Danish-American entertainer Victor Borge includes a copy as well. The Copenhagen Airport also has a replica of the mermaid along with a statue of Andersen.\nSome statues similar to The Little Mermaid are in Sicily. The first it placed in 1962 on the seafront in Giardini Naxos, and measures about four meters high over a fountain.\nA second always portraying a mermaid Post on a depth of sea about 18 meters. Inside the Marine Protected Area of Plemmiro of Siracusa.A statue of 'The Little Mermaid' looks out over Larvotto beach in Monaco.  She was created, in 2000, with layers and layers of metal by Kristian Dahlgard, in homage to the Danes who live in Monaco and for the late Prince Rainier III to mark the 50th year of his reign.\nA copy of the statue forms the Danish contribution to the International Peace Gardens in Salt Lake City.  The half-size replica was stolen on February 26, 2010, but was recovered on April 7 abandoned in the park.\n\n\n== Copyright issues ==\n\nThe statue is under copyright until 2029, seventy years after the 1959 death of the creator. As of 2019, replicas can be purchased, authorized for sale by the Eriksen family.A replica was installed in Greenville, Michigan in 1994 to celebrate the town's Danish heritage, at a cost of $10,000.  In 2009 the Artists Rights Society asked the town for a $3,800 licensing fee, claiming the work violated Eriksen's copyright. At about 76 cm (30 in) in height, the replica in Greenville is half the size of the original, and has a different face and larger breasts as well as other distinguishing factors. The copyright claim was later reported to have been dropped.There are similarities between The Little Mermaid statue and the Pania of the Reef statue on the beachfront at Napier in New Zealand, and some similarities in the little mermaid and Pania tales. The 1972 statue of a female diver (titled Girl in a Wetsuit by Elek Imredy) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada was commissioned when, unable to obtain permission to reproduce the Copenhagen statue, Vancouver authorities selected a modern version.\n\n\n== Censorship ==\nSocial Democrat politician Mette Gjerskov tried to post a photo of The Little Mermaid on her Facebook page but was initially told it had \"too much bare skin or sexual undertones\", and the post was blocked; Facebook later rescinded the ban and approved the image for posting.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe sculpture is seen in the following films:\nSol over Danmark (1936)\nWienerbarnet (1941)\nBundfald (1957)\nForelsket i K\u00f8benhavn (1960)\nReptilicus (1961)\nL\u00f8gn og l\u00f8vebr\u00f8l (1961)\nPigen og million\u00e6ren (1965)\nEn ven i bolign\u00f8den (1965)\nSlap af, Frede (1966)\nHopla p\u00e5 sengekanten (1976)\nOlsen-banden g\u00e5r i krig (1978)\nWalter og Carlo i Amerika (1989)\nKrummerne (1991)\nCopenhagen (2014)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMermaid of Warsaw\nMermaid of Zennor\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nMermaid of North\nThe Little Mermaid.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (\"ny\" means \"new\" in Danish; \"Glyptotek\" comes from the Greek root glyphein, to carve, and theke, storing place) is an art museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. The collection is built around the personal collection of Carl Jacobsen (1842\u20131914), the son of the founder of the Carlsberg Breweries.\nPrimarily a sculpture museum, as indicated by the name, the focal point of the museum is antique sculpture from the ancient cultures around the Mediterranean, including Egypt, Rome and Greece, as well as more modern sculptures such as a collection of Auguste Rodin's works, considered to be the most important outside France. However, the museum is equally noted for its collection of paintings that includes an extensive collection of French impressionists and Post-impressionists as well as Danish Golden Age paintings.\nThe French Collection includes works by painters such as Jacques-Louis David, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Degas and C\u00e9zanne, as well as those by Post-impressionists such as van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Bonnard. The museum's collection includes all the bronze sculptures of Degas, including the series of dancers. Numerous works by Norwegian-Danish sculptor Stephan Sinding are featured prominently in various sections of the museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First Glyptoteque ===\nCarl Jacobsen was a dedicated art collector. He was particularly interested in antique art, but over the years he also acquired a considerable collection of French and Danish sculptures. When his private villa in 1882 was extended with a winter garden, sculptures soon outnumbered plants in it. The same year the collection was opened to the public. In the following years the museum was expanded on a number of occasions to meet the need for more space for his steadily growing collections. In 1885 his 'house museum' had grown to a total of 19 galleries, the first 14 of which had been designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup while Hack Kampmann had built the last four as well as conducted a redesign of the winter garden.\n\n\n=== New museum ===\n\nIn spite of the many extensions, it was finally clear the existing premises were inadequate and that a new building was needed. On 8 March 1888 Carl Jacobsen donated his collection to the Danish State and the City of Copenhagen on condition that they provided a suitable building for its exhibition. Copenhagen's old fortifications had recently been abandoned and a site was chosen on a ravelin outside Holcks Bastion in the city's Western Rampart, just south of the Tivoli Gardens which had been founded in 1843. Jacobsen was displeased with the location which he found to be too far from the city centre and he had also reservations about the proximity of Tivoli which he found common. Instead he wanted a building on the emerging new city hall square, yet in the end he accepted.It was Carl Jacobsen who chose the name for the museum, with inspiration from Ludwig I's Glyptothek in Munich, as well as Vilhelm Dahlerup as the architect for the assignment. The moat around the radan was filled and the new museum opened first on 1 May 1897. At first it only included Jacobsen's modern collection with French and Danish works from the 18th century.\nIn January 1899 Carl Jacobsen donated his collection of Antique art to the museum which made an expansion necessary. It was designed by Hack Kampmann while Dahlerup designed a winter garden which connected the new wing to the old building. It was inaugurated in 1906.\nIn 1996 the museum was once again extended, this time with an infill constructed in one of its courtyards to the design of Henning Larsen. In 2006, the building underwent a major renovation programme under the direction of Danish architects Dissing + Weitling. and Bonde Ljungar Arkitekter MAA.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building is often noted for its elegance in its own right and the synthesis it creates with the works of art.\nThe Dahlerup Wing, the oldest part of the museum, is a lavish historicist building. The fa\u00e7ade is in red brick with polished granite columns in a Venetian renaissance style. It houses the French and Danish collections.\nThe Kampmann Wing is a more simple, neo-classical building, built as a series of galleries around a central auditorium used for lectures, small concerts, symposiums and poetry readings.\nThe two wings are connected by the Winter Garden with mosaic floors, tall palms, a fountain and topped by a dome made in copper and wrought iron.\nThe Henning Larsen Wing is a minimalistic infill, built in a former inner courtyard and affording access to the roof.\nOfficial meetings and banquets sometimes take place in the Glyptotek, such as the certification of Polio-free Europe, 21 June 2002.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek's collections comprise more than 10,000 works of art.\n\n\n=== Antique collection ===\nThe Antique collection displays sculptures and other antiquities from the ancient cultures around the Mediterranean.\nThe extensive Greek, Roman and Etruscan Collection comprises marble statues, small terra cotta statues, reliefs, pottery and other artifacts. The Etruscan collection is the largest outside Italy. The German archeologist Wolfgang Helbig was Carl Jacobsen's broker in Rome for 25 years, acquiring more than 950 sculptures and Etruscan antiquities for the Ny Carlsberg Museum.The Egyptian Collection comprises more than 1,900 pieces, dating from 3000 BCE to the 1st century CE and representing both Ancient Egypt, the Middle Kingdom and the Roman Period. It was founded in 1882 when Carl Jacobsen made his first Egyptian acquisition, a Sarcophagus purchased from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Many of the objects in the collection were augmented when the Ny Carlsberg Foundation sponsored excavations in Egypt in the beginning of the 20th century led by the English Egyptologist W. M. F. Petrie . The holdings include several mummies, displayed in a crypt-like gallery below the normal galleries.\nThe Near Eastern Collection spans a period of 7150 years, the oldest artifact being from 6500 BCE and the youngest being from 650 CE, featuring such cultures as the Levant, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Persia.\n\n\n=== French Collection ===\n\nThe main focus of the French Collection is 19th-century French painting and sculpture. The painting collection contains works by such painters as David and Manet, as well as a large collection of Impressionist painters such as Monet, C\u00e9zanne and Bonnard. The single painter represented with most paintings is Paul Gauguin with more than 40 works. The museum also holds a large collection of French 19th-century sculpture by artists such as Carpeaux and Rodin, the Rodin collection being one of the largest in the world, as well as a complete collection of Degas' bronze sculptures.\n\n\n=== Danish Collection ===\nThe Danish Collection contains a large collection of Danish Golden Age paintings by painters such as Eckersberg, K\u00f8bke and Lundbye. It also contains the largest representation of Danish Golden Age Sculpture in the country.\n\n\n=== European Collection ===\nThe European Collection comprises works from the 18th to the 20th century. Represented sculptors include Neoclassicists such as Canova, Sergel, Carstens, Flaxman, Rauch and Baily, as well as Modernists like Meunier, Klinger, Picasso and Giacometti.\nThe collection also comprises a small collection of Modern paintings of artists such as\nArp, Ernst, Mir\u00f3, Poliakoff and Gilioli.\n\n\n== Auditorium ==\n\n\n=== Concerts ===\nThe Auditorium is mainly used for classical concerts, including the Helge Jacobsen concert series. Helge Jacobsen Concerts have included the Austrian Hagen Quartet, the Russian violinist Alina Ibragimova, the French pianist C\u00e9dric Tiberghien, the Russian bariton Sergei Leiferkus, the French Ysa\u00ffe Quartet and German tenor Jonas Kaufmann among others.\nThe Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is in general noted for its good acoustics, both in the auditorium and in the surrounding long halls. The Auditorium has been used as a rehearsal room by the Early music vocal ensemble Musica Ficta, often within opening hours of the museum, occasionally adding music to the museum experience, and it has also regularly performed concerts, both in the Auditorium and the surrounding halls. Pioneer overtone singer David Hykes in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in 1997.Occasionally the Auditorium is also used for other musical genres, such as the Danish Klezmer group Mames Babegenush.\n\n\n=== Other cultural events ===\nThe Auditorium is also used for other cultural events, such as poetry readings, lectures and debates.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe museum is used as a location in the films Stjerneskud (1947), Fodboldpr\u00e6sten (1951), Dorte (1951), M\u00f8d mig p\u00e5 Cassiopeia (1951), Bruden fra Dragstrup (1955) and Den k\u00e6re familie (1962).The building was the inspiration for the set design of the Valkyries' Rock in Kasper Holten's 2006 production of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Copenhagen Opera House.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarlsberg Foundation\nThe Carlsberg District\nH.

          "We have been in a lot of museums of the past 12 years of traveling Europe and I would say this one is easily in the top 5 we have seen. It is not so much the sheer number of pieces this one man collected, but more about how well they are arranged and presented. We were there a",

          "Now we know why this museum is so popular and highly rated. It is packed with rooms of art and sculpture galore from a variety of ancient countries and eras. It is also packed with customers, especially on Free Tuesdays. There are nice bathrooms here, as well as a fairly large",

          "After a city tour, and seeing mostly artifacts and historic things at the National Museum, we wanted to see some fine art. This was a great choice, and highly recommended. They have a small but nice collection of mostly French Impressisonists, we saw a lovely ( somewhat",
          "The Glyptotek is a bit of a labyrinth although they give you a useful map and a little booklet with all the highlights. We decided to concentrate on French Masters and the Danish Golden Age because you just can't see everything in one visit. We added the brilliant Pierre",

          "We only visited the ancient sculpture exhibits (Roman, Greek, Egyptian and Middle East) and were overwhelmed by the breadth and age of the treasures show. The pieces range in age from the Ancient Egyptian (oldest about 1450 BC) to Roman BC, up to 2nd-3rd Century AD. Don't miss",
          "Very nice, quiet, organized museum. It was not crowded and the pass was included on the Copenhagen Pass. Storage of your bag was free and easy. We added the special exhibition of Pierre Bonnard. This was well worth the extra charge.",

          "Lots of things to see in this museum, art, statues, and even mummies. Items from different times and different parts of the world. We went on a Tuesday and it was free admission which only excludes any special exhibitions. It was busy, but not as busy as I expected since it was",

          "Best part was having lunch in cafe off Palm courtyard. Rooms are lined with busts or statues in strange arrangements. A new curator might help make collection interesting but it was one of the most boring museum visits in a long time. Skip this and go straight to Louisiana",
          "No matter what your preference in art, you will find examples here, from early Egyptian to present day. Fascinating for me (as we had just been in Egypt) was the stairs leading to the mummy exhibit. It reminded so much of our descent into a tomb in the Valley of the Kings. I",

          "I guess it was OK as best I can remember. Not being able to recall much about a museum, or anything for that matter is not a good thing.Nothing memorable, just an average museum with a significant number of sculptures and paintings I assume were found in the artist's trash bins.",
          "I am not a sculpture enthusiast but Glyptotek is such a pretty museum. The winter garden, the greens and sculptures are so beautifully coordinated that you have to see it yourself. The colors in each of the exhibition rooms are also wonderfully harmonised. Each time when I",
          "Loved the perfect poses exhibit. Extremely well laid out with excellent notes to follow on the display boards. I liked the subject and how it was displayed - first sitting poses featuring children, then crouching, standing and the difference between male and female models, then",
          "I enjoyed my visit to this museum, but then again I'm a big fan of Impressionism and European sculpture so this museum was right up my alley. The museum is a decent size - not small, but not overwhelmingly large either, and the building itself is worthy of note for its garden",
          "They had some beautiful sculptures here and a lot of paintings. The Egyptian exhibit was closed when we were there so sadly we didn't get to see that. There is a nice fountain in the centre with a few seats around it for you to relax on. There is also a nice cafe. It is worth a",
          "This is a short walk from the Tivoli gardens and very easy to get to by bus, metro or bus. To get in is 115 DKK which is reasonable and the cloakroom is free which is useful when us cold and wet like when we went. Unfortunately some was shut as it was changing exhibitions but it",
          "The atmosphere is quiet and the small botanical garden is a nice way to start a visit. The building is impressive, the wide stairway to the room with the Egyptian collection and the small collection of French impressionists. There tend to be many guest in Tuesday where there is",
          "Overall very nicely done, but somewhat confusing layout even with included map. Some displays were actually too full ... I know that seems strange to say, but when too many items are clustered in a display it minimizes each one on its own. For example, the Rodin statues were",
          "Situated near the Tivoli Gardens, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is a sculpture exhibition centre. When I visited there were sculptures from Roman to Modern on view. I am unsure if the exhibits are permanent or whether they change. The centre has a nice seating area with a lot of",
          "Not just a \"museum\", Glyptoteket is much more. The premises are simply fantastic, do not forget to check out the roof terrace. And of course the statues.which are superb!",
          "This has lots of Roman statues but little else. The building itself is beautiful with a lovely cafe and lots of foliage. When I was there , the same exhibition of sculpture I had seen in Lisbon last November was there so i enjoyed it a second time.",
          "Calm and cool museum in Copenhagen. Very many sculpture designs are attracting including French collection.",
          "The French masterpieces and sculpture collections were outstanding. Very peaceful and interesting gallery.",
          "One of the most amazing museums you can visit! Such a pleasure to walk around these holy walls. Great piece of art, nice stuff. Was so cool to be there! Can absolutely recommend it.",
          "Easy to access with a central city locality. World class collection of antiquities, sculptures and paintings. So much history under one roof. Definitely worth visiting for anyone interested in understanding more about the art of ancient civilizations and more recent times",
          "Nice museum. We went on a \"free day\" and stayed for a couple of hours. The rooftop view of the city is nice and we really enjoyed the Egyptian section.",
          "Excellent museum. Love the crazy marble lady with a dozen babies crawling all over her in the courtyard, the many Degas dancer studies upstairs, and of course the antique and Roman sculpture hall. A bound slave, an incomplete Rodin, and other well known works and at least one",
          "We visited this museum very late in the afternoon and so we didn't get to see all of the collection. However, what we did see (the extensive collection of ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian sculptures) was a pleasant surprise. Even without the vast collection, just getting a",
          "This art museum is a must for Visitors in Copenhagen. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek . The collection is built around the personal collection of Carl Jacobsen (1842\u20131914), the son of the founder of the Carlsberg Breweries. Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek have a wonderful Palm garden in the",
          "We took advantage of the free day of the week to pop in and enjoy the beautiful museum. Wonderful on a chilly February day to sit for a snack overlooking the garden after strolling through the galleries. Easy to go through in an afternoon without feeling overwhelmed.",
          "came in here due to the rain and glad I did, fab collection of art work and statues from different eras.",
          "We stumbled in to this museum by accident and were so glad we did. It's an eclectic mix of all sorts of art from all over and the layout is almost as eclectic as the content. The Egyptian rooms were some of our favourites, and the upstairs painting galleries were a lovely",
          "I\u2019m very disappointed with the treatment we received by one of the staff members at the ticket desk, it was my girlfriend\u2019s birthday and we decided to go visit the museum as it was recommended by one of her friends. When we arrived to the ticket desk we asked for 2 tickets, one",
          "Best place to relax with the beautiful gardens. It is designed and maintaining in a highly precious way. This museum doesn't charge anything for the entry fees. It is free.",
          "Officious entry staff said my handbag was too big, then no access to French paintings. Danish golden age rather limited, like Mother Denmark and same artists mermaid, but the rest so so. Highlight Degas' bronzed on top floor. Restaurant looked nice in lovely winter garden",
          "An odd thing to say about a museum but it\u2019s very relaxing! Maybe it\u2019s the palm garden with the restaurant, maybe it\u2019s the way the exhibits are spaced, but it is! Rather expensive entry when you\u2019re used to the vast and free British Museum, but here we still liked it. Maybe go as",
          "Beautiful place. Stunning gardens in the centre. A great way to spend an hour or so. Visit on a tuesday and its free entry.",
          "Love this museum, my favourite in Copenhagen! The Danish and French statues are truly breathtaking! The building itself is truly beautiful, too and there is a lovely winter garden inside that is well worth the visit. Never tried anything in the caf\u00e8 before, but it is truly",
          "This is a beautiful building with a fantastic collection from the ancient civilisations - including painted recreations of statues - and lots of statues of the gods. They also have a small collection of French painters mostly 19th century and the Winter Garden is a lovely space.",
          "What an amazing museum. Not only for Rodin's sculptures and the winter garden (which, lets admit, are also amazing on their own) but also for the rest of exhibits. Endless hours can be spent here, and if you get tiresome, the view in winter garden is all you need. Havent tried",
          "The glyptotek is housed in a lovely building opposite the Tivoli Gardens and a short walk from Central station. There were many ancient artefacts on display from Egyptian, Roman, Greek and Etruscan civilisations including numerous marble statues, ceramics and even a mummified",
          "The exhibits are amazing and beautifully displayed. I don't even know how many hours I spent there. I only left because it was closing time. I took a small break at the cafe that exists at the Atrium with the tropical plants. I got a nice bonus when I looked out a window and",
          "The \u201cCarlsberg Glyptotheken\u201d is a beautiful building with so lovely rooms. The building itself is one thing, secondly are all the very fine Roman and Greek antique figures. Really worth a visit!",
          "Mind-boggling collection of Egyptian (and Roman) sculptures - world class - even if they're not your thing you can't help but be impressed - and all beautifully displayed. I was lucky - accidentally went when there was a \"nocturne\" with piano music playing throughout the halls",
          "The exhibits are not the sort of thing I am interested in, however i appreciated the architecture and the design of the building itself and the first room which was a bit like a massive greenhouse. Staff were helpful when I couldn\u2019t get my bag out of the locker as well.",
          "Quick fun trip to the Winter Garden and museum. Great for statue lovers, includes many a bust of famous Roman emperors and a wall full of noses! Worth visiting for the Winter Garden alone. Easy to use free lockers downstairs.",
          "Some people love paintings and some enjoy sculptures more. If you are the latter, you would love this museum. The architecture itself is beautiful. And the sculpture collection is great. Some part of the exhibition was closed due to renovation during our visit. What a pity!",
          "Glyptoteket is by far the most beautiful museum I have ever seen! The building, the floors, how they have planned the colours on the walls, the amazing winter garden - that alone is worth a visit! The exhibitions are classic, no surprises. The caf\u00e9 is also very nice. Highly",
          "This place just wasn't for me. I'm glad I went on a Tuesday and didn't have to pay the entrance fee. The view from the top is nice though.",
          "I went here primarily for the paintings and was disappointed. The paintings were pretty run of the mill. You\u2019ll probably appreciate it more if you\u2019re interested in sculptures. The exhibit on sculptures by Edgar Degas was the highlight when I visited.",
          "Visited in January 2019. Private collection of Carl Jacobsen. Various exhibits but the Egyptian and Roman artifacts were particular worth seeing. Nice cafe also.",
          "Thurs evening late opening and chance to squeeze in an exhibition - Odilon Reddon. Didn't expert to come face to face with works by Bonnard, Van Gogh, and other big names. Lovely place to linger.",
          "Really enjoyed the walk around this museum. The entrance hall is relaxing with a small fountain and it is easy to navigate. I advise you make use of the free lockers",
          "In my opinion Ny Carlsberg Glypotek is the best museum in Copenhagen. It houses objects from all over the world and from different timeperiods. Don't forget to viist the Egyptian part of the museum, especially the Mummy!",
          "The building is impressive inside and out. The art is not really my thing at this level but interesting enough",
          "Last time I was at the Glyptotek was more than 20 years ago. Still mesmerizing. Definitely worth a stop each time I visit Copenhagen.",
          "We went here to see all the great impressionism paintings, but they had all been removed for a special exhibition.",
          "Beautiful space - I was more taken by the architecture most of the time than the collection. On a Tuesday it is free entry. I went on a Tuesday in summer and it wasn't too busy - no wait and plenty of space to move around.",
          "Amazing building both, outside and inside. The winter garden at the beginning of yours journey gives a special flavor before you enter into the past. The phenomenal sculptures and paintings from different past ages, the interior of the building with wonderful and different",
          "Fantastic donation of 10,000 pieces from the Carlsberg family a must visit you will spende at least 3 hours",
          "I wonder if those armies of statutes leave their pedestals and start wondering around the buildings once the visitors and staff go home? Seeing them in a very dim light in winter gave me shivers. They look so real, it is scary. So a must see experience for horror film lovers. On",
          "I love Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, its permanent collection and its spirit, but most of all I love temporary exhibitons. This time it is about Odilon Redon \u201cInto a dream\u201d. It cannot be described, it should be seen and experienced. The audio-guide fits seamlessly to the paintings",
          "Probably one of less boring museums in Copenhagen, and definitely not as dry as the Natural history museum. Located near the Tivoli garden, this museum is easy to find and the entry is included in the Copenhagen card. Lots of different styles of art and at the time I visited",
          "If you like heads of long dead Romans and Greeks this is the place for you! Confusing layout and difficult to find everything, Atrium atmospheric",
          "What a beautiful museum!! One of The best ones I ever visited. We really enjoyed walking around here. It is very romantic and fun and the time just passes by. Thank you! :)",
          "This is a beautiful museum that can be viewed in a few hours. It\u2019s a nice collection and we spent a few hours here then moved on with our walking tour of Copenhagen. They provide lockers in the basement for your bags while you tour.",
          "This amazing quiet museum with abundant collections . My interest was in French paintings 1809-1968 . Didn\u2019t expect to see so many gems here . My advise - do not miss it .",
          "We headed here on a Tuesday as we had heard it was free on that day, all was free except the special exhibition which we did not view. If you are interested in art including Roman, Greek and Egyptian art especially sculpture then you will enjoy this museum. I have since learned",
          "I have already been to Glyptotek a few times. If you visit Copenhagen, you must visit this place. The garden, the exhibitions, the shop, are all excellent. It always gives me a good vibe when I visit this place.",
          "I\u2019ll be honest, the draw to this museum was the collection of noses (as heard about on QI) and a toilet break. Toilets are available downstairs before you pay. There was lots in this museum with a beautiful courtyard and cafe in the middle. I wish there was an audio guide",
          "Nice collection and a great size not overwhelming can easily do in a 1/2 day. Love the architecture of the actual building and beautiful courtyard.",
          "As we had the purchased the Copenhagen city card entry was free. The museum had a good collection of sculptures and paintings set with in beautiful gardens,",
          "First I must say that I'm not an art specialist but I do appreciate art in general. I love the mummies and the interior garden, but the rest were statues witch I'm not a fan off.",
          "We decided spontaneously to see the Odilon Redon exhibit here last minute and am so happy we did. not only is the space amazing and the Redon exhibit out of this world beautiful, but many of the permanent exhibits are dreamy. We have all been to some of the most well known",
          "Located close to Central ststion and opposite the Tivoli Gardens, this miseum is a beautiful building with a central Winter Garden which has the galleries to either side. The highlights are the sculpture pieces from Danish and French artists, an exhibition of small experimental",
          "I read about the statues in Glyptotek and thought it would be a museum my husband and I would enjoy. Well. THAT is an understatement! From the minute we walked in, our jaws dropped. The massive collection of sculptures and painting acquired by Jacobsen (of Carlsberg beer",
          "I went to Glyptoteket alone on a Sunday afternoon as my company did not wish to follow. I think that they lost on Copenhagen's greatest cultural attraction and I gained the highlight of my trip. I enjoyed every bit of the museum, but I absolutely adored the French paintings",
          "As we had the Copenhagen card, we gave this museum a try and we were quite surprised. The place is beautiful with a magical winter garden in the middle of it. You can see a lot of sculptures, something that is different than what you see in common. They also had a Egyptian",
          "We saw a nice exhibit of a post impressionistic artist I\u2019d never heard of...Redon. And a lovely coffee overlooking the winter garden. The rest was Greek and Egyptian stolen booty of a capitalist.",
          "The museum has a beautiful interior however I felt the collection was somewhat disappointing. I had heard the museum had paintings by many French Impressionist painters but these were nowhere to be seen. Instead I found room after room filled with marble sculptures.",
          "Our hostel directed us to this wonderful museum, which lets you in for free on Tuesdays. There is a special exhibit and roof terrace you must pay 60 dkk to see, but the buildings themselves are beautiful and the artwork on display ranges from Egyptian sarcophagi, to Rodin",
          "We were invited for a special event in this place and we were impressed. It is a very special place and to my opinion is a must visiting when in Copenhagen. Spend some time there rather than shopping.",
          "The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek is a museum that has something for everyone. It is not the largest museum and its collection is somewhat eclectic. It has a mixture of ancient art and 19th Century European art works. Although we did not bring our children, it is the type of museum",
          "The place is beautiful and peaceful and definitely worth a visit! The sculptures are displayed in breathtaking rooms, unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to see the art section - and that I think would have made the experience much better, so make sure, when you visit, there is an art",
          "The NY Carlsberg Glyptotek is an art museum in Copenhagen. The museum shows a lot of the art work of the son of the founder of the Carlsberg Brewery. The building looks great and the art work is interesting enough to keep you occupied.",
          "I love anything Egyptian! So I was equally surprised and ecstatic when I found out that they have mummy exhibits here! So I hurriedly went inside only to be stopped a couple of times by security coz of things you have to leave in the lockers. Like I wasnt allowed to bring my",
          "A wonderful museum, which also boasts a cool cafe. the original building hosts antiquites, the new wing further in the back European 19th and 20th century masters, Not to miss.",
          "Beautiful building with world class sculptures. One of the largest collections of Rodins. A perfect way to spend an hour.",
          "A friend recommended visiting the Glyptotek and although it wasn\u2019t originally on my to do list I\u2019m so pleased I went. It was the personal art collection of the Carlsberg Breweries founder's son. It has an impressive collection of Greek, Roman, Egyptian and European art. Look out",
          "What an amazing place! A fabulous building with extraordinary collections! We visited it on Thursday, because it closes late (22:00). That gave us the opportunity to admire the sculptures in high lighting contrast. At the central atrium there was a reception and we had a",
          "If you want to see the French paintings, call ahead before you go. They exhibit was closed for renovation when we visited. Beautiful tropical botanical courtyard. Grab a coffee at the cafe and relax.",
          "This is a great place! A delightful collection of sculpture, art and artefacts, which we could not cover in one visit. The indoor garden plus - of course - draught Carlsberg, was a lovely place for a pitstop. Useful free lockers in the basement, for your coats and bags.",
          "Location near Tivoli. Also near the Central Train Station. Several other important museums nearby. I chose Glyptotek because of sculptures by Degas, Rodin and others. There were many noteworthy paintings also. But my best surprise was the actual building. The atrium garden was",
          "Went on a Tuesday which I wasn't aware was free on this particular day. Spent most of the day in the museum walking around taking in everything. Very popular place and right in the heart of town seconds from central station and tivoli. We had lunch in the cafe which was",
          "Went there on the recommendation of a local lady at the library. I clearly was expecting more since I had mentioned my expectations to her. Maybe because most area were closed off. Also, this might be the time of the year where most museum are between exhibitions and changing",
          "This museum had an excellent local collection, although the Danish Masters are not what I would call very exciting. The classical sections are however quite stunning world-class artefacts and well worth visiting.",
          "Would be rated higher but the French exhibit was closed and I really wanted to see it. I love a museum that has wonderful exhibits and is not crowded.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours looking at sculptures from different time periods. There's also some sarcophagi, potery, stone figurines and other archaological discoveries from old greek/mesopotamia area and more. If you're into paintings there's also a large exhibition of",
          "nice collection, loved the winter garden. Its an enclosed garden with tropical plants. We went on the free admission day so it was a little crowded",
          "We visited on a Tuesday as the entry is FREE on Tuesdays and we are not really into museums! However it was lovely! You have to leave your bags in a free locker secured with a pin no of your choice - I would recommend leaving your coat in there too as the museum is VERY warm!",
          "This is indeed a great and huge museum with rich collections of art, varying from Ancient Egypt sculptures to Danish Golden Age paintings. The museum also has a beautiful winter garden with a fountain and palm trees where you can enjoy some coffee and snacks. Please note that",
          "Stunning collection of sculpture. Enjoyed the little garden inside, and the cafe next to it too. Also perfectly sized, so as not to be overwhelming! Loved it!",
          "This is a beautiful museum. Very good exhibits but also a beautiful indoor garden and a great gift/book shop.",
          "One could spend hours at this museum with a wonderful collection of scultpure including the largest collection of Rodin pieces outside France as well as an amazing collection of impressionist art that rivals the Chicago Art Institute. Also, wonderful collection of Danish works",
          "At least they let you in on it ahead of time. If you want other items may be a good visit for you but if you want French art check the fine print.",
          "I was disappointed as two significant areas of the gallery were not open and the admission charge was the highest we had been paid during our time in Copenhagen. To be fair reception did explain this before charging the admission but .. That said, the collection of Danish Art",
          "My husband and I wanted to see the Impressionist Collection at the Glyptotek and walked there while waiting for our hotel room to be ready upon arrival in Copenhagen. What a wonderful collection it was! Besides that, the museum is spectacular. There were fountains, gardens",
          "Rating it 4* for the Degas sculptures. The french painting gallery was closed when we visited (in preparation for a special exhibit in October). Interesting sculpture galleries & paintings.",
          "When I returned to Copenhagen, this was top of my list to revisit. It has some of the finest Greek and Roman sculptures I've ever witnessed, and the most stunning 'winter garden' right in the centre with towering palm trees and beautiful water features.",
          "A calm and rather silent saturday I went to this museum and it did not disappoint! The entry is grand and the price, though a bit steep, is certainly worth it. Because of the higher entry price, this museum despite it's good reputation is not packed with visitors - You can take",
          "I really enjoyed the exhibition here. Many interesting sculptures from Greek to the Romans. The French painting was closed which is a big let down. But to walk around this beautiful museum was good enough. I love the dome when you first entered, the little garden with the big",
          "This museum of sculptures and artworks is well worth visiting. There is so much to see.The winter garden in the centre offers a cool and calm resting place in between each gallery. The main staircase is stunning with coloured floral decorated roof lights. The exhibits are",
          "This huge building houses a remarkable collection of pieces of art of all time. The French collection contains several wonderful paintings from Impressionist artists, while an entire area is dedicated to remarkable sculptures from Neoclassical authors. The largest part of the",
          "Enjoyed the Museum galleries and roof from where we had a breathtaking view of the Tivoli Gardens amusement park and surrounding buildings.",
          "Fantastic museum, airy and amazing Roman exhibits. Best venue in Copenhagen. Next to Tivoli gardens and so combine the two.",
          "After walking for hours through the lovely danish streets, we entered the museum! Wow!! A huge greenhouse greets you! .... And so we walked into it and discover the cafeteria. We were hungry and decided to grab a bite in there. Oh my god....!!! It wasn\u2019t a common cafeteria",
          "This is a beautiful art collection founded in 1888 by the brewer Carl Jacobsen and displaying ancient and modern art. It has a beautiful covered central garden where you can rest and admire the architecture. It is free on tuesdays.",
          "As much as I enjoyed my visit I wouldn't have paid for entry. Every Tuesday is free so make sure you visit then. Lots of sculptures so it's a must if that is your thing. Really interesting exhibition on the Egyptians. Free WiFi and a nice cafe too",
          "Wonderful museum to visit. The building itself is quite interesting to view. The art is exceptional; there is plenty of space to walk around and view beautiful art. The museum is quite centrally located - not too far from Tivoli Gardens",
          "Excellent collection of ancient art, and the Degas exhibition was also impressive. We also visited an interesting exhibition of Roman-era treasures, discovered in France.",
          "Located close to the Central station it is a \u0430\u0448\u044b\u043a\u0435 class museum, and it is nice to see it all the times of a day. Halls are not overcrowded. Good possibility to teach children",
          "We made a trip to this museum on a friend's recommendation to see Gauguin's works. Wow, what a surprise when we were exposed to his pre-Tahiti paintings, and even his sculpture ! So, this is a place to go for Gauguin's fans. The museum collection is quite extended with works of",
          "I love this museum because of its building, its great collection of French paintings and the constant surprises its offers such as the mummy. Good for kids.",
          "Am amazed at how one individual can accumulate such huge amount of Artifacts. Most suitable for those having interest in sculptures. Not many attractions open late into the evening.",
          "I had never heard about NY Carlsberg Glypotek before heading to Copenhagen...and I still wonder why. This has definitely become one of my favorite museums in the world. The space is big but still retains human size. It is not too packed and...WOW....what a collection:",
          "WOW! There is a wonderful collection of artworks here, including a wonderful collection of Rodin. Well worth a stop, plan to spend at least an hour or so.",
          "I am probably more a lover of architecture, then landscape paintings. So I take visitors here, just to show them this beautiful building, even if they are not huge art lovers. From the choice of colors on the walls, to the unexpected indoors tropical mini garden. I love this",
          "I am a very amateur art lover but even I could recognize just how much greatness is collected within these walls. Sculpture is the primary focus but there is an extensive display of impressionist paintings to be seen here. The largest collection of Gaugin paintings I have had",
          "I absolutely loved this place. I was very impressed by the range and quality of the exhibits there. There is a good range of sculpture, artefacts and paintings from the ancient to the modern. I have a personal academic interest in ancient history and had no idea that the",
          "Fabulous building full of interesting exhibits. Can\u2019t wait to return. The views from the roof terrace are fantastic. The garden outside was beautiful. Will try the cafe next time but it looked good, in a lovely setting. The detail in the sculptures blew me away. Very short",
          "Amazing! Do not forget to go on their rooftop patio for a great view of Copenhagen. This museum is well lit and easy to go around. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Copenhagen.",
          "We went on a Tuesday, not even realising that's free day! So much to take in. Lots of sculptures (inc Rodin's Thinker) fabulous impressionists galleries, nice roof terrace to watch the rides at Tivoli....really enjoyed it!",
          "Right downtown in Copenhagen, short walk from the train station. There was a nice variety of art to look at. For paintings, Monet, Renoir were probably ones most would know. The Greek, Egyptian and Mediterranean were my personal favorite exhibits. We had a good day with weather",
          "There are plenty to see in Copenhagen, but this is one that you must not miss. Not only were there a fantastic collection of historical exhibits, from the Greeks to the Egyptians, sculptures, paintings...the building itself with its winter garden, new extension, descent into the",
          "This museum has many interesting items from Egypt, and around the Mediterranean, and also a nice collection of French Impressionist works. But the museum is more than just a collection of artifacts. The Winter Garden is amazing, and the museum itself is overall very nice. When",
          "This lovely museum is next door to Tivoli Gardens and is a must see if you are nearby. There is a lovely area in the main foyer where you are surrounded by lovely plants and fountains.Plenty of seats set around so you can sit and rest. The museum has some lovely paintings and",
          "Very nice museum. it\u2019s quit big and a nice variety of paintings and pictures. in the middle a lovely place to sit in the garden( roof above ). be aware that after warm days it is inside a bit warm.",
          "this museum is absolutely stunning for the historical artefacts it houses a real must see . The Egyptian is especially interesting as is the roman section there is also an excellent French art section",
          "Beautiful sculptures, great winter garden. Very aesthetic, worth the price. Tuesdays are free, keep in mind.",
          "They have a varied selecton of art work, ranging from Roman to modern. The facility is free on Tuesdays. The Danish Golden Age painters was an eyeopener. But, maybe we've been spoiled with other art museums, but this seemed like a nice second tier facility. Nothing special.",
          "Like a mini British museum. Hard to believe a private collector could amass so many priceless pieces. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "This museum was on the way to Tivoli and accidentally fell into our laps. Wonderful French impressionist collection and beautiful architecture. Go. It is great.",
          "That is a museum you could spend a whole day or more in. It is very big indeed, you can easily get lost in it, and contains a huge collection of priceless artifacts and art starting with ancient \u2013Etruscan, Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Persian, through modern sculpture-Danish,",

          "We went to see the impressionist paintings and Degas statues. The paintings were wonderful as was the Rodin statues but the 3rd. floor housing the Degas statues was closed because it was too hot! Haven\u2019t they got fans?",
          "Great museum, but what puts it apart was the Ancient World exhibits. Rivals the British museum. Besides the statues and art, there is an amazing presentation of a large collections of mummies and sarcophagus. There is also a wonderful atrium with a balcony cafe to relax in.",
          "The Area is going through a lot of construction hence the experience is cumbersome. visit Carlsberg brewery is worth it though",
          "Great museum opposite tivoli gardens. It\u2019s divided into two main eras - ancient (Greek and Egyptian statues, sarcophagi, and other relics) and European art. The upper floors were sweltering in the summer heat - I hope the paintings don\u2019t get affected. Our favourite part was the",
          "If you are fortunate enough to be in the city on a Thursday night, take in this museum. \"Glyptotek\" means sculpture. This top-notch curated collection is totally worth a thorough, leisurely stroll. Hidden from street view is a modern 4 level structure. It presently houses 3",

          "We rely upon Rick Steves' guides, but if we'd followed his advice, we might have skipped this gem of a museum. We love the impressionists, and we were delighted to see paintings that represented less well known periods in many artists' careers. The Gauguin works were a",

          "We liked the french painters and danish art the most, but also the Egyptian part was very good. We skipped most of the antiques, though.",

          "We used the Copenhagen card to get into here. It was a summer day, so it was quite stuffy, which made us quite tired, as the ventilation was not great. I would say there are a variety of art forms and mediums to see and it would take quite a while to see everything. We chose to",

          "Don\u2019t think twice It is worth it We have visited the french and danish paintings and you will be surprised that the danish artists are more than amazing. We also visited the roman sculptures which were amazing too.",
          "Hard to imagine that most of this was collected by one man in a lifetime. Many awesome treasures here including some Rodin sculptures like you see in Paris. Highly recommend.",
          "The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek may be one of the least famous museums in the world given the quality of its art. There\u2019s a relatively small area, spread over three floors, devoted to nineteenth century French art, with a focus on impressionists. The selection is good, but",

          "Spent a good two hours here. Plenty to see and admire. Can get quite hot the higher the floors, that\u2019s expected though especially in July. You have to leave bags in a locker before you start the self guided tour of the place but they are free and easy enough to use.",
          "We focussed on the collection of 19th century paintings and sculpture. Not often you can walk through a gallery with 57 paintings and some sculptures by Gauguin! Picasso, Van Gogh, Lautrec, Monet, Manet, Pissaro and many others, originally collected by the Carlsberg brewery",
          "A fantastic combination of antique statues and art, and a magnfiicent building. Don't miss it! I always go there when I am in Copenhagen (which is a couple of times/year).",

          "Really lovely building and lovely cafe as well as great, electic collection of art, especially sculpture.",
          "This is one of many gifts from the Carlsberg founders to the people and city of Copenhagen, it is located a short walk from the Tivoli Gardens back towards the royal palace island, and well worth taking a look at both the Building and the collection if you have the time",

          "It was painfully hot in there. They had some Degas sculptures on display on an upper floor I couldn't stay in there for long because it was 32 degrees Celsius in there. There is a new section that is kind of stashed away to the back in a separate building-that I enjoyed there",

          "Rick Steves didn't give this museum enough credit. It is probably super impressive by European standard, but I still feel it is very much worth a visit for 3-4 hours if you are into Greco-Roman or 19th-century neo-classical/Romantic sculptures. It is a very big and sort of",
          "The museum consists of an old and a new part. Both are wonderful constructions in their own right. The museum frequently has special exhibitions, this time the French exhibition and the sculptural exhibition. Both are very worth while.",

          "My nephew loved this place. We had only a little more than an hour before it closed for the day. I regret that we would have had been here earlier. The building was like a small botanical garden in the middle, nice and cozy sitting surrounding with plants and tree. There was a",

          "The museum is absolutely beautiful. It is filled with unique sculptures from every period of history from everywhere in the world. I loved the Egyptian exposition and the roman/Greek sculptures collection. It\u2019s a must do in Copenhagen and it\u2019s not very expensive. There are",

          "It has been many years since I have visited Glyptotek and we rushed through that time. This time around we did the full monty. Currently the main exhibition is on Roman theme. Bit disappointing, well too much of the same thing, once you see one bust, you seen them all. ;) But",
          "This museum has one of the largest collections of French Impressionism of any I\u2019ve been to around the world. In particular, they have a vast collection of Gauguin: not just the Tahiti stuff, but lots of landscapes and still lifes. There are also quite a few Rodin sculptures,",
          "When in Copenhagen, be sure to visit this nice museum. Lots of statues and paintings and a beautiful building as well.",

          "I was not familiar with this museum but it is terrific. There are extensive collections from Egypt, Greece and Rome as well as more modern French impressionists. The building is lovely inside the collection is a must for museum goers.",
          "Up close and personal with many of the great artists. Manet, Monet, Da Vinci, Picasso and many more. We got there as it opened, and were not rushed at all. We could stay and view a painting or sculpture for as long as we wanted. It was the highlight of our trip for me.Lunch",
          "Not knowing what to expect means that you are never disappointed and this museum was a mystery from the start. It may have been stripped out to accommodate 500 guests but there were few artefacts and no guidance to show the significance of the art or the architecture. Perhaps",
          "As the hotel we stayed in was just nearby, we went to visit the place. Saw ancient and modern art. Saw mummies. We explored the rich and diverse collections. Great learning experience. After the visit, we visited the garden. Well trimmed hedges and colorful flowers.",

          "We went to the Glyptotek on our recent trip to Copenhagen. Aside from the lovely design, with a central glass-ceiling atrium, we particularly enjoyed the extensive French impressionism paintings, the Rodin sculptures, and the Egyptian collection. This was definitely a highlight",
          "Because it was June 5 Constitution Day and it was last day in Copenhagen. So we went to National Museum :)",
          "Really just went here to see the French collection. The main museum was very hot but fortunately the French collection is housed in a new, and cooler, part. Well displayed organised and explained though would have liked the curators to have kept the noise from rowdy tourists",
          "Reviews stated the Egyptian collection was stunning. It was. We were intrigued by the beauty and displays in the various rooms. The statuary, in other parts, of the museum were worth the visit. Good place to visit on a cold or rainy day. The museum is free on Tuesdays.",

          "Superb and beautiful building. Permanent collection of french painters, and interesting exhibitions beside. Recommended!",
          "What an experience! Our journey to Copenhagen was luckily on that time when there were showed famous art painters as Monet, Degas, Renoir etc. In first place the idea of visit was just keep the rain =D but what happened? We stayed there nearly all day. So much to see and wonder.",

          "There are quite a number of good museums in Copenhagen, but the best by far was the Glyptotek. The building itself is noteworthy - especially the interior. They also have an excellent collection of French art and sculptures - from Renoir, Degas, Manet, Monet, Gauguin, to Rodin",
          "This museum stands next to the Tivoli Gardens and compared to some of the London Museums, is not that big but it does house some marvellous art. Having the Copenhagen passes, we were immediately directed downstairs to the cloakrooms where there are the ubiquitous rails of coat",

          "From the outside and just walking in and seeing how much room the gorgeous central area takes up .. I was thinking this would be a rather small museum, and we would go through quickly. I couldn't have been more wrong. First off, this museum is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL !!!!",
          "The Glyptotek is always a pleasant gallery to visit. They exhibit a quite interesting collection describing the etruscan (Italy pre-roman) and an Egyptian / pharaonic - display. Both very interesting, but perhaps not meant for kids (even though my young son enjoyed very much",

          "Although the Glyptotek has a wide range of exhibits from ancient sculpture to castings of Rodin's Burghers of Calais, the real surprise is the breadth of pieces by Paul Gauguin. Most internationally prominent museums feature only one or two of Gauguin's Tahitian pieces. Here",

        "wiki": "Copenhagen (Danish: K\u00f8benhavn [k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8h\u0251w\u02c0n] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality. It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.\nOriginally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the \u00d8resund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, Arres\u00f8, lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the City Hall Square.\nCopenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\nThe Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway) and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannah\u01ebfn [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannah\u00f6fn [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be \"chapman's haven\". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen.\n(English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish k\u00f6pman, Danish k\u00f8bmand, Icelandic kaupma\u00f0ur: in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin caupo, \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is K\u00f6penhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestr\u00e6de have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Str\u00f8get meets R\u00e5dhuspladsen.\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. \nThe natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century. The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, K\u00f8bmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158\u20131191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177\u20131201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\n\nIn disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malm\u00f6 and L\u00fcbeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\nDuring the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the T\u00f8jhus Arsenal and B\u00f8rsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundet\u00e5rn. In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nCopenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of H\u00f8jbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nOn 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have \"put the telescope to the blind eye\" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.\n\nThe Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August \u2013 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.\n\nThe British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture. In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: S\u00f8erne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892\u201394. Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen. The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901\u201302.As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be \"a model protectorate\" and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.The attack, known as \"Operation Carthage\", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren). However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.\n\n\n==== Post-war decades ====\nShortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five \"fingers\" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes. With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nSince the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 have been connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students. Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller on behalf of the A.P. M\u00f8ller foundation, was completed in 2004. In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCopenhagen is part of the \u00d8resund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden. It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the \u00d8resund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malm\u00f6 and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen. By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of N\u00e6stved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sj\u00e6llands Odde.The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (F\u00e6stningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it. Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams S\u00f8, Peblinge S\u00f8 and Sankt J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8.Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city. During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nAmager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre. In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb\u202f). Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 \u00b0C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year. Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F).Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsomr\u00e5det) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Br\u00f8ndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, R\u00f8dovre, T\u00e5rnby and Vallensb\u00e6k as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Fures\u00f8 municipalities, along with the cities of Ish\u00f8j and Greve Strand. They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (R\u00e5dhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.\nCopenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele): Indre By, \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager \u00d8st, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, \u00d8restad, Nordhavnen, Bellah\u00f8j, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Ryparken, and Vigerslev.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nMost of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Drag\u00f8r and T\u00e5rnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (S\u00f8- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politig\u00e5rden building built in 1918\u201324 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.\n\n\n=== Environmental planning ===\n\nCopenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.\n\nCopenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20\u201330% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving. Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.\n\n\n== Demographics and society ==\n\nCopenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen K\u00f8benhavn) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Drag\u00f8r, Frederiksberg, and T\u00e5rnby. Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016).The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016). There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%). There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016). The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially. Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016). The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan. Since the opening of the \u00d8resund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the \u00d8resund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures. The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000\u2013200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in N\u00f8rrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues. There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684. Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Quality of living ===\nFor a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies. In elevating Copenhagen to \"most liveable city\" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning. However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCopenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of \u20ac120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.\n\nSeveral financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.\n\nLife science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the \u00d8resund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malm\u00f6 harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port (CMP). The central location in the \u00d8resund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe. Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors. The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year. 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015. In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city). However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions. The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals. B\u00f8rsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller\u00f8d are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner N\u00f8rrebro, Inner \u00d8sterbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.Sometimes referred to as \"the City of Spires\", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the \"dragon spire\" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.\nRecent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. \u00d8restad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens and zoo ===\n\nCopenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all. It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F\u00e6lledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner \u00d8resund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner N\u00f8rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the N\u00f8rrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.\n\n\n=== Landmarks by district ===\n\n\n==== Indre By ====\nThe historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundet\u00e5rn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Str\u00f8get, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from R\u00e5dhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on \u00d8ster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.\n\n\n==== Christianshavn ====\n\nChristianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on \"Pusher Street\" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.\n\n\n==== Vesterbro ====\n\nVesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants. The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8, one of the Copenhagen lakes. Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The former cattle market \u00d8ksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography. Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969. Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.\n\n\n==== N\u00f8rrebro ====\n\nN\u00f8rrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd halfway up N\u00f8rrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.\n\n\n==== \u00d8sterbro ====\n\nJust north of the city centre, \u00d8sterbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from N\u00f8rrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.\n\n\n==== Frederiksberg ====\n\nFrederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of N\u00f8rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg All\u00e9 connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.\n\n\n==== Amagerbro ====\nAmagerbro (also known as S\u00f8nderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs. Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4\u20137 floors. Further south follows the Sundby\u00f8ster and Sundbyvester districts.\n\n\n==== Hellerup ====\n\nHellerup is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of \u00d8sterbro and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along Strandvejen (a street and further north a road leading to Elsinore) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of Gentofte. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.\n\n\n==== Other districts ====\nNot far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west fa\u00e7ade is reminiscent of a church organ.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nApart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.\n\nAnother important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France. Besides its sculpture collections, the museum also holds a comprehensive collection of paintings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec as well as works by the Danish Golden Age painters.Louisiana is a Museum of Modern Art situated on the coast just north of Copenhagen. It is located in the middle of a sculpture garden on a cliff overlooking \u00d8resund. Its collection of over 3,000 items includes works by Picasso, Giacometti and Dubuffet. The Danish Design Museum is housed in the 18th-century former Frederiks Hospital and displays Danish design as well as international design and crafts.Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, dedicated to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who lived and worked in Rome; the Cisternerne museum, an exhibition space for contemporary art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels; and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens. Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world. The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.\n\nCopenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as caf\u00e9s and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as \"best concert venue in Europe\" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250. Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.Copenhagen is home to the \"K-Town\" punk and hardcore music community. This community developed around the underground scene venue Ungdomshuset in the late 1990s punk scene, with punk- and hardcore acts such as Snipers, Amdi Petersens Arm\u00e9, Gorilla Angreb, Young Wasteners, and No Hope for the Kids emerging as significant bands. The term \"K-town\" got international recognition within the punk-scene with the emergence of \"K-Town\" festivals. In 2001, the first of these was held in Ungdomshuset, on Jagtvej 69, N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen. The festival temporarily moved to Freetown Christiania after Ungdomshuset was evicted from its original location until a new Ungdomshuset location was opened on Dortheavej 61.For free entertainment one can stroll along Str\u00f8get, especially between Nytorv and H\u00f8jbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMost of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684\u20131754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter H\u00f8eg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15\u201318 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (K\u00f8benhavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the \u00d8stre Anl\u00e6g park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the \u00d8sterport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ish\u00f8j. Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus R\u00f8rbye (1803\u20131848), Christen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848) and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860\u20131934).A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-C\u00e9sar Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris. Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAs of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den R\u00f8de Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Gr\u00f8nbech & Churchill, S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans K\u00e6lder, Rel\u00e6, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014, sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d \u2013 a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.\n\n\n=== Nightlife and festivals ===\n\nCopenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously. Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in N\u00f8rrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gef\u00e4hrlich, which also serves as a bar, caf\u00e9, restaurant, and art gallery.Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in F\u00e6lledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators. Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshale\u00f8en in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square. Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.\n\n\n=== Amusement parks ===\n\nCopenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world. Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943. Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCopenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students), Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students), Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each), Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students), KEA (c. 4,500 students), IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen (2,300 students).The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479.

It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.\nThere are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby. FC K\u00f8benhavn plays at Parken in \u00d8sterbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Br\u00f8ndby plays at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Br\u00f8ndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.\n\nCopenhagen has several handball teams\u2014a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the \"highest\" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup). The K\u00f8benhavn H\u00e5ndbold women's club has recently been established. Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, R\u00f8dovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August. This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship. In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services. October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.\n\n\n=== Road, rail and ferry ===\nCopenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the \u00d8resund Bridge. The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic. The \u00d8resund train links Copenhagen with Malm\u00f6  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nCopenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway. In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. N\u00f8rreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis, and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Br\u00f8ndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nCopenhaden has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants. In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year. The city's bicycle paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have their own signal systems \u2013 giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nPromoting health is an important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its \"Long Live Copenhagen\" (L\u00e6nge Leve K\u00f8benhavn) scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities. The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.Copenhagen University Hospital forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in Region Hovedstaden and Region Sj\u00e6lland, together with the faculty of health sciences at the University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet and Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals. Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital, and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy. In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions. It benefits from the presence of in-service students of medicine and other healthcare sciences, as well as scientists working under a variety of research grants. The hospital became internationally famous as the location of Lars von Trier's television horror mini-series The Kingdom. Bispebjerg Hospital was built in 1913, and serves about 400,000 people in the Greater Copenhagen area, with some 3,000 employees. Other large hospitals in the city include Amager Hospital (1997), Herlev Hospital (1976), Hvidovre Hospital (1970), and Gentofte Hospital (1927).\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMany Danish media corporations are located in Copenhagen.

          "Well worth a visit if you're in Copenhagen, tonnes of animals to see, the pandas are always a popular attraction. For 10DKK, it's well worth going up the tower for superb views of the city, but you want to be feeling fit for the stairs!",

          "We come here once a year and the kids love it. The zoo is also building a lot of new houses, cages for the animals and they seems have a great place. For this year the zoo also expanded number of places to eat which always been a challenge before. Really good.",
          "I am truly sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed. This zoo is in between old cages with bears and leopards and huge areas for pandas and kangaroos. The stereotype behavior I saw at animals in the old cages was sad! Why spent so much money on pandas as they like to live",
          "We visited the zoo using our Copenhagen cards and planned to stay for a couple of hours just to see some of the more unusual animals that we hadn't seen before. We prioritised the polar bears, pandas, bears and kangaroos but also saw various others and ended up staying longer",
          "Amazing to see the Pandas, and some of the animals are impressive, but the place looks a bit old fashioned, and the enclosures feel too small and restrictive. Some animals show signs of boredom and distress, pacing and shaking.",
          "We loved our day out at the zoo. We spent more than 4 hours here and could have spent longer. It is so spacious and the grounds are lovely. There are many good outlets and so many places to stop and sit for a while. My boys enjoyed seeing the polar bear as it was a first for",

          "I was excited to visit the zoo as I have not visited one in years. But really shocked to see the condition of the zoo!! Although there was quite a variety of animals, the zoo's maintenance is absolutely terrible. Its dirty... especially.. the underwater exhibits are so dirty",
          "There are always something going on in the ZOO. Go see for yourself. Can always find some deers that are doing something.",
          "There are banners across streets in the city advertising the new Giant Pandas rented from China. We had never seen Pandas and were really eager to see them. They were in their enclosure and we never saw them. Pity the enclosure is designed in a way that makes them difficult to",
          "We were saddened to see the state of this zoo in what is otherwise a progressive city. There appeared to be a dead seal in a tiny area with two other seals swimming around it. So many animals looked distressed. The polar bears were pacing back and forth with nowhere to go. The",
          "Zoo Copenhagen have loads of different animals from around the world - around 260 species. Recently two pandas was added, and they are fun and cute to watch. The zoo tower also gives a very nice view and sight of Copenhagen city. We have annual pass and visit the zoo for small",

          "wow the Zoo was by far the best trip we did in Copenhagen there was so much to see - crafts for the kids to do & make, loads of food choices, playparks we struggled to see everything in one day - fantastic day!",
          "It is indeed a great place and a popular family destination, but I feel it is a little overrated, I did not find anything special in it that differentiates it from other European zoos. Also, there aren't many food options.",
          "This was a nice zoo. It wasn't too big (especially after just walking the National Zoo in Washington DC), but it had a nice assortment of animals. My toddler loved it. I thought it was a little expensive to get in. I was also a little torn about the animal enclosures. They were",
          "It was so sad to watch all the animals in such small areas.Some without the possebility of being in the shadow. The animals seemed apathetic because of lack of space, shadow, and enough water/grass/trees. We were shocked and appalled!",
          "In my opinion this is a nice place for enjoy with your friends or family, the polar bears are really beautiful \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Came away feeling really disconcerted having witnessed some upsetting animal behaviour ( lots of pacing , monkeys throwing themselves at the glass etc ) and the tiniest enclosures for some of the big animals I have ever seen. The big cats and bears literally had no where to go.",
          "I adore pandas, and too see the 2 pandas at Copenhagen zoo was a joy, it\u2019s a big zoo with lots of things to see, including a polar bear which I had never seen before.",
          "Always love to visit this place, its not cheep ,but you know that the money is going to the animals, and you can bring your own food and have a picnic, and spend most of the day her, lots to se, new pandas amongst the favorites",
          "Good experience. It\u2019s cost about 195 Kr. Nice to visit . Good location EASY to find. Helpful staff,,!",
          "This was included in our Copenhagen card, nice and easy to find using public transport. We didn\u2019t expect it to be so big, and there were certainly plenty of animals there. Our favourite were the bears, they were very active! And you can get so close to many, including the",
          "This is a terrific place for kids. Lots of interesting animals in beautiful surroundings and a very good playground which should not be missed if you have kids from age 1-10. If you don't want to try the variety of food shops they have, you can bring your own food and eat it in",
          "Great place, loads to see. My favourites were the polar bears, playing together. There was plenty of room everywhere so that you could see whatever you wanted to. It\u2019s a long walk round, across the road to cover both sections of the zoo, but we didn\u2019t want to miss anything! The",
          "This is perhaps one of the most impressive zoological gardens we have seen. The number of animals and more importantly the comfort most seem to be given is very significant. Small ecosystems are created to offer animals varied conditions. Some can probably be improved. The way",
          "Nice but the tickets are extremely expensive. There are better zoo\u2019s in europe. Not worth the price. Maybe if you have alredy seen everything in Copenhagen...",
          "Honestly, we came for the lazy Panda and stay laying down for almost 3 hours. The Zoo is cozy and you can complete it in few hours. We enjoyed seeing the Panda for the first time but we wished to see it more active and close. Kids will enjoy it and staff are friendly.",
          "I am very distressed to see the state of some of the enclosures mostly the state of the water ones. The sea lions tank is so putrid it smells really bad and you can\u2019t even see in it it\u2019s so filthy. The hippo tank is no better and the brown and polar bears water is just as bad.",
          "We had a very please tell couple of hours here. It is clean and not crowded. But maybe we have been spoilt by some zoos we visited. If you have small children a plus point is all the enclosure are fairly close together, the down side of that is they are relatively small. We",
          "We took the bus 6a round the corner from the central station direct to the Zoo. 'Free' with a Copenhagen Card. So too was the entry to the Zoo. We loved the panda, lions, and polar bears. There were a wide range of animals to see. We had lunch at Folk which was a good price and",
          "Today we visited the zoo using a Copenhagen Card (allows you to visit many venues after buying it). We had heard a lot about the zoo prior to visit as an acclaimed world class zoo. We have visited many zoos around the world including many large ones such as San Diego and",
          "Took the hop on bus here as situated out of the main centre. Spent about 4 hours here, lots of places to eat and sit as you go around, bigger than you first think. Nice petting area with young goats interacting with children. Bears and polar bears great to see, and a lazy panda,",
          "Spent a good part of a day with the family, including young and teenage boys, at the Copenhagen Zoo. Everyone liked the zoo and found it a relaxing and educational experience. The Copenhagen Zoo is located a bit outside of the center of Copenhagen and occupies areas on both",
          "Went with an open mind and was very disappointed. Even getting in is a pain. Even if you have ticket you need to queue at a turnstile so one of the staff scans you in with a phone. The polar on its own was pacing continuously and repetitive in a small enclosure. Mg pet dog pen",
          "Our visit was in May, By chance, the zoo acquired 2 pandas in April. Yes, we did have a look at the pandas - well, in fact, 1 rather shy panda. We were quite surprised at how long we spent at the zoo - nearly 5 hours - so clearly there was a lot to see and a lot to interest one.",
          "We used our Copenhagen card to visit for the morning. Arctic exhibit was just ok, but the other parts of the zoo were quite enjoyable. My kids loved the children\u2019s zoo.",
          "Went to the zoo for the first time in years and thought Copenhagen zoo was small so would take a morning to visit. We couldn't be more wrong. The layout of the zoo is amazing and you get so close to the animals that you are captivated, especially the polar bears. The zoo is very",
          "A good selection of animals in a smallish space so it's easy to view lots. HOWEVER, that in itself is the problem. Lots of animals have spaces that are too small. The environments are not especially stimulating. The water for the seals was dirty. And the fact they are still",
          "We had the Copenhagen card, so access to the zoo was free. We absolutely loved this zoo, even though it was raining while we were there. The polar bears were amazing, there was a little baby and a cleverly designed tunnel where the polar bear would swim around your heads. The",
          "The zoo is about 20min away from city center. Many beautiful animals with decent habits. They are well taken care of. Giraffes, pandas, rhinos, hippo, lions and cubs, sea lions, on and on. Love them all. The zoo also has lots of playgrounds and facilities keeping young and",
          "Zoo is a tradition with our granddaughter - and the Pandas made it imperative to visit now. We spent 5 hours, including lunch in the Panda area, and enjoyed the Pandas as well as the cute ice bear cub. The walk through the savanna is great as well as the jungle. We always try to",
          "Been there with my wife and 10 months old son and I can tell you that we\u2019ve loved it. Spending the entire day to walk around, having nice lunch (restaurant folk) and play with animals (in the kids zoo section) you can see all types of animal : panda (newly added in April 2019),",
          "It was a nice sunny day which meant all the animals were out, even saw the pandas which was great. Some of the enclosures could defiantly be better for the animals, the brown bears and polar bears seemd very stressed and had small encosures. Also the lions and baboons had small",
          "amazing experience lions are great and relaxed the polar bear is great and royal and probably the best attraction for the kids and the people the seal show is great the penguins are fun very easy to get here from city centre via bus/walk/taxi",
          "We visited the Copenhagen zoo in January 2019. We found they had a reasonable selection of animals to see, but also found it somewhat depressing as the zoo appears to be quite old, and many of the enclosures are much smaller than what you see elsewhere in the world. I likely",
          "Wouldn't recommend this zoo at all. They're trying to cramp as many animals in as possible and most the animals looked sad. I understand this is a city zoo but they can't cater to the animals spacial needs. I came out of the zoo feeling worse than when I went in it has",
          "If you love nature in the Frederiksberg, a lovely place to visit with children, and a good walk and keeping the children interested in animals. Ideal duringi summer but always open during other seasons. My niece loved the elephants.",
          "We visited quite some zoos and I have never see the animals so playful then here. Loved the interaction of the lions with the cubs and seeing the two brown bears. There is some construction going on for the arrival of the pandas in April. Bur you can actually walk further from",
          "I love how this zoo is just on the roadside in the city. The road also separates the zoo and there is a tunnel underneath the road to another section which houses giraffes, horses, cows, rhinos etc. Not to be missed. This zoo does have some rather small areas especially for the",
          "Covered in the false justification of conservation this is simply a money making operation. If they were truly concerned about animal welfare and responsibility, they would change considerably. I\u2019m amazed that a country like Denmark would allow this especially in this day and",
          "Really enjoyed our trip to the zoo, the polar bears are a must see and the underwater tunnel was amazing. The only downside was the building work, which is understandable that it necessary for the zoo to improve, however they need better temporary signposting as the zoo has",
          "The zoo is going through a lot of building works, I understand new enclosures are being made for pandas. However the rest of the zoo looks tired to me and the animals have very little space, I felt extremely sorry for them, and I would like the zoo to free their large animals",
          "Close to parks and Carlsberg brewery (who also offer tours) so you can easily spend most of the day here, have lunch and possibly dinner as well in the area. Lots of walking so small children might get tired quickly.",
          "Brilliant trip to the zoo! I have never seen a zoo before where animals did not feel like they are caged up, plenty of space and animals we never have seen before! Food was cheap, gift shop was cheap (in England everything is way overpriced!), the zoo was easy to walk around and",
          "Free entry with the Copenhagen Card, thoughtfully laid out. The Arctic ring is something else, you enter the building down a long slope and are faced with a large viewing window - nothing to see when we got - as we rounded the corner the reason was clear, the polar bears were",
          "Visited the zoo as we have visited a few around the world now, have to say this zoo was by far the worst zoo we have visited. It made me really sad to walk around and look at all the enclosure as pretty much every single one was tiny for the size of the animal and all all there",
          "The zoo is located about 15 mins drive from city center which is close enough. It has a great size. The facilities are well kept, clean and have clever designs. The Most important thing is how their animals were kept. They were in well conditions. The fees weren\u2019t expensive.",
          "I wanted to like this. And coming from Australia I can see (in hindsight) how I would have expected much better conditions from such an affluent and compassionate country such as denmark. The monkey enclosure is appaling. Dirty, overcrowded , tiny, no trees.... It was heart",
          "We enjoyed the visit to this zoo. It was not huge , but was interesting and had some animals we did not usually see in the States.",
          "This has to be the best zoo we have ever visited for it\u2019s size and location. It is easy to get to by bus, metro or train from the centre of Copenhagen and takes about 15 minutes. The enclosures are really well designed, there is a good range of different animals, play areas and",
          "Visited here for a morning in Copenhagen. Superb zoo, has a different variety of animals than a normal zoo. Especially enjoyed the arctic collection with polar bears and wolves. This is free with a Copenhagen card and is definitely worth the visit. A short 10 min train ride",
          "This is a good zoo with an amazing range of species. All animals looked happy with no stereotypical behaviour observed on the day. Some unique enclosures and many arctic species to include musk ox, arctic fox, polar bears, reindeer, snowy owls etc. I got the tram which is so",
          "I had never seen a Polar bear in real life until I came to this zoo, was very worried about what type of enclosure a polar bear had as it\u2019s so much smaller than what their used to but when I arrived I realised there was 2 polar bears living together and had massive enclosures,",
          "If you have the Copenhagen Card and a couple of extra hours, this is a great attraction. A zoo that has nice habitats is the best we can expect. Some animals were pacing, but such is the nature of zoos. I was surprised to see so many Australian mammals. It was the first time I",
          "We visited on Wednesday and there weren't many visitors so it was very quiet. We saw almost all the animals. It was a very cold day so some of the animals were inside or sheltering but we were patient and managed to see them when they did decide to venture out. The panda",
          "The zoo was a great decision to visit! It\u2019s beautifully decorated for Christmas! Christmas lights and Christmas trees are everywhere! The animals are out and look beautiful! Very well taken care of! The lion is a beautiful beast! The kangaroos have little joeys in their pouches.",
          "In this zoo you find all the animals you can imagine. Some of the animals have got new places to be and it look realy very like their natural envirinmet. Check the Zoos website for feeling hours - lots of fun.",
          "It was a bit strange, to be honest, because there were so few other people in the zoo on a Monday afternoon (which is surprising because so many things are closed in Copenhagen on Mondays). They had a wide variety of animals, and I particularly enjoyed seeing the elephants",
          "Best day out I had in Copenhagen, so many things to see you don\u2019t realise how long you\u2019re there for. Well worth the money & would definitely visit again.",
          "Copenhagen zoo claims to have about 3000 animals. We could not see as many . Also lot of reconstruction work was going on when we visited. But the zoo is well laid out with lot of species in larg areas dedicated for animals. It is a place to visit in Copenhagen particularly if",
          "Took my kids here, and it is the first zoo we've been to. Most of the animals had more areas to be in, large areas. It's very plus size friendly, although I'm a bit unsure how disabled-friendly it is, as not all facilities has elevators (that we could see atleast). It took no",
          "Nice and cozy, mordern zoo. Very environmental concerned. You can bring a lunch pack a do a picnic or you can by food there. It is a bid expensive. Right next to a wonderfull Garden/Park called Frederiksberg Have.",
          "The zoo is well integrated into the city so, depending on the time and the day you may find some trouble to park nearby the zoo, however, it is possible to park in one of the closeby neighborhoods for free. You just need to walk 10 min to the main entrance. Once in the zoo you",
          "Myself and my boyfriend visited the zoo and both purchased the zoo plus package. With this we received a free meal and drink each as well access to the zoo and a trip up the zoo tower. We worked out that it was a worth while saving especially if are going to be eating at the",
          "First of all I don't like zoos so much. For me in zoos the conditions and enclosures of animals are the most important thing. I've been in a couple of zoos in Europe, but this was suprisingly good-looking zoo. The Enclosures of animals were suprisingly big. First I thought that",
          "The zoo is only minutes by bus from the City center. Extensive planning and effort on habits is evident. The African exhibit is the largest on the site with many species in a beautiful setting. Lectures and other educational programs are regularly scheduled. We spent a few",
          "Traditional zoo with a good selection of animals and birds. Quite run down and perhaps in need of some maintenance. Animals live in rather small and alien enclosures, quite a bit below the standard I have seen in other zoos.",
          "A great zoo, definatley worth a visit for adults and kids alike. Not far from carlsberg experience so you could do both on same day. Really active animals and you can get very close to some! Nice variety of animals. Good facilities and spacious.the sugar and cinnamon churros are",
          "This zoo was nice experiens, there were lots of animals and they seems to be happy with their lifes. There was construction work going on for pandas, so part of the area was not in use.",
          "Me and my wife have been to many zoos around the world including San Diego and many in the U.K. I must say, this was one of the top zoos we\u2019ve been to. The reason for this wasn\u2019t the enclosures or the facilities, it was because the animals were the most active we have ever",
          "Not much to Say Nice Palace. In the Midtown. The security is Nice to i Will for sure visit this zoo again",
          "We went here on a monday morning and it was a perfect day. Utilised the full hours and caught nearly everything. The panda exhibit is being constructed but there are enough things to see. The toilets are aplenty and the only disappointment were not enough restaurants or closed",
          "It\u2019s a great zoo, can\u2019t wait for the panda to be there, my four years old was so excited to find out that panda will be coming to this zoo!",
          "Always renewing themselves, and still keeping details from the early days, such as the Zoo tower. You must see the elephants area as well as the icebears bassin with underwater tunnel for visitors.",
          "Usually I am not a fan of zoos because of the poor animal treatment but this is so far the best I have been to. Animals look very healthy and well taken care of, enclosures are spacious and reflect natural habitat. You can get up close to the animals and see them interact. Plan",
          "Had a lovely stroll around this zoo! Very well laid out. Some of the enclosures I think need to be bigger but all animals seemed to be in good condition. Be aware that inside the park doesn\u2019t except cash.",
          "Really enjoyed my visit. Although I didn not have any with me it is very interactive for children. I loved the lions and the polar bears. I spent just over two hours there but I was in my own and fairly quick so I\u2019d advise 3-4 hours for family\u2019s. Clean facilities. Only comment",
          "Been fortunate to visit some great zoos over the last couple of years, including London and Berlin was a bit apprehensive given some of the reviews. But from the moment we walked in a saw a lion so close it felt like you could touch it we were wowed by this place. Despite the",

          "Great Variety of Animals including polar bear, Kangaroo, Anteater etc ... the best part is the zoo managed to keep them as much as open free atmosphere as possible for the animals",
          "Little to see, few directions of where animals were, grounds poorly kept.New panda area is being constructed affecting passage through the zoo.",
          "Getting to the zoo is very easy using buses but not the train. Decent enough when it comes to Animals and birds. The Polar bear was a good and fun to see. Food and drinks are overly priced so please carry your own in case u are on a budget. If you are in Copenhagen for a couple",
          "Very disappointed with the condition of this zoo. Apparent that work is going on to hopefully make this a much better environment for the animals. They should research the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida for an example of a fabulous city zoo. The highlight of the visit was the",
          "I'm not a fan of zoos, but it was on our Copenhagen card and close by, so we went. I was pleasantly surprised. It's small, well laid out, and a good selection of animals. They look comfortable enough in their areas, (if any animal can said to be comfortable in captivity).",
          "We love animals and we are always nervous about visiting animal attractions as we want the animals to be treated well. While visiting here you can see that a lot of work is going on to improve the lives of the animals and the animals looked content on the whole. They also have",
          "Plenty to see and do, but not very well laid out. We found ourselves going around in circles. Not many staff about to ask for help. We did enjoy it but found ourselves comparing it to Dublin Zoo which is excellent. Some of the animals seemed a bit miserable, it was extremely",
          "Really good zoo. You can see a lot of animals even during the day. 2018 they are building Panda place and during the project there is littlebit tricky to find places.",
          "A good day, and lots of good enclosures with clear work underway to increase animals enrichment. However, clear anticipation behaviour was observed from a couple of Polar Bears (shown by the pacing in the photos attached) and the lions and brown bears enclosure was too small!!",
          "We visited Copenhagen Zoo when it was snowing. It was so great, we got to go into the animals sleeping areas and see them keeping nice and warm. I also found it really interesting seeing African animals standing in he snow. It was great to see the variety of animals they have at",
          "I was here with my son, he loves animals and we spend around 3h in the zoo looking at various animals; The things that we didn`t like was that there was so many construction activities around that it really made us work for it to move around and see some of the animals (but that",
          "This ZOO is very modern and you can see the animal are treated the best way ever. You get very close to all the animals without stressing them, and but still with an opportunity to get an insight to their living. The restaurant is not worth spending your time, if you only have a",

          "We visited in the beginning of April at around 3:30 PM. As the week had been relatively fresh, coldish, half of the animals on the Tropical side of the Zoo had already retired indoors, so the visit was somewhat cut short. In summer, the same animals will feel lazy because of",

          "I arrived in the morning at at first was very disappointed as walked round for ages without seeing anything as most animals weren't out their shelters yet. I liked the theming of areas and there is certainly great variety. i was also pleased that there were 2 polar bears (when",
          "We were surprised and delighted to see polar bears playing, hugging and gently biting each other in the water, they looked relaxed. Lions with their 3 cubs enjoying the warm noon sunlight, lots of animals looked relaxed. There are also a couple of playgrounds, the whole zoo",
          "We hopped off the bus to see this famous landmark, but as always it was very crowded with other tourists. It is just a little statue, but many people love to see themselves posed in front of it. With patience you can pay respects to this famous story by HC Andersen. On the",
          "We spent almost half a day at the zoo and what a wonderful experience it was. Though I must say that the signage is quite poor inside so it\u2019s not v straight forward finding a particular animal or route. Some of the animal enclosures felt rather small, but the animals looked",
          "Nice place to see and enjoy a day with your family. We used the copenhagen card for free entry. Easy to reach using google maps advice for the metro and bus.",
          "I was amazed at the number of animals they had at their zoo. They have an actual lion family, the cubs are still young too. I was disappointed with how the moat water looked in some of the enclosures -- green and stagnant looking. The new Panda enclosure is going to be huge. It",
          "Had a few moments of is this right/can I be here but over all very nice, very neat walking through the kangaroo enclosure. Plenty of places for ice cream. They are working on a panda exhibit so there was some construction but a nice family friendly activity",
          "Very well maintained zoo. I felt as if the animals were being well cared for here. There were a lot of animals to see as one might expect in a capital city zoo. It is certainly worth a visit. It's a shame that the entry fee is so high. It struggles to justify it's very high cost",
          "We set off for the Zoo and arrived just after 10am on Saturday morning and the place was already busy. We got a fab sunny day and with free entry with the Copenhagen Card, this was a great place to visit. We hired the cart to pull our daughter and our rucksacks around and this",
          "On our last day my husband said we could visit the zoo as he knows my passion for animals. I live in the UK and frequently visit Chester zoo of which I am a member. The zoo at Copenhagen was really good and especially my favourite was the polar bears which we don\u2019t get to see in",
          "This is a remarkable zoo in that the animals all look healthy, have a good bit of room and are active. The male brown bear is the largest and best looking I have ever seen in captivity. The giraffes and zebras are running around (with ostriches on the side) and we were treated",
          "It was my second visit to this zoo and I still think that it is one of the best, next to San Diego and Paris zoos. It is divided into parts each representing different regions. One of the most interesting experiences was a polar bear swimming above my head (there is a tunnel",
          "Had a lovely trip to the zoo back in February. The weather was very cold so would recommend layers, however the zoo are wonderful by supplying multiple fire pugs and teepees to keep you lovely and warm, you can even roast marshmallows! Lovely day out suitable for the whole",

          "We visited Copenhagen Zoo using our Copenhagen Card for entry. We spent several hours there and there were many animals to see. We didn't realise until we got our map on entry that there was a whole second area called \"The Savannah\" to visit too. We enjoyed seeing the Polar",

          "Was there for nearly 5 houres... Nice to be there again, have not been there for many years. Many new and intresting things.",
          "A classic western European good-standard zoo, with lots of different animals from various global zones etc. Not huge on the scale of some zoos, so fairly easy to get around in say 3 hours. Most of the animals were fairly typical if you've been to zoos like this before.. but the",
          "We have been to many foreign zoos on our adventures, however this was one of the best. There was a large range of animals, and they all looked very well looked after. They all had large, open cages, and were well fed. There were lots of baby animals, and all of the animals liked",
          "Visited it with a friend yesterday. It was a typical danish cloudy/foggy day and still, the visit was very nice! They have a big variety of animals and they do invest in animal enrichment and in their environment. However, CPH zoo is currently building area for an upcoming panda",
          "This zoo has everything you might expect...except it hasn't actually got all the animals as they are building an enclosure for pandas and renovating part of Africa (so no zebras). I also thought some of the enclosures were small for the size and number of animals e.g. The",
          "Having been to some amazing European zoos (Madrid and Valencia especially), this was OK but not a must-see if you go to Copenhagen. Some of the zoo is currently under reconstruction and there's very little signposting so we kept finding dead ends and going round in circles, and",

          "I went with my son who has been a member of Odense zoo for 3 years and copenhagen zoo is way of the mark in comparison. Expensive, poorly signed, animal exhibits where empty. Reception staff acted as though their doing you a favour by taking your money. The only only nice staff",
          "Went here during a cold day in February. First impression, nice people working at the ticket area. The zoo is very big that you could easily get lost. It wasnt that busy when we get there. I want to think that it is because we went during a weekday, but it is very possible",
          "Wasn't sure of my visit to the zoo as alot of the animals seem to be gone. The ones you could see were animals you see in your own country. The pandas, polar bears, giraffes, rhinos, monkeys were not there so was a bit disappointing. All I saw was a seal, a wolf, a large rabbit",
          "A great place to visit with the family. Compared with other zoos I have visited, this one has tried to bring the animals close to the visitors. Especially the Hippopotamus, kangaroo, giraffe and seal exhibitions caught our interest.",
          "Around 15 minutes or so on a bus from Copenhagen Centre (near Tivoli), we used our Copenhagen Card for both bus and entry. The zoo is pretty big and there's lots of different animals to see. A massive attraction for us were the white polar bears, there are lots of glass screens",
          "I visited mainly to see the polar bears in weather that was similar to their natural environment. Unfortunately, they were nowhere to be seen, so that was a big disappointment. There were also a lack of animals in other enclosures as well, such as the brown bears and the musk",
          "Really nice zoo and animals seem happy! Easy to get to. Was a snowy day so did not get to see all the animals but still worth a visit! We would like to come back when the new panda home is finished being built :)",
          "We caught the metro from the city centre to the zoo. The zoo is about 25 minutes from the nearest station by foot. Upon arrival we used our Copenhagen Cards which gave us free access to the zoo. The zoo was quiet as it was a cold, mid-week, January day so we got to have a good",
          "Easy to get to, but a bit of a walk from the centre. Took us about half an hour. The animals all seemed happy which is the most important thing, no small cages and concerns about them being bored. The polar bears swimming was really good and you can view them under water.",
          "Copenhagen Zoo was easily accessible from the city centre. It is well worth a trip with some great animals to see. There is some construction work going on at present when that is completed there will also be pandas to see.",
          "We really enjoyed an afternoon here. To be honest, I'm not the greatest fan of zoos as I don't really like seeing animals enclosed. That said, most of the enclosures were really well designed and spacious. The only one that bothered me was the lions. Lots to see and v well laid",
          "We spent over 5 hours here on a very cold day and could have spent more. It was a little odd seeing animals such as lions in such a cold climate but they and their cubs seemed perfectly happy and at home. It was rather thrilling seeing a polar bear for whom the climate seemed",
          "We decided to visit the zoo as it was included on the copenhagen card and we are glad we did. The zoo was clean and all the animals seemed cared for and had clean enclosures. Great to see the polar bear at different angles and to see him swimming. Caught a glimpse of the grizzly",
          "Plenty of animals at this zoo but their enclosures are not the biggest, particularly for the big cats. Currently building a panda enclosure that looks huge so hopefully some of the other enclosures will be made bigger.",
          "As someone who is concerned for animal rights, I am always skeptical of zoos however this place did not disappoint. The enclosures were very big and the animals seemed happy. The chimpanzee enclosure was bigger than my entire flat! All animals had a big outside and indoor",
          "A trip to Copenhagen Zoo is always an experience. For young or adult, old or teen, it\u2019s amazing. And having traveled the world, no zoo ever reaches the same level of consideration for the animals. Thank you for caring",

          "This is a great zoo. Loved the polar bear exhibit and elephant encounter. Easy to navigate. Took the bus with the Copenhagen card to get there. The polar bear exhibit is very unique.",
          "Turned out that we didn\u2019t pick the best time to go, as the zoo is undergoing a large building project to accommodate a panda couple! But aside from a large portion of the park being a building site, the zoo was lovely, with a large range of animals. As with everywhere else in",

          "I have visited a lot of zoos and generally make a point of doing so as I travel. I was a little disappointed with this one. The array of animals we saw was a little bit limited (I must say that this is the only zoo I have been to where cows, goats, pigs, horses and rabbits were",
          "This is a large zoo with an extensive array of animals. I would have like enclosures to be better kept and some animals looked as if they could do with more space.",
          "Alright, we are quite fond of zoos and we rarely fail to join a zoo in a city we visit. The zoo at CPH is in very good shape and so are all its animals. Especially exquisite are the houses of the tropics with its birds, butterflies and amphibians. I would have taken pics there",

          "The highlight of this zoo was the polar bears for me - the area they are kept in is great - giving the bears a unique land and water environment. The glass viewing tunnel was a highlight for me, you can literally have a polar bear standing above and swimming around you. I found",
          "We visited the zoo today and whilst they did have quite a number of animals, the cages appeared to be a bit unkempt. We felt that the cages could do with a good clean which really put a dampener on the afternoon.",

          "we decided to go to the zoo primarily for the children. We all thought that it was ncely laid out. The zoo had the typical animals one would expect. We were all thrilled to see a polar bear as we had never seen one. We were very surprised to see that we could walk among the",

          "The day we visited had torrential rain and we had to shelter for an hour outside before we could go in! There is little shelter inside but thankfully the rain held off. It is not a huge zoo but it's a great way to spend an afternoon with loads of animals there. I will definitely",
          "We arrived two hour before closing time and it was a perfect two hours. The whole zoo is organized and clean with lots of observation area on all animals. The animals seem to have lots of space. Hopefully. We saw great,beautiful animals such as Polar Bear, family of Lions and",

          "I'm a fan of Zoo's just fun to relax and see what other cities/countries zoo's look like. The zoo was a bit out of my way and thought I was going to pass it up but then I decided since I went to the Cisterns across the street I might as well check out the zoo. I think the best",
          "First of all, I've never been in Zoos like that! It's awesome! A lot of calm animals and a lot of clean greeny territory. All of animals walk around and don't afraid of people that's why I was shocked. At next year they will have a panda so it would be quite good for children))",

          "There weren't many people there. The animals seemed peaceful and in good shape. The lion seemed proud of his two lionesses and four little cubs. They were all beautiful and soaking up the sun. The primate area had some interesting species that I had never seen....so all in",

          "I come from San Diego - so all zoos kind of pale in comparison... However, I did enjoy my time here. Most of the exhibits were quite nice; the explanations are in English, so it's easy to understand things. Lots of families with kids at this time of the year, obviously.",
          "This zoo was able to show me so many new animals that I've never been able to set my own eyes on (coming from the USA). It was very walkable, clean toilets, and a great place to spend my birthday! Also there is wifi!",
          "At Central Station after inquiries boarded the bus to the Copenhagen zoo situated in Fredericksberg. This zoo founded in 1859 is one of the oldest zoo's in Europe and was in 2014 in the news for euthanizing a healthy giraffe and later on also four lions. A 43.5 meters wooden",
          "Being to many zoos I can truly say that this Zoo is really a great experience. They have rebuilt and brought a lot of things up to date. Better space or the animals. Great children's area with full contact with the animals. I love the rainforest, the new savanna and the",
          "I have been to many zoos including Colchester, London, longleat etc. This was not a zoo it was a prison for animals. The lion enclosure was the size of my flat, they were all clearly distressed with no where to hide from the public. Two elephants with there baby were observed to",
          "I visited the Zoo with a local friend of mine last week and I must say I did not like it. the Zoo is big, but the enclosures are quite small, there\u00b4s way too much space in between enclosures and it\u00b4s not very well organised. Staff walked around with their eyes glued to their",
          "We visited using our Copenhagen card and thought it was the best zoo we have been to. There my two children loved all of animals and the layout is brilliant. The viewing areas were great, particularly when you can look down at the animals then go underneath at ground level. We",
          "Good city zoo, not alot of rare species or attractions, kids liked it though and had a nice afternoon.",
          "I love a good zoo, if the animals seem happy and are well cared for and there is a good variety to see. Unfortunately this zoo does not seem to tick these particular boxes, some areas were ok but it is nowhere near as good at the others I have seen (Belfast, Edinburgh, Rotterdam",
          "One of the best zoos I've visited. Lots of animals. They had spacious living areas and were very active.",
          "My wife an I took our 3 year old grandson here. Unfortunately it rained a good portion of the day but we still had a blast. For a City Zoo I thought this was a good one the. Polar bear exhibit was very good and there enough inside exhibits to see that it helped make a rainy day",
          "Wonderful zoo the animals are up close and hence lovely to see. The polar bear and the brown bear were the highlight of our trip. The place is big yet small enough to see easily with kids. Lots of places for a snack / picnic.",
          "This zoo has a lot of different animals laid out in geographical sections which added another dimension to the experience. Most of the animals have large outdoor spaces so they seemed content and not the trapped feeling you get in some zoos. We saw the penguins being fed which",
          "Well worth a visit. Thought we'd only spend a couple of hours in there but were there most of the day. Polar bears were stunning, watching them swim through an underwater viewing area. Giraffes, baby hippos, elephants, rhino, chimps etc Easy to navigate round the zoo, given a",
          "If you have been to any bigger zoo ever - skip it. It's nice but compared to everything else you have to see in Copenhagen it's not worth it since it takes a lot of time. The Arctic area is nice with polar bears swimming in the water, the elephant enclosure is really big as",
          "I was surprised by the size if the zoo and the diversity kf the animals, that part is good. However, i was also surprised by the conditions some of these animals are living in. Many of them, like the bears, had clearly not room enough; chimps area was dirty and smelly and most",
          "Even if you have kids this is not the better place to take them! The animals are ok but the layout of the zoo is poor. Also I noted the polar bear was incredible sad and doing repetitive moments like he was taught to do that.",
          "well i cam here by bus which is a short journey from the centre of copenhagen. I came into this attraction for free with the copenhagen card and saw many good sites in here, it was a warm day so some animals were lethargic but saw chimpanzees,alligators, small monkeys, an",

          "This is a good family attraction for all ages, located close to the largest public park in the city.",
          "It was sunny today and Zoo was full. Families bring children, carrying bags with food, like they go for picnic. Seems like watching animals make them hungry. Animals look ok, even it is not too many spices; lions have two cubs, very cute. But so much noise, so many food courts,",
          "The exhibits are designed wonderfully; we were able to get closer to animals than any other zoo we've visited (or it seemed so, based on how the exhibits are designed. I highly recommend this for a family -- the polar bears and the kangaroos/wallabies were the big hits for our",
          "Copenhagen zoo is a very good and big zoo, which makes a really good effort to have a high standard of animal welfare. A great place to visit, both with and without children. We live in Copenhagen and bought season passes. Kid's zoo is one of our son's favorite places to be :-)",
          "We made a family trip to the Copenhagen Zoo - 7 people, all adults. Although the park is not covering a geographically large area, it has my interesting animals and they all seem to have enough room to live in. In fact, the Zoo is of the modern kind where great effort is made",
          "The zoo is well laid out and requires around 3-4 hours. The best attractions are polar bear, penguines, tigers, lions. Lots of places for kids to have fun. It would be good to add more educational and interactive shows for kids.",
          "This is really an Amazing zoo At the moment Lots of animal babies which makes it even better The staff is really good and informative and the atmosphere in the zoo is great I Can really recommend this place While visiting Copenhagen Thomas",
          "Went here for a visit on our stay i Kobenhagen in july. This is a big zoo with a lot of different animals from around the world. They had maps who made the trip around the park easy. They had a lot of placed you could by food and drinks, also get a pluss for toilets placed",
          "Fine place for a family trip with your grandchildren. No matter what age they have, they find it exciting to look at the exotic animals. Tigers, lions, bears, monkeys, elephants, etc. Nice area as well. Lots of space. You can rent small wagons for the kids. There are also areas",
          "We only visited the first half of the zoo, not venturing through the underground pass to the other side as we were exhausted form ou visit to the viking museum in the morning. They have lots of interesting animals and birds. The food is prricey as you would expect in a, a",
          "It\u00b4s very nice zoo close the city centre. Park is clean. There are many animals. But. I think that Zoo in Prague is largest. The entry to the zoo is including in Copenhagen Card.We spent there approximately four hours.",
          "Wonderful zoo very close to the city centre: we came on foot so we could admire the large park just in front of the zoo. We had planned a morning visit so we could see something else in the afternoon, but we ended up spending all day in the zoo (10-18) because it was such great",
          "We got some great photos at this zoo, it's split into 2 halves with African Reserve animals one the one side and Polar Bears, Grizzly Bears, Tigers etc on the other. I would say this is a great place to bring children too and there plenty of them whilst we were at the zoo. The",
          "Everything was clean and well taken care of. Animals had good places and there was plenty of information about species.",
          "Nice place to spend a day in a very relaxed way in Copenhagen. Would definitely eat off 3 hours of the day. Loads of animals and birds are kept here. A few endangered ones like the Rhinoceros, Minsk, Polar bears can be found here. A Copenhagen card lets you in here for FREE!",
          "The animals must be happy here as there were lots of young, we really enjoyed seeing the joey kangaroos, the lion cubs, the elephant calf, I had never seen a Tanzanian Devil before which was interesting, nor a polar bear who was enjoying eating its dinner. An interesting",
          "The zoo is quite central in Copenhagen. It's a bit pricy as is everything in Denmark. We were 2 adults and a fourteen year old. Child prices only go up to 11 years so had to pay full price for our daughter. \u20ac73 euros is a bit rich. The park is very well thought out it is quite",
          "Really great place to enjoy the day. Many great birds, polar bears, elephants and more. I loved spending the day here and even spotted a red panda sleeping on the tree. The ant eater was strange animal and I was a bit repulsed by the ants. The ostrich was amazing and so were the",
          "This review should not be published, but consider this. This attraction is called Zoo di Copenaghen! What language is that? The title should either be in Danish or English Danish: Zoologisk have English: Copenhagen Zoo",
          "This was a very nice zoo with a lot of cool animals. We saw a baby elephant that was only a few days old, the chimpanzees were fun to watch, and the kangaroo enclosure was the highlight. You weren't allowed to touch the kangaroos but you could walk around with them. So many",
          "We visited the zoo on a really nice sunny day in May and the zoo seemed to be well laid out There are a wide range of animals including some not seen in other zoos like polar bears Tasmanian devils and elephants. The highlight for us was the polar bear...the zoo is very clean",
          "We were very impressed with Copenhagen Zoo on 8.06.17. It was also easy to get to on the bus from the station and it was included in our 72 hour Copenhagen Card. The animals seemed well looked after with beautiful enclosures that gave them space and appropriate environments",
          "Free for Copenhagen Card holders. Nice animals, and a good place to have a rest far from the crowded areas. There are also picnic areas specially designed for families with children. Take a map of the zoo, to e found at the entrance, and don't miss the new area of the zoo",
          "We found out after we went that there is a free bus from the centre of Copenhagen which is great because it's not well signposted if you're walking. Its a lovely zoo and when we went (spring) there were also lots of baby animals. They are building a panda enclosure for 2018.",
          "We walked to the zoo from the Carlsberg Experience. It sits in a large parkland. The zoo was well laid out and easy to get about. Being one of the first hot days, there were lots of people but not crowded. The animals were easy to see and were up and about or eating. It took",
          "The Polar Bear part of the Zoo is pretty cool. I've been to lots of zoo's globally - and Singapore Zoo is hands down the best. However, I dont recall seeing Polar Bears at Singapore zoo, but it might be because Copenhagen is a cold location!",
          "We had a great time exploring the zoo with our young kids. The wagon was very helpful for kids. My son did not want to leave the playground with bunnies and goat area. The restaurant was also very good.",
          "We really loved this place. Many animals! There were even bats! Really nice green and clean zoo. Different monkeys, birds and lizzards. There was also kids zoo-cute small rabbits. Recommend to visit!",
          "Glad to visit CPH zoo, the animals are full of energy even the day we visited was a raining day. Happy to see polar bears and sea otters! The food in the zoo was also good with a reasonable piece, staffs are friendly.",
          "Because of the Copenhagen card we were granted a free access to the zoo. Honestly otherwise the ticket would be too expensive imo(180 DKK). There quite large collection of animals there. The experience was overall quite fun and you could even pet some of the animals.",
          "A wonderful zoo, which has good set of animals like, polar bear, different species of monkey, Tiger, eel, Indian elephant etc",
          "We really enjoyed our trip here. Just enough large exhibits with the must see animals, and just enough smaller exhibits with animals I'd never seen before. I love hippos and I was impressed with the hippo enclosure. I also enjoyed the very large number of baby animals throughout",
          "Me and my partner visited this zoo last weekend. Its a very large zoo, with loads of animals. Personally our favourite were the otters, they were full of character and very playful bless them. Also they have polar bears which I've never seen at a zoo in England, although they",
          "This zoo must be one of the best zoos I have ever visited! I visited this zoo because of the free access with Copenhagen Card. It was a huge zoo where I could find a wide range of animal species. Didn't expect that I could even see polar bear in this trip! I had a great time",
          "I am not a huge fan of zoos and visited this one as it was part of the Copenhagen Card. The zoo was large and the amiable had adequate space to move around! As we approached the zoo through the park we could already see the elephants and were quite surprised by this! It was",
          "The main reason I visited the ZOO was the Arctic ring. The polar bear was a bit sleepy as he was after lunch. The seals were fun as they were constantly swimming or posing on a rock. Penguins were lovely. The tropical part (tropical forest or how was it called) was great as",
          "This zoo made our Easter trip. Best zoo enjoyed by my whole family. The polar bears were amazing , as was the monkeys . Very well priced too spent the whole day here. Toilets , food stalls very clean and well stocked. Also there is a wooden to climb. It's a long climb worth it",
          "I had a wonderful time, loved the setup. Animals looked happy and weather was excellent for lots of beautiful photo ops.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to Copenhagen Zoo. You can see most of the exotic animals here which was nice. The Safari area was best where giraffes, zebras and rhino can live on the same area. There is also a great viewing place above the are that you really see them. New",
          "Spent about 3 hours here with the wife and 2 young teenagers. It was better than I thought it would be, but like most zoos I have visited it created mixed feelings about seeing animals in captivity. The highlights were the polar bears and the the baby hippo. The only gripe I",
          "Free entry with Our Copenhagen cards so not sure how much it would have cost without them. Really easy to navigate zoo, when we arrived we hired a pull along trailer for our toddler which he acted like a king in for most of the day! One of the best features was the animals",
          "Really enjoyed our day at the Zoo. I've been to a few, but you can really see the effort Copenhagen has put into being family friendly. Lots of animals, wide paths, lots of play areas for the kids. One of the best features was the option to hire a pull-cart / trolley, which the",
          "If your looking for something to do hungover that isn't too strenuous but gets you out the house and stops you from spending the day feeling sorry for yourself and stewing in your own filth I can recommend the zoo. They have a polar bear and flamingo's, two of my favourite",
          "Free entry with Copenhagen card. Best zoo I have been to. Large premises with large enclosures and animals did not look sad or unhappy (which I have seen in other zoos). Wide variety of species and different types of exhibit which kept my interest (we were here over 3 hours).",
          "We wanted to visit Copenhagen Zoo as they had Polar Bears, as couldn\u2019t really think of anywhere else close by we had have the opportunity and had heard that they had access to a super large purpose built enclosure. We had a nice easy bus ride from close to the Main station out",
          "Good zoo however we were disappointed on how small some of the enclosures were, especially for the big cats. Being so close to the animals was good though. Baboons were great! We were fortunate enough to get to hold the mice in the \"children zoo\" section.",
          "I visited here with my son. Take bus 6A from central station. Entry included with Copenhagen Card. All the standard animals here - lions, elephants (only a few as enclosure under building work), giraffes etc. Enclosures all reasonable size. Polar Bear (could only see one) was",
          "Another Copenhagen Card adventure started at the zoo which set across a large space. The zoo mixes historical exhibits alongside the animal enclosures. We especially enjoyed the importance of elephants across different cultures. The play area and hearding animals(where petting",
          "Nice way to spend a half day. You can see animals from close. Zoo is near to city, so we walked there and back.",
          "Free with a CPH card. Its a 20min walk through the park from visit Carlsberg. The had beautiful animals - the hippos, lions and elephant were beautiful to watch. Food at the zoo is pricey.",
          "The zoo is located a little outside the centre of Copenhagen. We cycled to it which was very easy as there is a cycle path the whole way and only took about 15 mins. There is plenty of indoor parts which was great considering the weather wasn't the best the day we went! Also",
          "The zoo is laid out very well and divided mainly in different zones Tropical, Asian, Nordics and African. Animals in the zoo seemed well fed and active and we were able to spot almost every animal in the zoo with closed proximity. There are small ice cream shops and coffee",
          "I can say one of the best Zoo I seen in my life. We were a couple walking around and enjoyed all the time spent in the zoo. There are sone dedicated areas for children so we tried to avoid it :) Good thing that you can see animals from all possible aspect: under the water, on",
          "I visited this Zoo on the 12th of March. I looked forward to this for most of the weekend and was very disappointed when we entered. I am glad I did not pay the Zoo direct (we had Copenhagen cards) as I would not of been happy knowing I was funding this. 90% of the animals",
          "My family visited this place and loved it (see pictures). It worth spending half day watching diverse animals in a cold place like Kopenhavn. It was May2016. Well treated animals, snakes, bears, felines and very easy to find this place. You can use public transport, Uber or taxi.",
          "My wife and I popped here earlier this week. It was a cold grey day so was very quiet and we could spend a leisurely few hours wandering around. It is fairly compact and easily walked. What impressed me most was that all the animals looked healthy, they were mostly up and",
          "We like this zoo! A lot of animals. We spend there 4 hours. The announcements about animal's feeding time let you see small shows.",
          "It's alright and most of the animals seems to be living a great life - however, some of them live in very small places compared to their sizes.. It's really horrible to watch. Besides that, we enjoyed our trip there. The food is expensive, but we expected that. Some of the",
          "This is one of the greatest zoos I've ever been to. You could see majority of the animals inside and outside. The zoo accommodates for both. Even though it was raining and cold it didn't put a damper on the day, it was great to see the animals had a lot of space to roam around.",
          "This is a nice zoo: easy to walk around and animals were viewed even in the cold. The design of the zoo meant that animals could be seen indoors and outside. The animals spaces were clean and of a reasonable size. The only draw back was the lunch in the restaurant. Very average",
          "Visited this lovely zoo on the edge of Copenhagen. It's got a really good layout and good collection of animals in thoughtful settings. We went on a really rainy day in Feb 2017 and the zoo has a good mix of alternating indoors and outdoors stuff which keeps giving the",
          "This is one of the better zoos that I have been to and was definitely worth a visit. Entry was with the Copenhagen Card. I read that the zoo has reduced the number of animals on display to give more space to others which shows as there were no animals that felt they were in not",
          "I got to pet plenty of goats and walk amongst kangaroos, so I was instantly happy! Copenhagen Zoo is excellent. It clearly looks after its animals (though the polar bear doesn't seem happy, but they don't do well in captivity) and the enclosures as well designed that you can",
          "This is a great little zoo with plenty to see and do. All of the animals look amazingly well cared for and happy - they clearly have a very successful breeding programme as there were plenty of young and I presume that is a good sign of well cared for animals. The polar bear is",
          "Loved this zoo so much we went back a second day (free entry with a Copenhagen card).There is so much to see and do and plenty of places to stop and rest.The gift shop wasn't too expensive either.",
          "The weather may have been cold, but the warmth of the Zoo and their enclosures and happy animals kept us smiling! The layout is quite small but easy to find your way round, the enclosures didn't feel restricting for their residents. The Animals felt really accessible. I would",
          "It\u2019s the most visited Zoo and the 4th most visited attraction in Copenhagen and for very good reason. The Zoo is a fantastic place to get extremely close to literally hundreds of different animals. Most of the exhibits have such low walls it constantly plays on your mind that",
          "Put your warm clothes on and enjoy this zoo. It is not that big but it is certainly not boring. It is also nice to see that the animals are treated nice.",
          "As someone who loves going to zoos, I have been to many already and Copenhagen was one of the best! Many of the enclosures have been upgraded recently to make them bigger and copy the animals natural habitat. The information areas about the animals are great, modern and make",
          "Just outside to centre of Copenhagen this is a good way to see more and spend a pleasant half day. Compared to other zoos this seemed more spread out. They have obviously modernist some parts which made others seem tired. The animals looked well cared for. In the grounds there",
          "We had a great time at Copenhagen zoo. The animals enclosures here are very well maintained and spacious compared to other inner city zoo i have visited. In particular we enjoyed the Polar Bear enclosure which is the best i have ever seen, most active Polar Bear i have ever",
          "I went to this zoo in January 2017 and enjoyed it. Some of the enclosures were empty but the ones we saw we entertaining. The penguins are great fun as was the sea lion doing lots of tricks with his trainer. There's a fair bit of walking around but it's great to see lions,",
          "My First Zoo outside of India, so might be little biased with my review as one the best I have visited so far. Loved the Animals and varieties for Monkeys they have! liked the way the Building was made for Polar Bear and Elephants. Liked that there were not only Animals but also",
          "There is an adult/children section and a children's section. My children love going to their side and petting the cows, climbing into the goat exhibit, hiding food for the pigs and then watching the pigs search with determination their food. We have gone into the bird enclosure",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is not the biggest one but still quite nice for a few hours to walk around and look at the animals. Perfect for a family day out with kids.",
          "Spend the day in Copenhagen zoo, bring some sandwiches and spend a day at the zoo. Plenty of places to eat b.y.o lunch or buy your food inside the zoo, it's in the high spending end.",
          "This place has a lovely atmosphere and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I was just leaving the otters when one staff member approached me and suggested I stayed as she was about to feed them. There was a running commentary although it was not in English, great to",
          "Excellent choice and array of animals on show. Great destination for kids and adults alike. One of the better European zoos ive been to.",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is located far from the center of the city. It is better to arrive there with a public transport. It is one of the oldest zoos in Europe, from the 19th century. It has some services like restaurants or shops, where you can eat or drink, or buy something. We came",
          "I was very nervous to take my girlfriend to Copenhagen zoo, as she is very concerned about animal captivity and their conditions in zoos. Having read the reviews, I was expecting sad animals and poor enclosures, but this was not really the case. On the whole I feel the",
          "It was so cold when we visited that we only managed a couple of hours. It was so cold, even the Polar bear wasn't playing out. The entrance fee was included on the pre paid 'Copenhagen Card' which we just showed on the day. We really enjoyed the Lions and the bat enclosure. My",
          "It was one great zoo with a large variety of animals, even kangaroos.. I think the attraction is the polish bear that gets in the water all the time !!",
          "Nice zoo, but not very special. We enjoyed the zoo on january 1., it is not very cheap. The animale do not have big habits. Would be one of the oldest zoo's in Europe, but the atmosphere is not special. Allthough okay to spend a few hours.",
          "We went on a family trip here largely because it was the only thing open on New Years Day. What a mistake as we came away appalled. The animals are in tiny enclosures and it's frankly darn right cruelty. The ennui of the animals was plain to see especially the lions. I bet the",
          "The animals seemed sad. The enclosures are far too small, the polar bears paced back and forth on the same spot for hours and were clearly in distress. Would not visit again.",
          "Great place to take the kids. You can get a lot closer to the animals than in a lot of zoos. Lots of walking but very rewarding.",
          "This place was a disgrace. I saw the polar bear doing the same movement over and over and over and over again. I stood there for 30 min, and he did exactly the same movements. Elephants were also terribly sad and doing repeated movements as well. This place is a big NOPE.",
          "Went with a friend to Copenhagen...planned a visit to Zoo...bought a Copenhagen Card for 53 Euros...entitles you to travel for 24 hrs on all modesof transport including metro and intercity trains...free entry to a lot of must see places including the zoo.. so I saved a lot of",
          "This is the best zoo I have ever visited. MY dream came true - to see the giraffes. But also everything else was wonderful - so versatile and exotic zoo! Totally worth it. I only felt sad for the flamingos because they were very cold in the Nordic autumn weather, and one of the",
          "ZOO with long walks and the animals are still far away - You dont really see the animals in their eyes.",
          "My children really enjoyed the zoo, and we spent nearly a full day there. It seemed fairly quiet, we didn't see that many people whilst we were there, which does make a change from other zoos we have visited in the past! The polar bears were a highlight for my children.",
          "Love this place, a super zoo were they really is working to improve the welfare of their animals and work in the field to preserve and protect the habitat and and the animals. Super service minded people working there",
          "Quite a small zoo but well thought out, polar bears , brown bears and otters a highlight, family friendly. Arrive early to secure parking nearby, previous booking not necessary for zoo.",
          "This zoo is one of the best I have been in. It is large, with two sections joining together via an underground tunnel. I was particularly impressed with the polar bear. There is also a high tower that you can climb to the top to get an amazing view of the entire zoo. I would",
          "I think this place shoul be more famous. It is enormous and has a lot of attraction, unice animals and interactive items to enjoy. It is great place and all the animals looked calm and not under stress. In some of the areas you can be literally surrounded by animals. This is my",
          "Very nice \ud83d\udc4d. Plenty of animals, clean and central located. My kid loved the zoo. A couple of playgrounds, some cafes, ice kiosks ant etc. Had a nice time, spent all day to see everything \ud83d\ude48. And they have little goats, that you can go to and see it closer or touch :)",
          "We went on a Saturday in late October. The zoo has a wide variety of animals, is clean and very relaxing. Well maintained. Places to purchase food or to sit and bring your own. Not far away are the Cisterns which is also an interesting place.",
          "Visiting a zoo in winter will always be a different experience from summer so we spent our last day in Copenhagen visiting this zoo and had a really good time. As it was November some of the animals were not in there outside area and the enclosures were either being repaired on",
          "Nothing special, actually. If you stay longer in Copenhagen, has worth to visit with kids. Giant Pandas will arrive in year 2017!!!!",
          "I have been in different zoos in Europe (Berlin, Prague) and I can confirm that also this zoo is very interesting and great designed for children and families. I visited this zoo with my husband and 4-years old son. He is a big animal lover and appreciates interesting places and",
          "went with the Copenhagen card it was in the afternoon the fact that it wasn't big the kids enjoyed it we liked",
          "We visited the zoo on a cold and drizzly day but still had a good time and saw everything except for the Red Pandas which were obviously hiding because of the weather!",
          "Adult ticket is rather expensive (170 DKK; 24 e) but it is worth of every penny. Kids (3-11 years) ticket is 95 DKK; 13 e). I have to say that this is one of the best Zoos I have ever visited. You can closely see animals and they are active. There are also animals which you",
          "We went in May 2016. Wife, me and daughter. The enclosures for the animals are very close to the public, I have been to quite a few and the Copenhagen zoo is by far the best if you want to view the animals nearly up close and personal. It was the first time we saw a polar bear",
          "Visited the currently very autumnally-dressed zoo today with my partner using our Copenhagen cards. The card was easy to use and we were in very quickly. A great zoo, in our opinion. Visually it is a pretty zoo and the layout is easy to follow and a good representation of each",
          "Visited the zoo at opening time on a Saturday morning. The Copenhagen Card allowed us free entry and also free transport to and from the zoo using bus 6A from central station. There is a fantastic variety of animals here and we had a brilliant time. The animal\u2019s enclosures",
          "Took a trip here with my husband on our first visit to Copenhagen. It is probably a medium sized zoo and you couples comfortably get around and see everything in about 2-3 hours depending if there are children with you. Some of my favourite animals were the polar bear, the",
          "Good place to see plenty of cute, fun and dangerous animals. The polar bear came close and it was amazing to see such a great animal. There were also a lot of educational and fun games.",
          "We went to the zoo on a cloudy morning, hoping it wouldn't rain. The majority of the exhibits are outside, naturally, so it was good it didn't end up raining! The map provided was great for getting around the zoo. Interesting to see one part of the zoo on the other side of",
          "Wonderful amount of animals and a great variety. Haven't seen hippos and polar bears in a zoo in a while.",
          "First visit to the new Tasmania area. Great to be able to get a bit closer to the kangaroos, and while you can't interact with the animals, the children get a real thrill out of the experience. The best outside of Tasmania itself.",
          "Family program! Great collection of animals including my favorites, the polar bear and Tasmanian devil. The animals areas are clean and they looks very weel trated . Nice place to do a picnic.",
          "The zoo was amazing it's just fascinating because there was majestic and phenomenal animals. And the noucternal animals like the poision dart frog and the armadillo and the anaconda. There were these like weird and exotic animals and unbeleivable dangerous animals like the",
          "The zoo is awesome! My kid absolutely love it! I love everything about the zoo especially the claw machine let you play until you get one so my kid was excited about that:)",
          "Easy to reach from the city by bike. Great collection of animals mostly who seem fairly happy, although I felt sorry for the snowy owl as he needed a much higher flying space and looked cross. Nice picnic areas and cafes, lovely to visit and see animals such as the polar bear,",
          "The animals were so beautiful. Visitors got to pet the camels, get face to face with polar bears, walk in the same open space as kangaroos etc. I loved how close we can get to the animals whilst still feeling a sense of security.",
          "Spent a couple of hours one afternoon at the zoo. Very easy to take the bus to the zoo. Good collection of animals from all over the world, Elephants, Bears, Seals, and many more.",
          "We spent only a few hoursthere and concentrated, almost exclusively, on the Arctic section. Other than the polar bear hiding from us, the animals did not disappoint. The brown bears, reindeer, and wolves played in their enclosure, entertaining their visitors. It was raining, so",
          "I've visited tons of zoo across Europe and this is my favourite. It's beautifully laid out, the architecture and artwork is wonderful and some of the new immersive exhibits are superb. I know it has had a couple of controversial moments of late but you can always tell the",
          "Copenhagen ZOO is one of the best I visited and I have to say that I have visited couple of them around the world. In Copenhagen ZOO you have a chance to visit some of the animals directly in their \"cage\" which increase the experience. If you love animlas or you just want to",
          "We love animals and zoos. We make it a point to visit zoos when we go on vacation and have seen many, many in the United States and Europe. The Copenhagen Zoo stacks up nicely when compared to their peers and we loved our day at the zoo today. We visited on an absolutely",
          "We really enjoyed this zoo, quite a few areas need to be modernised and a few enclosures are archaically small but as a whole it us a wonderful day out. I'd highly recommend.",
          "Surely one of the best zoos in the world. Yes, it's heart wrenching to see some of the animals in enclosures clearly not suitable by modern standards and to read about the culling of healthy lions and giraffes in order to maintain a sustainable population. Its clear that",
          "Copenhagen zoo is one of Copenhagen's best attractions and the location around several parks is just wonderful. You will find the entrance fee rather high compared to other zoo's in many other countries, but you will also find a place where animals are treated well and with",
          "So pretty and well laid out. Elephants and polar bear were the highlights for me. We visited with our teens aged 13 and 17, but perfect for couples families with younger kids too. Excellent facilities (toilets/ice creams etc) and very clean.",
          "I'm sorry to give you such a poor rating but as much as I enjoyed the experience of actually seeing these magnificent animals I was disturbed by their lack of space, especially the larger animals. The elephants looked especially distressed just waiting by the door to their",
          "Some areas are exciting, like the section devoted to the elephants and the one to the kangaroos. Some others leaves you with a question mark: where did the polar bear go? As for the insects? Not for those with phobias: different kinds of butterflies fly above your head and",
          "The zoo appears a little run down with a view of the exhibition currently worked on. Still worth a visit. Combined it on the Copenhagen card, which was excellent8value for money",
          "We visited the zoo specifically to see the Arctic and Scandinavian animals (reindeer, wolves, brown bears, seals and polar bears). The zoo is quite small but there are obvious ongoing improvements to the enclosures. The polar bear was by far the star attraction. Beware that",
          "We enjoyed the day. Some of the compounds are under refurbishment so some of the larger animals were in smaller temporary accommodation. You could easily pass a day here",
          "What an excellent Zoo, especially compared to the American zoos. This one seemed so accessible and easy to enjoy the animals. There wasn't layers and layers of security fences in the way or obstructing your view. The animals were out and very playful. Currently they are working",
          "Magnificente zoo. Very good conditions for the animals . Very clean . Nice views to the animals. You feell like in paradise with the buterflies flying around uso in the interior garden. I really Believe that they care about the animals.",
          "The zoo is great and vast. It has something for everyone from rare to the big beasts to animal bothering for kids. The newer enclosures are amazing and clearly well though out for both the animals and public allowing some incredibly close encounters with animals in what, at",
          "Today I spent a nice few hours in the zoo, it was nice and clean. The staff was so polite and helpful. For me the polar bear was the best it is nice watching it swimming and playing in water.",
          "We visited on a rainy day, but it was still fun. A highlight is the chance to walk around with the kangaroos. There is some construction going on, so it got a little messy at times.",
          "I watched a program about the Copenhagen Zoo saying how different they were doing nowadays, adapting the zoo to the animal needs and I went to see it with my own eyes. Don't go there expecting to see the animals to please you, go to see them being themselves: felines are feed",
          "This zoo is one of the nicest I have been to. There is a great range of animals from lions and tigers to elephants and giraffes and everything in between. The polar bear was wonderful and all of the animals looked well cared for and happy in lovely surroundings. This made a",
          "I've been to many zoos in my life, and this is probably my favourite. It is home to many beautiful animals and I found the layout and presentation really well thought out and it makes this a great place to visit.",
          "This was the top experience when on holidays in Copenhagen. Had no idea really what to expect when we went there. First of all it was only a quick bus ride, about ten minutes from city center. When we arrived, we thought the prices where on the bit stiff side, but after being",
          "I loved to see the polar bear...the chimps and to walk around, exploring this fantastic place. An exotic oasis in Copenhagen! At the Zoo's store I've purchased a funny ape's mask and dared to walk around, becoming the center of attention for a while. It was funny to see that",
          "Visited the zoo on a rainy day, this was a mistake, overall the zoo is very good and lots to see but not a lot if shelter when raining. Did clear up later and the rest of the day was great.",
          "Great zoo, easy to reach via bus from the centre, lots to do, prices very reasonable. Lots of different animals",
          "very good zoo and must visit for children. Very nice plan and you wont miss anything. Really good food also :)",
          "As part of our visit Copenhagen theme we visited the Copenhagen Zoo, and a treat it was! Plenty of animals to see. My children played with the goats and were so taken with the playful seals and majestic zebras, tigers and elephants. A real treat for a family's day out.",
          "This has been the saddest zoo I have ever visited. We went because it was a free attraction if you had the copenhagen card. It is well designed for tourist to really see the animals very close. We were impressed by the polar bears and the lions. You can see the distress these",
          "We spent the day at the zoo with the kids. Great place, super well organised and a lot of different types of animals. We had a good time, enjoyed a picnic in the elephant area, and had the chance to see a polar bear, up close and personal!",
          "if you really visited everything worth seeing in copenhagen then you can give a chance..the entrance fee is crazy expensive( nearly 26 dollars) so think twice.. bring your snacks with you..the restaurants inside are also quite expensive..you can be in touch with the domestic",
          "This is a great zoo with a lot of really interesting animals. Some of our favourites were the Tasmanian Devils, the Armadillo, and the Polar Bear. All of the animals seem to have good enclosures with good views for the public. This zoo has a large variety of animals and is",
          "It wasn't the best of days to visit the zoo - lots of rain showers forecast. But what can you do when you only have a limited window to visit all the must-do attractions? I have read that Denmark is really kid-friendly, which I think is quite accurate, and of course one would",
          "We visited the zoo on a Copenhagen weekend recently. There's a free shuttle bus to and from the Zoo so be sure to take advantage of that. Booking online helped skip some large queues as well! The zoo is pretty large but we went round it in around three hours, and that including",
          "Animals look decently treated, which is the first thing that should be a concern to anyone. The zoo is decently-sized so plan ahead a lot of walking and easily 4 hours if you are there with kids. Good variety of animals.",
          "Wonderful Place to visit in Copenhagen. Though the entrance fee is bit expensive, its worth visiting the zoo. We had a family trip and we were able to cover almost all the areas of the zoo. Its very clean and they are maintaining the zoo very well. Kids play area is an added",
          "I have been to many zoos in Europe so this won't be on top of your list. But there is a fine variety of animals, they seem to have enough place to move around. There are polar bears and penguins, animals from Africa, tigers and so on. Unfortunately we couldn't find snake pits",
          "We visited on what appeared to be a sunny day but soon turned to rain. The zoo had many areas to get away from rain. We saw a lot of school children who benefited from this. Staff helpful and informative telling us about new animals a panda in the near future. Facilities were",
          "Im not a big zoo fan but this one was excellent - large clean and varied. Full range of animals and ability to get up close especially the lions. They were very characterful. We saw elephants during feeding time which was interesting to watch and the giraffes are always worth",
          "If you are going to keep big animals in captivity, then Copenhagen does the best of a bad job. I'm torn between the ethics surrounding conservation and keeping animals away from their natural habitat and so I enter zoo's believing i'm likely to be upset by some of what I see. To",

          "Very easy to reach on the bus, (eg 15 mins from Norrebro station). Reasonable entry cost. Opens 10am to 8pm. Take in a picnic like the locals. Two polar bears with underwater tunnel viewing-see them first as active first thing in the day. (We circled back to them at 3pm and they",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the Copenhagen Zoo. There are many large and small animals with a great elephant exhibit. I also saw a Tazmanian Devil for the first time which was neat. There is also a rather large hippo exhibit too. It has two parts on separate sides of the road. It took",
          "My boyfriend and I visited Copenhagen Zoo in March, and it was such a great day out! We got extremely lucky, it was really sunny the day we went so every animal in the place was out. It was so clean, and wasn't too busy or crowded at all. Food and gifts from the gift shop were",
          "Took a train from Sweden to Copenhagen, then got onto a free bus to the zoo. I was able to buy tickets on the bus and skip the lines. Had a enjoyable experience, got to see the animals during their feeding times. I even got a pet a camel!",

          "Very green place where to stroll even without looking at the animals. Though well maintained, the zoo is definitely old, some cages small and sad, but the animals seem quite healthy. Many little stops for children, with funny questions or playing areas. Acceptable junk food, ice",

          "If the weather is good, spend your day in the Copenhagen Zoo - your children will love it! It`s modern, interactive, clean, with more than 3000 animals. The Arctic Ring is great - we enjoyed the swimming and juggling of the polar bears above and below water surface. There is",
          "as part of our red bus tour, we got dropped off here and since we had heard so much about it for all the wrong reasons, we decided to go and see it in person! the zoo is quite open actually... you have a variety of animals here and from across the world. i really enjoyed",
          "We were here several years earlier, and unfortunately only had the time to tour half of it. On our visit this year, we made sure to allow enough time to be able to visit the entire zoo. It certainly is worthwhile to be able to do this. If you are a visitor to the area, maybe",
          "Bringing children to Copenhagen for a few days calls for a visit to the zoo. It is a fabulous place with interesting architecture, visible animal welfare and vast collection of species. It's educational, entertaining and very exciting to walk around all day. We saw the",
          "This zoo is a little out of the main area but it is a wonderful experience from being less that a foot away from a lot of the animals to walking past them in the enclosure it is a sight to see. You can take the whole family and experience a horde of things and all the animals",
          "Visited with my girlfriend just after the polar bears moved in to their new artic circle home. We both love animals and it was awesome to see them up close- you can walk in a tunnel under the water section of their enclosure and there are loads of great viewing spots. Feeding",

          "We had a great time visiting the Copenhagen Zoo. It is an easy size park to complete in half a day or take a full day to enjoy every inch of the place. They have a wonderful layout and a wide variety of animals to see. It was easy getting to the park on the city bus. Best part",
          "Kobenhavn zoo is well maintained and well constructed place. You can see that the place has been designed with families in mind. There are several play areas that inspire climing, moving and being creative. There is for example a possibility to walk into a kangaroos area. There",
          "A pity the weat wasn't perfect, but the day a success. We ate at the barbecue buffet, which served lovely meats and was child friendly. Had pasta and different things our three-year-old loved. A plus that they had raisins and dried apricots which was perfect snack. A bit sad",
          "We used our Copenhagen Cards for easy travel by bus #26 which let us out at the Zoo Entrance. The Copenhagen card also covered our entrance fee into the zoo. The easy directions provided by the zoo allowed us to have time to tour the Carlesburg Brewery. While at the zoo we",

          "We really enjoyed visiting Copenhagen Zoo and got round in just under five hours, which includes stopping for lunch. We've visited many zoos before and would like to mention a lot of excellent points for this zoo, as well as where improvements could be made. We ate in Konnilds",
          "I think zoo are sad places. Generally I do not like them. I went just because I wanted to bring my 4 yo kid and I have to say that the zoo is very well maintained, clean and the animals do not look sad (it appears). For sure arctic bears an seals enjoy this climate... not sure",

          "This venue is included in our Copenhagen Card. The wait to get in was almost 25 minutes, and I arrived 20 minutes after they opened. This is a family zoo. Crowded with children. The animal exhibits were fine, not modern, but not oppressive. They are making changes, as most",

          "We had a few hours to spare and took the trip to the Zoo. Although the enclosures for some of the animals didn't seem large enough, I can honestly say the animals seemed far more happy and interactive than I've seen in most zoos. The elephants were playing with big balls that",
          "We had a great time here, especially since the weather was great and the park wasn't to busy. I've been to a lot of zoo's and concerning the animals it wasn't very special, but still fun.",
          "Firstly - getting the bus out to the zoo is a breeze. The zoo itself had a good mix of animals and the enclosures (on the whole) seemed reasonable. Highlights were the otters, polar bears, seals, baby brown bears and penguins. There are a few food choices abd lots of seating all",

          "We did have a really great day out here. The emphasis seems to be on fewer animals but with a concentration on quality, especially in the environments they are given . Hence you will see Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Elephants, Giraffes, Zebras, Hippos, Rhinos, Polar Bears, Brown",
          "The zoo at Copenhagen was a wonderful experience the highlights were seeing 8 lions resting, brown bear cubs playing and the best bit watching the polar bear swim which was a delight. The zoo is well laid out and is easy to get to from Central Copenhagen",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is so far the best zoo I have seen, and I have visited quite a few - the fencing/cages are big, and the animals seem well cared for. The garden itself is a well maintained mix of plants, flowers, new and old buildings. So, if you are not put off by the notion of",
          "Well laid out, clean zoo with more emphasis on the animals care than on selling merchandise. Fair amount of work going on in the zoo but all seems to be for the improvement / evolution of enclosures. All of the animals appeared content. The lions, tigers and polar bears are",
          "Earlier wasn't sure that it would make sense since i don't have a kid but i was wrong. .it was amazing in every sense and the most adventurous part was lions and tigers in open and no fencing around. Great delight to watch polar bear too. Great fun",

          "Lots of zoos are similar, and this one doesn't particularly stray from the others. However, there are lots of animals at this zoo that you wouldn't tend to find at other zoos, for example wolves, bears, elephants and polar bears. It was relatively easy to find your way around,",
          "A visit to Copenhagen ZOO is an all day visit, this is a fantastic place but make sure to visit in summer. the have a big area for kids, we choose to bring our own food because food in main attractions food are expensive, and besides this is the perfect place for at picknic. you",
          "With all Zoo's there is a sense of tragedy attached to it but as zoo goes, this is a charming one. There are lots of different and majestic animals to see - elephants, rhinos, lions, tigers.. We enjoyed the day and the children of course can't see the issues about captivity so",
          "Must visit the Zoo, organised, clean and easy to get around, nice experience. Seal Show : Worth watching, they were great and a good laugh Habitats were very likewise, which was good too see! Best things to do is definitely : go to see the Elephants, being this close to",
          "We visited the zoo, but were saddened to see how small some enclosures were and the animals did not look happy. The male elephant was stepping back and forth constantly, A Leopard was also pacing back and forth unnaturally. We watched the brown bear do loops of his pen repeating",
          "During our visit a lot of work seemed to be taking place in some of the enclosures. The elephant area and Arctic area were well worth a visit and I am sure once the work is complete this will be an excellent attraction. The animals seemed in good condition and on the whole",
          "We visited the zoo in Copenhagen with or two young children (9 and 7) and had a great day. The zoo is located a short bus ride from the city centre and is free to enter with the excellent value Copenhagen card. The exhibits are well maintained and modern and include easy",
          "Compared to the zoos we are used to in England, the enclosures were extremely small for the animals. We did have a good day and looked at all the animals but couldn't help feeling sorry for them, especially such as the polar bears, lions and tigers. They sold really yummy",
          "We arrived just as the zoo was opening and were worried that it might get really busy. Thankfully it is so well spaced out that we ended up seeing lots of the animals on our own! Shop and cafe were great too!",
          "Since our Copenhagen Card permitted us a free entry, we decided to visit this zoo. We took probably 4-5 hours to walk through everything + climbing to the viewing tower to snap some photos. The zoo is some way from the closest train station, but the bus stop (6A) is right in",
          "When we visited, one of the monkeys had unfortunately died. The other monkeys were carrying him around as apart of the grieving process. Whilst I completely understand this, maybe a sign before you got to the enclosure might have been a good idea as it was upsetting to see",
          "My husband and I spent a whole Monday during Easter break at the zoo, along with our toddler. He absolutely loved the elephants, bears, lions and tigers. He was fascinated by the otters as well. And I think we enjoyed the zoo as much as he did. The feeding time was amazing. The",

          "It seems they still working in the zoo to expand it. We could not see the Polar bear in its large complex. Only thing we liked is the glass island cage for the Hippo.",
          "Even the tickets are a bit expensive it's lovely spending a day in Copenhagen Zoo. Many animals to watch and they are in nice surroundings. Many nice places where you can buy or eat your picnic. Places like a savannah, zoo for the children where they can pet the animals, a \"rain",
          "We had a great time here. The zoo is packed full of exotic animals and you feel like you're very close to them. Enclosures seem spacious which is nice and animals well cared for. Food and drink reasonably priced. Teddy bear grabbing machines app round the zoo and we ended up",
          "I had a brilliant time at the zoo but the day we were there most of the enclosures were being cleaned and you couldn't see a number of animals. Other than that everything was great.. Made my day that when I walked into the giraffe house one of the giraffes came up to me and",
          "One of the best zoos in Europe...The zoo in Vienna is the best I've visited in Europe and I'd say the Copenhagen zoo comes second. It has a very good collection of animals and some rare species...Was my first time to see the okapi, the tapir and few other...Playing with the",

          "We went to the zoo on a beautiful Sunny Monday, and although it was OK we were quite disappointed that some animals were missing and the place felt like it was on shut down. It was a little disappointing and think the zoo should consider a Winter entry price, as I'm sure you get",
          "My boyfriend and me went to visti the zoo in May. May is still very cold in Copenhagen so many animals were hibernating. My favourite atraction was prairie dogs, It is a small zoo compare to the one where I live (Madrid) But it gives the feeling that the animal are freer.",
          "There were some enclosures which seemed far too small for animals such as the lions. But the elephant house and Arctic ring were really impressive. Nice day out but seeing the lack of space for some animals was a bit sad, can only hope they are well looked after.",
          "We went on a very quiet day, there seemed to be either animals missing that were shown on the map or they were being moved. The first thing you see is lions in an enclosure that is by no means big enough for them. The Penguins had no water. The chimps were brilliant and the",
          "it is ok to visit the zoo but do not have high expectations on this place. It is nice though but it is not a must, if you ask my opinion. The kids were ok with it,",
          "This is a smaller zoo to walk around.. However small zoo = small enclosures for the animals. Monkeys were great to watch but the lions look quite depressed there must be around 7-8 in the enclosure and it is not big at all.. I can see work being done to the zoo so hopefully they",
          "We enjoyed visiting the zoo in Copenhagen. Great variety of animals to see over the course of two parks. The park is slightly date I would agree though we didn't see any unhappy animals. Favourite part for us was seeing the giraffe enclosure. Decent day out for the whole family",
          "First of all, I have real concerns about the size of some of the enclosures. The lions, with several cubs, seemed to have no room to run, all the stimulation we could see were a few Christmas trees tossed in the enclosure (in fact in all enclosures). A lot of the animals were",
          "We used our Copenhagen Card to get entrance to the zoo and enjoyed seeing the polar bears playing outside with their large plastic oil drums and swimming in a large and varied pool. It was a lovely sunny day when we visited so all of the animals were outside enjoying the",
          "We didn't spend long at the zoo as we felt many of the enclosures were too small or lacked activity for the animals within, with some of the animals visibly shivering due to the cold temperatures and no way for them to stay warm.",
          "Perhaps I am spoiled from other zoos, but the Copenhagen Zoo is is a step back in time - and that's not meant in a quaint and charming way. The enclosures were small, the animals seemed dreadfully unhappy - to the point I found the condition of the elephants disturbing. Large",
          "Very well laid out and interesting zoo with daily activity schedule (penguin feeding, polar bear feeding etc). Particularly liked the Tasmanian devils, capybaras, giraffes, elephants, polar bears, penguins, tropical birds etc. It was a very wet day when we visited but there"

When we came the line was huge, and even when we had prepaid tickets we waited in line for about half an hour. It would be desirable to make the entrance to the Zoo more easy accessible.",

          "Really enjoyed the visit with my family tho not a big zoo but really good place to see once.",
          "Fun day trip for the kids. Its a pretty contained area so you can easily cover it in a day. We usually don\u2019t go to zoos because my kids worry about how the animals are treated or confined in places where they are not meant to be. But this \u2026",

          "In all honsty after reading the raving reviews i was hoping to see a zoo were i don't feel sorry for the animals.

          "VERY FUN although they used to keep humans",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the zoo, but I thought some of the enclosures seemed a little small for what was in them (that could just be my conceptions from previous zoo's I've been to though). Would be a nice place to take kids, but as an adult \u2026",
          "So many animals in amazing kennels. The pandas were amazing and the resturant inside the panda exhibition was very pleasant with tasty food and good prices. Thank you for this amazing day :)",

          "First zoo experience out of US and I wish our zoos were this great! Make time to go here if you are visiting.",
          "Seldom would I recommend visiting a zoo to go to a restaurant however this is the exception. The food was presented immaculately attractively on the plate and the taste matched it  . There is clearly a talented chef at work here! Very much worth the visit whilst you are spending a day at the zoo.",
          "A perfect place to visit especially with the kids. Zoo has very big numbers of animals from all around the world. There are lots of food places and playgrounds for children",
          "The copenhagen zoo is an average zoo. The place has several nordic animals which are only attraction in this place. I was happy to see polar bear, panda, penguin for the first time. \nThe zoo is small. The enclosed places are smelly. The \u2026",

          "Copenhagen Zoo is really a wonderful place to spend your day. You can see that the animals are well taken care of and their habitats are large and not overcrowded. We a very good time and my 20 mont year old daughter loved every minute. \u2026",
          "One of the few zoos I've visited and left satisfied! You can clearly see that the animals are being well taken care of.",

          "It is an excellent outing for the whole family. Kids loved it and the best part is the Arctic ring with polar bears, seals etc. Recently a great addition of pandas. Basically i can't think of any popular animal that you can't find here. The \u2026",
          "An amazing zoo where you can see a lot of different kind of animals from all around the world. There are also some very aggressive birds that sometimes try to steel your food! Nevermind, it's a very interesting place and its symbol are nice Pandas. There is also a small souvenirs shop that offer a huge variety of things for all ages.",
          "Lot to see in small place.  lot of places to rest, eat, drink. good washrooms.  good play area for kids.",
          "The zoo quite well facilitated and is one of the main attractions of the city. One would find almost all the animals. Special attraction includes polar bear, Kangaroo, giraffe and tiger.  It was most spectacular to see polar bear swimming \u2026",
          "I love going to the Zoo in CPH, they have done so many new things over the last couple of years, and it is absolutely amazing to see how many of the animals that have kids, so they must do something. As I believe they are known to bee great breeders too. It also seems like they take great care the animals.",
          "Nice and tidy. Lots of space and good playgrounds for the kids",
          "The zoo was aggressively promoting that it has big panda, however, after waiting long queue we saw only an empty pen. The workers said it's sleeping somewhere. So, if you go there mostly to see the panda - consider this possibility. \u2026",
          "Spring season is interesting - there's a few cubs, pups and calves around; 2 giant lazy pandas you can watch while having a (I suspect gourmet) bite to eat. Nice place :)",

          "Great zoo to visit with kids",
          "The zoo is spacious and well attended. There are a lot of a animals divided into zones of habitats. There are many places for drinks and street food, ice cream, cotton candy etc. The entrance fee is 200kr which is not cheap, but in my opinion it is worth the price.",
          "One of the best zoo i ever visit and i would love to visit again and again. Decent environment. Huge number of different kind of species. Friendly workers. Must recommend!",
          "Great place, bigger than I actually anticipated, it will take more than 2 and half hours to went through it. Disappointed with Tropical house, there isn't enough diversity there.",
          "I am amazed by this zoo which locates in the very central of Copenhagen. Since this is the central location, the size of the zoo is not very big.But it is good enough for half day visit with kids. Only one thing I would like mention is the \u2026",

          "Great Zoo! As most zoo's in northern Europe, just better and cleaner.. and has a great street food area.. quite expensive but very good imo!",
          "As far as a zoo can be ethically acceptable, this is a rather fine structure. Most of the animals seem to have enough space and a 'reasonable' treatment. Surely conceived for children and families",
          "That was amazing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc!!! My family really enjoyed the zoo and had a good experience.   But I also can not stop thinking that these animals should be in the wild free instead\ud83d\ude41.",

          "Good day out, whether with kids or otherwise. A number of animals from all over the world. Brilliant",

          "Worth a visit with a copenhagen card, otherwise it is overpriced! The polar bear is worth it, though! :) Nicely decorated and good care of the animals.",
          "Loving the zoo. No stress. Just chill.",
          "Nice zoo. It has most of the polar animals which my daughter never saw before. All the cages had information in English which made us more comfortable.",

          "Big zoo to visit, a bit further from city centre but best you take hop off bus to get there!",
          "Sad lives those animals live.\n\nI highly recommend Scandinavisk Dyrepark, where the animals have much more space",
          "Easily one of the best zoos I have ever been too! \nAn absolute MUST for anyone visiting the city! You won\u2019t be disappointed!",
          "Nice place to spend the day. Lots to see. Amazing food. What an amazing experience. Even more so now with the pandas.",

          "Perfect place to visit!",
          "Went late on a Thursday afternoon in January. Very cold but very few other people there allowing us to spend some time waiting for the animals to appear. Bit of a building site currently but high quality enclosures for many of the animals.",

          "Nice place for family fun.",
          "We had a lovely time at the zoo in beautiful warm spring weather. The new panda enclosure was lovely, and as always the playground was a hit with kids. Only slight disappointment was the visit to the restaurant, which we felt was a bit overpriced",
          "The zoo is so beautiful and big! I expected the zoo to smell, but actually its so clean! Its also wheelchair accessible. You have to come early to spend the whole day because the zoo needs a lot of time. Also, try to visit it in a sunny day \u2026",
          "The panda's where incredible but some of the other enclosures need work",
          "Great zoo - amazing animals. I highly recommend.  Not great for parking though.",

          "I love all the new renovations and updates of the Zoo",
          "Very nice  & safe for kids\nBetter than other European zoo that I visited",
          "This is the best zoo I\u2019ve ever been to! You feel so close to the animals! I was even close enough to (sneakily) touch some! Don\u2019t try to touch the sea lions though, they don\u2019t like it \ud83d\ude02",
          "Saw a panda, polar bear, flamingos, Tasmanian devils, kangaroos, pet a llama, and saw many more fun animals of course! Fantastic summer stop for all ages!",

          "Place you must see. Strongly recomend to visit.",
          "The Zoo in itself is very good, but their choice of parking income is bad.. we bought tickets for all the cars and it turned out they were No longer valid... 8*790 dkr... In extra fees... simply Not ok.",
          "Probably the most well put together Zoo we have visited. The animals appear to be thriving and the interaction with them is quite unique. The division between animal and visitor is often only a short low hanging rope! Great options for \u2026",

          "Copenhagen zoo was amazing it had all the animals you\u2019d expect to see at a zoo and more. It was a very relaxed vibe which I think is down to Denmark\u2019s nature. The only key point would be that if your going on a weekend get their early as \u2026",

          "Nice zoo and easy to get to using local transportation",
          "The park outside of the zoo is splendid and full of green. About the zoo- well, I have seen better zoos in Europe. In some cages there are not any animels or you can not see any. I guess it's a good place if you come with small kids, otherwise it is just a waiste of time...",

          "Wild place all the time.\nAlways something new to see",
          "An awesome range of animals and it is getting better and better with rennovations. They are planning a new Panda space to be built soon and it does sound exciting.

          "A lot of empty cages and construction sites.\nThe overall experience was positive.\n\nPS: A peace of advice, don't bother going up the tower, it's a long way up, lots of stairs, and very limited payoff! The view is good but it's blocked by the net surrounding the tower.",

          "Possibly my 2nd favourite zoo in Europe after that one in Vienna... This place is amazing, dannes have thought about everything, literally! Full of places for lunch, picnic, ice cream, crepes, you name it. Great service, a lot facilities, superb variety of any animals! Totally worth visiting",
          "I've been to a few zoos and I think this one is my favourite. The animals can mingle with other species like they might in the wild... not that the lions and tigers mingle with the antelope or zebra... We got so close to the elephants and \u2026",
          "One of the best zoo experiences that I've had. There were probably less than 50 people in the zoo when I was there. It was great. There was a good variety too.\nSome of the animals seemed a little sad.",
          "Very nice place to eat, if you come to visit zoo you should definitely try the fish and chips",
          "HORRIBLE ! It's a nightmare for\nanimals : they are caged in little spaces. They are considered as objects to divert tourists, it's a deeply cruelty. You just have to imagine it would be humans......",

          "Very nice and clean place to go, highly recommend when visiting Copenhagen",
          "Pretty good zoo as far as zoos go. It isn\u2019t particularly large but you can make a day out of it. The goat petting area and the walkthrough reptile house are the highlights. Food and drink is even more expensive than average, even for copenhagen. I did not understand the hype over the new pandas, they were not particularly amazing.",
          "I adored this zoo. Having been to many zoo's in my life i have never experienced polar bears feeding in the water, it was a beautiful experience and one i would like to see again. Nicely laid out and plenty to see. I also enjoyed watching 2 \u2026",
          "This zoo is amazing. Lots of unique animals I've not seen in other zoos. Most of the animals were very active so they were easy to spot. Check it out if you're in Copenhagen. It's walking distance from the city (2-3 miles).",

          "Good for a family visit. Not many animals on display. Tried it as part of Copenhagen card",
          "Copenhagen Zoo has a large variety of animals from tiny bush babies to giant elephants. The zoo itself is fairly large and takes a good few hours to see everything if you're taking your time to have a good look in to each of the enclosures. \u2026",
          "Ok, but hard to orientate yourself and a feeling that there are more restaurants/kiosks, etc selling things than animals. Also some parking arrangement (free or discount) could be made for people who have to come by car.",

          "Great place to bring your kids or your date.",

          "Great zoo. The panda is a big plus.",
          "The whole place felt a little less tidy than other zoos I've been to.. The animal enclosures had garbage in them from idiot guests who don't know how trash cans work, and there was barely any staff anywhere to be found.",
          "This place is a fine example of how a zoo should be managed..the wild animals and birds look healthy and well taken care of...a very high benchmark",
          "It's a wonderful and cosy zoo. The restaurant by the pandas is highly suggested for an early dinner.",
          "Perfect day with my favourite girl \u2764\ufe0f",

          "The zoo is nice and so, but at some points it seemed to have a bit of animal cruel, as the Polar Bear running back and forth desperate to get some fresh, and the grounds of tourists just looking at the animal seemingly desperate. (It was \u2026",
          "It is good to visit again and again.",
          "Great zoo!",

          "Im a huge fan of Zoo. The animals are obviously wonderful but the physical setting in zoo is what really counts for me. It seems the animals have what they need plus more. That they thrive and are taken care of. The walkways and places for \u2026",

          "Too much rebuilding going on and alot of empty cages both indoor and outdoor. Hard to find the way around the construction site. However the staff was very helpful. Will come back when it is warmer..",
          "Realy nice park. Many fine strolls where you can be near the animals. The animals seem to have good space. \nAt the time for my visit the construction of the new panda area took a lot of space. \nAlso the food options for vegans was poor (to say it nice)",
          "Wonderful zoo. The African savanna enclosure is a highlight, as is the petting zoo.",

          "Very nice place, animals seem to be happy.",
          "I think some animals suffer due to a limited space and they deserve larger living areas. You can find several animals like bear, rhinoceros,  leopard, lions, crocodile,monkeys and even tasmanian devil. Also there are playgrounds for your \u2026",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is a really great zoo.  They have all kinds of awesome animals and they also had a sand sculpture competition going on while we were there which was really cool, they looked incredible.  Overall I would definitely go there again.  Also if you have a copenhagen card (which I highly recommend) you can get in for free.",
          "Maybe it was the time i got there, but it realy stunk and the animal where caged so the employes could feed them. But im sure it would be a good experiance for the kids.",

          "Easily the best zoo I've ever been to! Not many zoos have polar bears to offer. There was a night zoo which was something I had never seen before as well as an interactive tropical zoo where you are inside with the animals. They are \u2026",
          "We like this zoo much!",
          "Animals in cages what else",
          "Big and really nice zoo close to the centre of Copenhagen. If you are on a vacation to Copenhagen, or just love animals, you should definitely consider to drop by for the afternoon.\nIn addition to what you would expect to find at a zoo, \u2026",
          "It was a very good zoo but a large section of the zoo you had to wait in a long line to get in, and in that section was the main attractions, like the pandas and elephant.",
          "Surprisingly large zoo. And alot of different type of animals. Not great parking space for cars. Food inside is quite expensive.",

          "Great place for kids and grown ups!",
          "We spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon enjoying the Zoo. It occupies a fairly large site with the animals spread out into continents. In September 2018 work is ongoing building a new large panda enclosure due to have 3 pandas, hopefully \u2026",
          "Plain and simple, just awsome zoo..",

          "Nice place, cozy atmosphere, good opportunities for seeing the animals, which look well cared for. Dining facilities could do with a boost, but overall a great experience.",
          "Excellent zoo, looks like the animals are well taken care off and they have enough space to roam around. \nKids (and adults) will have a great time since everyone should see their favorite animal. \nWe bought the Copenhagen city card so it was included.",
          "Great place to go to See amimals",
          "Nice place to see more than 3000+ species...most importantly a Panda in Denmark=-O\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd9d\ud83e\udd9d",
          "The front reception and entrance staff were a little shortage. The zoo is compact and not much time needed to spend here.",

          "Second visit here, just gets better each time",

          "A really nice zoo",
          "If you happen to have a day off in Copenhagen, I would definitely recommend visiting the zoo.

There aren't too many different species, giving the visitor an opportunity to get a more complete of the existing ones.",
          "Lot's to see, hear and experience. Great staff, and good politics over all.",

          "Very nice zoo! Be prepared for lots of walking though and my feet were aching at the end of the day. Many cool animals (really loved the polar bears) and it is family friendly. Place is easy enough to navigate. It is not located centrally but not too far out that it is inconvenient. Go if you've the time!",
          "Absolutely adore this zoo. They focus on the well-being of all the animals, so each has a large enough enclosure with an additional space to escape the crowds, if they don't wish to be seen. 10/10 will visit again.",
          "It nice my family loves it",
          "Absolutely disgusting and dirty. Didn\u2019t see a single employee taking care of animals. The animals looks miserable and all of the water has trash in it. It smells bad. Please do not support this place.",

          "Is a really different zoo because you can interact with some animals in their natural habitat. Never saw that in any zoo. I'll give 5 stars when they finish  the constructions. \ud83d\ude42",

          "Big enough to spend your whole day there. The price is a little bit expensive.",
          "Fantastic zoo with a great selection of animals - including a polar bear. Most of these were very well displayed, allowing good views and close access to even the biggest animals. Plenty of other facilities including caf\u00e9s, toilets and picnic areas.",
          "A very nice way to spend the day, outdoor so I recommend visiting when it the weather is fine. A lot of different animals and sections, with mostly interesting displays (some displays naturally make it difficult to see all animals at all \u2026",

          "Pandas, what to say more",
          "We had an absolutely wonderful day at the Copenhagen Zoo with our one and a half year son. He was stunned and amazed at the exhibitions. The zoo is very large and requires the whole day for you to see all the different areas. A must if you are visiting Copenhagen, specially for families with small children.",
          "Visited here on my first day in Copenhagen, it\u2019s free entry with the Copenhagen Card. \nThe way the exhibits are laid out is a bit odd but it\u2019s easy enough to find your way around so you don\u2019t miss any of the animals. \nSome of the animals \u2026",
          "Nice place for Kids and adults\ud83d\ude09",

          "Unfortunately a lot of construction work for panda house at the centre of the zoo at the time (autumn 2018). Should be fine after it has finished if quality is going to be as beautiful as elephant house.",
          "Great fun! Lots of cool animals",
          "Very good zoo. It was a shame that it was under construction when we went so no pandas! A MASSIVE problem in the zoo is that there are no signs in English! Even the menus in the restaurants, we could only find one restaurant with a menu in \u2026",
          "Nice place. Fine Panda Bears \ud83d\udc3c",

          "Lovely zoo",
          "Wonderfully laid out, large, engaging, inspiring, with a great range of wildlife. The habitats are designed to benefit the gorgeous animals but also help people have breathtaking close-ups. Can't wait to return to see the finished panda exhibit when it's done! :)",

          "Great place to spend a family day!",
          "Excellent zoo with a large variety of animals. Also didn't tend to be too packed if you go on the right day. It's not particularly close to any train station so it's best to get there by car or bus if you don't want a long walk.",
          "I had a positive experience overall. There were numerous animals that you could visit and see (even though quite a few were hidden inside their cages due to hot sunny weather). We entered with Copenhagen cards which made it very simple at the counter. The zoo was well structured (A massive panda section coming up soon).",
          "Copenhagen ZOO is among the finest i the World!",

          "Easy to find and a fab array of animals. They're currently building a panda enclosure which would be great to see once it's complete! It's also right next to Fredricksberg Palace and gardens which is also worth a look whilst you're there",
          "Good place for animal lover\nGo there around 11.30 onward",
          "One of our favorite zoos. A bit messy and chaotic this year though due to all the construction going on for the coming pandas.

          "One of the best zoo in world. Though a huge part is under construction and that might spoil your experience if you go in recent future but I am sure polar bear and girrafe would make up for it. You get to see animals from as close as \u2026",
          "Spend a whole day here. Kids love it. Big zoo. Good food, generous portions at the grill",
          "I\u2019m usually against zoo\u2019s but the copenhagen zoo is probably one of the best there is. \n\nThe animals gets well taken care of and they reinvest a lot of money into their animals welfare, breeding programmes and park infrastructure. \n\nTheir petting zoo is fun for kids (and playful adults) and they got a vast amount of species.",

          "One of the best zoological gardens I have ever been. The thing I like the most is an idea of mixing animals in one paddock. The only thing I was disappointed in is the condition of the toilets - it doesn't look like Denmark I'm used too.",
          "at the time, in works of improvement. It will certainly be much better in the future.\nin any case, some of the sections, very interesting.",

          "Phenomenal zoo. The fact you can get so up close to some of the deadliest and most unusual animals on the planet is a great tick in the box for this place. The only zoo I've been to I could say it lacks behind is Berlin. But still a 10/10 place. Good price too",
          "Got a really weird vibe from the zoo, the ponds often look dirty, most animals seemed distressed. It's the worst zoo I've been to so far.",
          "Love the integrated areas where several species live together. Well done Zoo. Mikkel who presented at the flamingos was very eloquent and knowledgeable.",
          "Amazing!",
          "A nice park where you get very close to the animals. The counter \"reception\" , very rude service and can kill the customer experience before it even started, but once you are in it is better. \nThe surroundings inside are nice though \u2026",
          "Perfect place to spend the day with a family.",

          "Great place to go with friends and family. Gave only 4 stars because, though renovations were ongoing (especially to add a Chinese section highlighted with the gaint Panda), a few the cages (eg for the leopard) were empty. I nevertheless had a marvelous time.",
          "So much to see in one day, especially with a toddler in tow. Many exhibits were immersive beyond any other zoo experience I've had. Plus, the view of Copenhagen from the zoo tower is spectacular.",
          "The best zoo in Copenhagen",
          "I loved the Wombat! It was the highlight of my day. Also there are a lot off other animals,  bus stops right infront off the zoo, panda shelter is under construction untill april 2019",
          "Going in winter to the zoo isn't very exciting as it was quite cold and many animals are inside. The zoo has been renovating for a new panda attraction so that will be exciting. We watched the primates being fed. The have animals from Asia, \u2026",
          "We went here wen it was renowaiting so one part of the zoo was off limits but everything else was really intresting we spend the whole day there",
          "My heart broke at the tiny hippo enclosure. There are 3 fully sized hippos (5 total) and they are all stepping on each other. Hippos walk for long distances at night and the enclosure didn't have any room for them to do so. Heartbroken.",
          "Polar bears are awesome, but you can also find there a lot of different animals. Zoo is quite big and nice. It has places to eat and also places to rest and smoke"

        "wiki": "The National Museum of Denmark (Nationalmuseet) in Copenhagen is Denmark\u2019s largest museum of cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures, alike. The museum's main building is located a short distance from Str\u00f8get at the center of Copenhagen. It contains exhibits from around the world, from Greenland to South America. Additionally, the museum sponsors SILA - The Greenland Research Center at the National Museum of Denmark to further archaeological and anthropological research in Greenland.The museum has a number of national commitments, particularly within the following key areas: archaeology, ethnology, numismatics, ethnography, natural science, conservation, communication, building antiquarian activities in connection with the churches of Denmark, as well as the handling of the Danef\u00e6 (the National Treasures).\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe museum covers 14,000 years of Danish history, from the reindeer-hunters of the Ice Age, Vikings, and works of religious art from the Middle Ages, when the church was highly significant in Danish life. Danish coins from Viking times to the present and coins from ancient Rome and Greece, as well as examples of the coinage and currencies of other cultures, are exhibited also.

          "I have seen many museums but this is one of the few that was especially engaging - I really enjoyed myself and would love to return one day! It was like going into a time machine and stepping into various homes from different times. Fantastic job! (I went in August 2019, my",
          "Great place to learn more about history, not only history of Denmark, but also some human and world history. However, i thought there were too many information which are too \"new\", as I usually prefer \"older\" stuff in a museum. It's worth the visit though.",
          "I simply love this place, and come there several times a year. Viking exhibition is just top notch, and the boredom button initiative is just fun, and not just for kids. Can't say anything bad about this place, keep up the good job everyone. (Rane, you made a change for the",
          "The National Museum in Copenhagen is a natural (and cultural) history attraction. It has always been good but has improved more and more over the years. There is all sorts of cool stuff to look at. If you find this sort of museum interesting then I'd say go for it.",
          "Pay, not great info... It's a national museum right. Well there are also more exiting things at time. But when I am asked to pay at a national museum that's known as free entry (we pay through our taxes) then I expect an extra. I'm sure it's there too... But if I don't know what",
          "Free viking tour was excellent. Learned alot about myths and truths. Interesting collection of artifacts.",
          "This museum is huge, we spent 4 hours and only left because we were tired!! It has something for everyone and is good value for money (for Denmark). If you are lucky enough to pick up a coupon book at an airport/around Copenhagen city centre you can get discount off the ticket",
          "Well organized museum with rich Danish historic contents. The inside corridors and the outer squares are pleasant for walking and enjoying the scenery.",
          "An impressive museum with a large variety of exhibitions. It was a great to learn about Danish history and culture. We spent a couple of hours exploring the museum and needed longer to see everything. We used our 72 hour Copenhagen Cards to gain entry. Would recommend to",
          "Went to see the biking exhibit. Lots of artefacts, some hands on bits. Interesting German section upstairs. Pretty nice museum.",
          "A very good museum which takes you through the history of Denmark from the Stone Age through via the Vikings and the Empire to modern day. Some other interesting exhibitions in there also. Well organised. Friendly staff. Reccomend.",
          "The Danish national museum i a must see when visiting Copenhagen. You can get ours to go to see the Danish history and old relics. 100 kr entry is worth it and should be on the Copenhagen bucket list.",
          "Lots and lots of different and interesting tings from the past. Good explanations everywhere on both danish and english. Kind and helpfull personel",
          "Good place to visit and you could spend a very productive wet day here. There are a wide range of exhibits and it takes ages to get round the place.",
          "I have read a lot about the history of the Nordics during the stone- and bronze age and knew that there were a lot of objects in the museum with a lot of history in them. There were more than I expected and the collection was presented well in detail. I would certainly recommend",
          "Worth the visit. You have to see it,it's very good organized. Nice place,convenient and if you are fond about Viking you gonna love it.",
          "It is a very nice building, and beautiful exhibition on the nations of the world. But I have more expected about Vikings.",
          "Unfortunately we were a bit short on time and would love to have spent more time here. Comprehensive displays, artefacts,history and art. Loved the central stair case. It was a delight to visit this building. We particularly liked the statues of Ancient Greek and Roman warriors.",
          "Lots to see and a well laid out game plan in the museum with which to do it. We saw lots of children interacting with their parents and grand parents with the exhibits so children and this museum are not mutually exclusive. You could spend far more time here than we did, as is",
          "The two hours we mooched around the museum were much needed not just to get out of the rain but to see some amazing Viking finds and eat the best apple cake in Denmark! Well with a visit",
          "It is always worth visiting the National Museum. The Viking section seems to be a permanent one, and highly recommended. But currently there is a special exhibition called symply Germany. The advertising flags dotted around town are very immaginative - shape of ritter sport",
          "We visited the museum on the suggestion of friends. As it was quite cold in Copenhagen, it was a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. Very interesting history of Denmark and most of the items on display have descriptions in Danish and English. We truly enjoyed our time here",
          "There is so much to see here -From fashion to the design of chairs to why items are constructed the way they are. It's an extremely laid back museum which you can browse at your leisure. We went hungover and it's a great activity to do when you don't have to read a bunch of tiny",
          "Had a good wander around the museum then joined a 2 hour english' free tour of the museum - well worth it - brought it to life so much more than just wandering - absolutely worth it. Would also recommend the tour of the Danish 'Victorian-age' apartment that the Museum runs -",
          "At the national museum of Denmark I expected more of Denmark\u2019s history. The building is beautiful but there\u2019s so much so see. I started on the top floor and worked my way down as the ground floor was extremely crouded",
          "Very nice museum. A look back at the history of the Danish city was very interesting. Also there where very nice statues of ancient Greek and Roman period as well as French",
          "A visit to this place is like visiting Denmark in a capsule. Extensive items superbly presented. Unfortunately the time is never enough. There is also a nice cafe to relax after all the walkking in the museum",
          "It's a must visit if you want to know the history of Denmark and nordic countries. Brilliant place and so many things inside to discover. 4- hrs minimum to complete everything inside. Free entry with Copenhagen card.",
          "If you have some spare times, this might be a good option since it\u2019s right next to Christiansborg Palace. Tips: included in Copenhagen Card 72 hours ( cost ~ 739 DKK = 160 AUD)",
          "A nice place to visit to discover more of this country: everyone is welcome, especially children. There is plenty of objects that tell us about Danish history and population",
          "Certainly would recommend. We focused on the ancient history (vikings) and 1660-2000 sections. This fulfilled our interest for Viking history and also sufficed for explaining how Denmark has come to be what it is now. Denmark has had a great volume of archeological finds on",
          "Very nice welcomed by the ushers at the entrance , you can storage your coats or bags in a secure safety box. The museum is basically like a time machine, from mummies, Vikings , movies explaining some important events, and off course the Sun Chariot. There is nice coffee shop ,",
          "This comprehensive museum of everything Danish has something for everyone, well presented and organized. There's everyday Danish life, Viking life and armed conflicts, including WW2, all thoroughly depicted here. Nice overview of the country's history in one place.",
          "Plenty of art of all types to see here in a beautiful building. Gift shop was severely lacking but they did have a nice place to eat onsite. Easy to find and in a nice area.",
          "A lot had happened in the museum since I last visited (20 years ago), and there is nothing not worth to seeing again, so it will not be that long before our next visit. The displays are stunning and especially the Viking part was really cool. There is so much to see that we only",
          "The range and quality of the artefacts and displays at this museum is mind-blowing!! Take at least a day if you can. There is a cafe and restaurant on site. The atmosphere is lovely.",
          "Especially when it was raining. We spent hours here looking at the different exhibitions. So impressed that you can leave your coat, brolly etc in the foyer and no one touches anything. The only thing that let the place down was the caf\u00e9. Spent almost 30 minutes waiting in",
          "The website suggested English-speaking visitors spend their time on the first floor, so that is what we did. The exhibits were chronological and as we moved through time, we learned how the culture expanded and developed. Highlights included the Egtved girl, the Sun Chariot, and",
          "Nationalmuseet was previously called T\u00f8jhus museum. This museum has changed a lot during later years. They enormous collections from the dark ages until present of uniforms, small and huge guns and all types of equipment from different wars. The people working there are very",
          "Enjoyable day out learning aboutrhehiatory of Denmark. Wonderful people, wonderful culture. Really enjoyed it.",
          "What is better to do on a rainy in Copenhagen (and they have some...) than to go visit a museum (and they have some...). Although I had been in Copenhagen several times already, I had never been to this museum, for reasons unknown. This was the time ! For 95 DKK entrance fee,",
          "I learned about Danish pre-history, Vikings, and runes of course. But I was also pleasantly impressed by other surprising exhibits like one on Mongolia, nomads, and Genghis Khan. A good option for spending 2-4 hours especially on a rainy day!",
          "For me, the most interesting museum in Copenhagen. There are lots of exhibits You can find here everything about the history of the Danes, starting with prehistory, passing to the Vikings, the Middle Ages and modern times. Danish explorers, lifestyle over time, weapons, jewelry,",
          "I am particularly interested in the prehistoric period and had read that this museum had an extensive display. Wow! Over 20 rooms devoted to this period. Very well displayed and explanations alongside. I could not believe the amount and quality of the exhibits. Really you need a",
          "Huge museum with lots to see but the layout didn't flow and you couldn't tell what you had seen or missed. Everything was a bit of a maze.",
          "We went as a quick visit (landed on the same day so abit tired but I was unable to go in Feb), the layout was abit confusing however it was very modern and tidy (actually going in rooms, not as much as a flow type museum which I guess is positive as you know more what you are",
          "A visit to this museum is a must for anyone with an interest in history. The collections are very well displayed and cover not just Danish history but also artifacts from around the world. The section on Vikings is very good and I would recommend seeing this only if you are",
          "A big museum in which you can spend hours if the exhibition suits you. So much to see over many levels.",
          "We visited on a rainy day and it was a welcome respite! We arrived just as a Meet the Viking tour started in English. This did cost a bit more but it was worth it! Our tour guide is studying at the university and grew up taking part in Viking re-enactments. We walked through",
          "Classic history museum with Danish accent. All ages, from the Stone Age to the present, are presented in detail. Especially, of course, the Viking Age is presented in detail. What is special, there are many modern interactive features. The museum itself is quite large, plan 3-4",
          "Really enjoyed this museum though I only got to see half of it as only had 2 hours. It\u2019s well laid out with plenty to see. Viking exhibit on first floor was particularly impressive. Would return",
          "Great Viking exhibit. Saw the Viking exhibit and toys on the top floor. Wonderful dollhouses. 1-2 hours.",
          "I must have visited a couple of hundred museums in the past 60 years but this one has to be in the top 15. The museum ( free on Tuesday ) traces the history of Denmark is portrayed from the beginning to present day. Not to be left out is the rest of the world and Denmark's",
          "The layout of the National Museum Denmark is not optimal, but there are some cool things to see inside.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. Two galleries and exhibitions stood out for us. Firstly, we were fortunate to join a free guided tour of the prehistoric collection which was very educational and informative. After a short break, our second experience was the special",
          "Timing meant we only spent an hour or so here but honestly you could spend days. Starts tracing how Denmark came to be, hoing right back to 'caveman' days. Sure to go again next time back in Copenhagen",
          "Able to coat and bag check which is convenient. Museum starts you of with the Early ages of Man and covers the age of the Vikings as well. Quite small museum and takes less than 3h to complete.",
          "Fine museum of the history of the country, starting with the bronze age. I learned a surprising amount about Bronze Age technology. If you're going to be in Denmark for a few days, we liked seeing Roskilde then Helsingor before this museum. There are cross links, and we think",
          "Coming from Australia I was amazed at the length of time this museum covers from stone age to modern history and everything in between, I spent around 3+ hours here checking out all the exhibits and loved it all. I would recommend to anybody",
          "It was a very unhurried day at the museum. Staff wants you to linger and study the artifacts and learn who they are and where they came from. We saw it near the end of our trip. I suggest a visit early on so that as you see other sites, the context will be more meaningful.",
          "Great time visiting the museum! We went during the viking exhibition and found it very interesting! The museum has absolutely so much to offer, you could easily spend the whole day in there. Only issue is the lack of affordable food services on site. But you can jump out for",
          "Most tourists who are not of Danish background probably are not knowledgeable about Danish history. But if you have a couple hours, you can learn a tremendous amount by exploring the national museum's collection spanning thousands of years....up through the Vikings, the Danish",
          "We have been to the museum twice and still have not seen everything. The Smithsonian in Wash. DC is the only museum that I know of that surpasses this museum. It would be an evil sin to be in Copenhagen and not see this museum. It is almost worth going to Copenhagen just to",
          "I visit museums everywhere with a particular interest in history. This museum is extremely well done. Exhibits are put together in an easy to understand and follow way. This museum has everything from mummies found intact in the bogs of Denmark, Viking ships, and full room",
          "Excellent museum. Needs plenty of time. We had three hours and was not enough, had to pick and choose. Vikings bit was superb",
          "We love to visit museums and this one didn't disappoint. Vast collection of exhibits from diverse cutlural examples from around the world. You need a minium of two hours to appreciate the displayed items. Well worth a visit.",
          "This place is huge and has a lot of information to take in. Wouldn't take a child as they would get bored very quickly. Need to spend at least 2 hours minimum here!",
          "We visited during one of our walks back to our hotel. It is a nice museum with good displays but not extremely exciting. Shows numerous local arts & crafts.",
          "This museum was excellent - in particular the Viking exhibition. The only thing was that it\u2019s a vast museum and I feel that more than one visit is necessary! We certainly didn\u2019t see everything in there.",
          "Very mediocre experience as the museum fails to tell a story. The vikings exhibits were interesting (seen better in other Scandinavian countries) but at the same time they look a bit awkward (especially the cosplay section). The layout of the museum is confusing and it doesn't",
          "A great museum, with a very interesting collection. Being Danish, there's a focus on Vikings, which is really interesting. If you can catch the guided tours, it's well worth the time - they really bring the artefacts to life with some great stories (like the fact that many of",
          "I could have happily spent two days here. This is a wonderful museum with amazing guided tours - I went on several although time was running short. The guides were engaging and the information provided was fascinating (even in areas of pre-history that are not my forte). Loads",
          "We're both 26. This place is so modern with its minimalist design, very Danish! The contents of the museum itself are cool, an emphasis on vikings is what I especially enjoyed but other than that it didn't stand out to me from other national museums I've been to. Definitely",
          "We had only an hour but loved the early history exhibits, Bronze age information etc. One of my favorite things were a case of bronze age musical instruments. The cafe does lovely smorrebrod.",
          "This museum had tons of history! Their main exhibit began with the first settlements and progressed through each era. Some cool artifacts from each era were on display. A classic boring museum :)",
          "Very informative exhibition on the history of the Danes and Vikings. Also a great exhibit on Gengis Kahn.",
          "I was told there is no audio guide and the only information is whatever is on display, which is not much to be honest. This is quite disappointing. I spent just over 2 hours in the museum, 3.5 hours if you include the time i spent eating lunch in their restaurant, and i was",
          "Really cool museum showing the history of Denmark and also some extra goodies, spent about 2/3 hours here. Would suggest as a must visit place in Copenhagen",
          "Normally museums are not a first choice, but we were in Copenhagen for quite a number of days and so made our way here. It was a pleasant surprise\u2014well done. This is worth the effort.",
          "Excellent museum. I am amazed by the abundance of the collections, especially the ancient Egypt and Greece items.",
          "We took a guided tour through this museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are lots of cool artifacts to exemplify all sorts of Danish life.",
          "You need at least 4 hours to run through the museum. They also had genghis khan special exhibit and it ends by sept 7. Learnt a lot about the Mongolian dynasty. Also the denmark history has been well covered in chronological order. Restrooms every floor. A must see. Guided",
          "It's really worth the extra few dollars. Great museum to learn about Danish history from the Bronze age to current times. Very informative about the Viking period. The tour we took was called Meet the Vikings and Mattias? was a terrific guide. Excellent exhibit was on when",
          "A good museum for learning about the history of Denmark for the uninformed (like myself!). The museum is at it's best for the history of Denmark up until 1200 AD or so, covering early man, Bronze age etc, and the Vikings. The more modern Denmark stuff (post-viking to today) is",
          "As indicated, this is a really outstanding museum, having a great diversity of Danish history through all ages, not even being scared of its darkest parts. Also, the exhibition on Gengis khan was rich in detail and depicted very well. A must-see around kopenhagen.",
          "An excellent museum with a huge deal of interresting things to see! Especially the exhibition about the Vikings and about Djenghis Kahn. Be sure to have several hours to sp end here! PS: The lunch restaurant is excellent too.",
          "Good exhibition of the Vikings history. Large playroom for kids (good for 3-7 yeas old). But real scientist might be disappointed ;-)",
          "They have really good food upstairs, but this is not the reason to visit. I was there when they had a fabulous exhibit of Genghis Khan. There are plenty of other exhibits to make this a worthy stop. We were very impressed with the entire museum. Give yourself several hours",
          "A wonderful flow to this exhibit that totally engulfed us. Then a great Danish lunch in the cafe and onto a few more permanent exhibits. Well worth the time",
          "The National Museum has so many things to see and do. Firstly you can choose between tours: Meet the Danes, we did that and it was fantastic. Our guide explained so much about the danish culture and the society nowadays. Highly recommended. Meet the Vikings: tour about the",
          "We found a lot of great information about Danish life in this museum and wished he had more time to enjoy it. We were very interested in the Viking sections of this museum and it was fascinating. It had a really nice gift shop, too.",
          "We arrived at the museum shortly after it opened at 10.00am. Fortunately because it was relatively early, it was not yet crowded. Our Copenhagen Cards were used to gain admission. As our time for the museum visit was somewhat limited, we carefully chose from the guide pamphlet",
          "Wonderful collection from around the world. I learned new things about Vikings and Ghengis Khan. Saw great examples of art from areas of Asia, from Egypt, Greece, Africa, Native Americans, etc., as well across christianity. It is a huge museum that takes pride in the display of",
          "This is included in the Copenhagen card. Some of the exhibits are things you can see in your local museum--artifacts from ancient Egypt and other places around the world. There was an interesting display on Vikings and the early history of Denmark that was worth spending some",
          "While studying abroad, I went to the museum with friends and then again when my parents came to visit. The special exhibits are always changing and adds variety to the museum. The first time, it was all about Vikings and then when I returned it included Japanese culture. It's a",
          "Lots to see and do. Took the Meet the Vikings tour which was very good our guide was very knowledgeable.",
          "Learnt more about Mongolia in here than Denmark. Expected to learn all about Denmark but came away with very little information. Even the history of the vikings turned in to a breakdown on the different stones ages in the world. Very much a world history lesson. Was really",
          "I expected to finally know more about the history of Denmark but I couldn't be more disappointed. The exhibitions are poorly organized, with no clear chronological order or in depth explanations. Instead it seems like the focus was on displaying as many objects as possible, and",
          "We visited the national museum and was impressed with how much it had to offer. Lots of information and exhibits of danish history as well as the vikings and much more. Can be good for all ages. Lots of different exhibits to explore only downside is your walking around for along",
          "The museum has several different collections under one roof, and some are changing yearly. We have been trough the national history collection before, and concentrated on the Vikings, the exhebision it very nice and the speculative portraits of vikings by Jim Lyngvild sre very",
          "A great museum with lots of Danish history and real good special exhibits. Make sure to book a daily tour - they last an hour and most are free. They even have a lunch tour every Tuesday with a local. Lots to see and the Genghis Kahn exhibit is amazing! Since we enjoyed it so",
          "Plethera of history, artifacts, statues. Staff friendly, knowledgeable, mulitlingual. Not recommended for children under 14 years old",
          "But the second floor, People of the World is massive, poorly laid out and eventually tiring. The local Nordic prehistoric section is fantastic though, worth visiting for that alone.",
          "Another great place for children of all ages which takes you on a tour of Danish history. You could spend hours here. We stuck to Danish prehistory: the Egtved Girl, the Sun Chariot and the impressive Rune Stones from the Viking Age.... The Museum offers an interesting range",
          "This museum has permanent exhibits that include Viking history, and ancient history of Scandinavia. The objects, the explanations, the tours are all fascinating. This year (2019) there is an exhibit about Mongolia that is beautifully curated.b you enter the exhibit through a",
          "The Viator Copenhagen 2- Day city card allowed us to visit Tivoli cardens, had a great Canal boat excursion in Copenhagen Canal from the Nyhaven area and visited the National Museum of Denmark on the second day. It was excellent way to see the city as we used the card to rid the",
          "Good exhibits all around, though a better map and guide brochure would have been helpful. Quite varied with artifacts, history, pre-history. A good introduction to Danish history and culture.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the museum. In fact, I wish we had arrived earlier so we could have had more time there. The exhibits were very varied ranging from prehistoric artefacts to 20th century toys and kept everyone interested. The doll's houses were really interesting",
          "One of the best attractions of Copenhagen and a very well laid out and explained museum with a variety of items. From vikings to egyptians, from toy houses to house and life recontrunctions, incredibly interesting. Do not skim through, we had 1hr 30min and we didnt even manage",
          "This Museum is about the Danish people and it tells their story well, from pre-history all the way up to the present. The museum is on three main floors, with an upper floor devoted to Egyptian and Near Eastern antiquities. I was surprised at the great number of artifacts on",
          "We only had a limited amount of time so we concentrated on the Viking exhibit and the nomad area. The nomad exhibit was fascinating with several TV presentations. The main lobby and admissions are very well organized. Could have spent all afternoon but had other committments.",
          "We recently visited this museum and found it to be extraordinary! Having visited many museums all over the world, the National Museum of Denmark is among very best we've ever visited. Not surprisingly the Danish prehistory in Viking exhibits were the highlight.",
          "I really liked the history of human creature started and goes to the Nordic Bronze Age. The story of Trundholm sun chariot creation was giving something special feeling",
          "An insteresting museum with lots of amazing artefacts about the Vikings. Defintately worth a visit. Very close to Christianborg Palace.",
          "A great place to learn the history of Denmark and see some amazing artifacts. Of special interest there is a section that spans prehistoric times and the Iron Age up to interactions with the Romans. Several bog mummies on exhibit. There is currently a special Viking exhibit with",
          "This museum has a number of wonderful collections. We were delighted with the Genghis Khan exhibit. The Egyptian collection is spectacular. So many excellent pieces.",
          "We went to experience some culture but found that many exhibits were so poorly ventilated that it was difficult to spend much time in them. Quite expensive too for what it was. The modern Danish culture and prehistory exhibits stood out.",
          "We spent a happy hour in the children\u2019s museum with our almost 3 year old. It\u2019s made up of little spaces children can explore and role play in including a classroom, market stall, and kitchen. All very hands on and children are able to touch everything which makes it relaxing",
          "The museum is located near Christiansborg, the old royal place and itself a former royal residence. There are permanent exhibitions showing Danish history from Stone Age and until modern times and temporary ones - right now about Djengis Khan and his empire. The only thing",
          "Enjoyed this museum very much. We took a guided tour of how early people survived from prehistory time to the Iron age. The young lady guide was excellent. The museum has a huge collection of artifacts and the Vikings exhibit was superb. I could have spent all day here. If you",
          "We had entry on our Copenhagen Card, which I would strongly recommend to anyone visiting. We booked a meet the Danes tour and were guided by \u201cMe\u201d, she was a 22 year old female History Student. She was engaging, funny and very knowledgable.... she was open to questions and",
          "This is a very large museum and has many exhibits,and many historical artifacts,some which go back thousands of years",
          "This museum was definitely worth the price of admission which was not very much considering how expensive Copenhagen is. It has an impressive Viking and Mongolian aka Genghis Khan collection. It also has the requisite early Danish collection just to get you familiarize w/ the",
          "We thought this might be worth a 3 hours visit. Then when we got there 2 areas were not open. However, we like our prehistoric artifacts and all the medieval history. We ended up spending the whole day. Really nice, very small restaurant outside around the back side of the",
          "There is so much to this museum, that I was not expecting. They have unearthed some historical pieces that are on display. It cam as a pleasant surprise that there is so much to enjoy. We didn't allow enough time.",
          "One of the best Viking exhibits in the entire Baltic region. If one is interested in Viking history this is a must-see.",
          "A lot of informaton about what you see in the different rooms and monters. Great service from the staff and decent prices. You should really set aside a whole day here, because there is a lot to see!",
          "This museum is gorgeous and really wonderful too and many things can b\u00e9 learnt from this plac\u00e9 , ancient things were really amazing.",
          "There\u2019s so much to see in this interesting museum. Fortunately I visited in the morning and had no reason to hurry. There are many different sections on 3 levels, surrounding a central atrium or courtyard. The layout can be a bit confusing and it\u2019s easy to miss sections because",
          "Having Viking blood I felt it necessary to visit the museum and learn more of my history. It does not disappoint! This was the best exhibition of Norse & Viking history I have ever seen. Loved the visit, loved the caf\u00e9, loved the gift shop.",
          "Fantastic museum, very very rich in temporary and permanent exhibitions. We enjoyed the prehistoric, meet the vikings and the genghis Khan one.",
          "Worth a visit, my husband is into his history and found the Museum very informative. Very well organised, cafe was lovely also.",
          "I only had time to look at the prehistory and middle ages exhibits. This museum requires 2 to 3 hours. Pick up a map (see picture). Make sure to look at the Gundestrup cauldron (Iron Age).",
          "Really enjoyed the Danish people exhibition, about their history. Very well presented. Great gift shop too",
          "The museum was once the Prince's residence and it is now a fantastic museum. We used our Copenhagen Card to get into the museum at no charge. Wow, the collections are fantastic. The \"Meet The Vikings\" section was great. The model heads were a little to life like, but very cool.",
          "Unless I am completely wrong, this museum seems to be one of largest, if not the largest, in Denmark. The Viking exhibits are something else. The history of Denmark is very well shown and described at this museum. I highly recommend the visit of this museum.",
          "Let's start with the good, or even excellent. There are some terrific exhibits here from the early Viking era, some in remarkable condition and for this reason alone it is worth a visit. There is though a 'however'. Just about everything was the way museums used to be in the",
          "This was a lovely museum! The viking exhibit was outstanding! Easy to navigate and was a day well spent.",
          "If you don\u2019t have much time to visit all the museums, choose this one! I am not a huge museum fan, but found everything that I saw and read to be fascinating and highly informative. They have a special exhibit on Genghis Khan which talks about how the nomadic people lived and",
          "The National Museum of Denmark is an amazing museum. It covers a wide range of natural and cultural history of Denmark and beyond. We left with a greatly expanded knowledge and appreciation of Denmark's land, people, and culture. The museum is quite large. We only had a few",
          "Started off in the children's museum before the Danish history sections. The museum has a lot of things to see and read. It's very engaging and well worth a visit.",
          "We made use of a 15% off voucher from our RED BUS sightseeing ticket to buy entry tickets. The museum was hugely informative and interesting with very well presented exhibits and information posters and labels in English as well as Danish. We also made use of their cafe and the",
          "Amazing exhibit of artifacts dating back to 8000BC in the pre history section. Excellent displays from the Viking era. We didn\u2019t tour everything. You\u2019d need a week to see it all. Very impressed",
          "Wow! We spent 1/2 a day here & only made from Pre-history through the Vikings. We will be coming back for more on our next visit.",
          "This museum covers beside Danish history and especially Vikings history every thinkable region, ethnic and culture and this with a impressive vast collection of artifacts and information. Ancient Chinese, Japan, Egypt, Eskimo, African tribes, ... you name it - it is covered.",
          "The visit made for a great education about Danish history - Lots of other areas of course, but glad we spent the time to learn more about this great nation and it's rich history",
          "We only had two days in Copenhagen and the first one it rained - a lot. So we made a beeline for this museum, expecting to spend an hour or two. It was great, with a lot of early history and viking artifacts and information. Before we knew it, 4 hrs had past. We ate at the",
          "One of the most extensive museums I\u2019ve been in. Particularly interesting regarding Danish history. Surprised to see such extensive history of other cultures as well.",
          "One of the most important museum in Denmark ! There are great viking\u00b4s armors, boats, knifes and axes.",
          "Nice museum with a lot of Viking stuff if you like history good stop they has visiting exhibits also try the Carlsberg museum for open garden",
          "The amount of interesting items are really big and in some cases too much. The varietty is in my opinion enough. If we need a little more detail, then we have boards were we can read a little bit more. The only downside was for me the way finding. It is confusing sometimes",
          "Aside from a brief blitz through the modern era exhibit we spent several hours in the prehistoric and Viking era exhibits on the ground floor. It was a very interesting march through history and I definitely learned a lot more about Danish history and the Viking people. It was",
          "This is an incredible museum for people interested in history and archeology. The Ice Age and Viking exhibits are particularly well done. We appreciated all the English subtitles on the descriptors. The museum lobby is free. It will give you a nice preview of the museum. The",
          "This is a wonderful museum which covers hundreds of years of Danish History. It is so interesting that I would go back just to visit this museum.",
          "Displays were well thought out and have you a gradual History of Denmark. Really enjoyed this one. Highly recommend.",
          "My husband and I spent about 2 to 2 1/2 hours in this museum, which was not far from our hotel. We learned a lot about Danish history, including the many wars that reduced Denmark from a large to a more modest geographical area. We both believe that it is important to learn",
          "the museum is incredible with the history of denmark and collections of the time of the Vikings, it has a lot of history to see in the museum, reserve a time of in the minino 4 hours to be able to all the stories and in the museum has restaurant and lockers for bags and backpacks",
          "Great museum with lots of information about the exhibits in each room. Took a long time to go round. Good info to keep children engaged as well.",
          "If you want to experience Danish history at its best, this is the place. Great arrangements and displays from all eras. Awesome Vikings displays",
          "We spent most of our last day in Copenhagen here, but we could\u2019ve spent longer! So many interesting exhibits and I really learnt a lot about Danish and Scandinavian history. But they have plenty more also - Egyptian, Roman, Asian, Native American, the list goes on! The",
          "What a wonderful experience this was! Four floors of splendid exhibits and all in English, which was needed for us! It is amazing that they were able to preserve so much, so well. They have a lovely gift shop, and a fabulous restaurant on site. The beer and open faced sandwiches",
          "This is a family friendly museum with interesting parts for everybody. It\u2019s not to serious and doable in 2 hours or so. Nice coffee, lovely shop.",
          "Recommend this museum. Good layout. Interesting for children as well as adults. I do wish we'd had more time to do it much more thoroughly. Could easily spend a whole day here.",
          "I found the exhibits relatively average, but the atrium of the museum is quite glorious and the restaurant is really good for a little snack/drink. I particularly liked the gift shop.",
          "I arrived at the Museum at 10.30 on a Sunday with a hangover and expected to spend some time at the Viking exhibit, I left at 4.30pm blown away by the collection and extremely impressed by the interpretation of the exhibits which was by the way 100% available in English. As",
          "Well thought out and organized, this is a bright, airy and modern museum. The day we went there were several children's groups as well teens. The museum seemed set up for those groups and it provided them with interesting and often eye-catching exhibits. While not the largest",
          "The national museum of Copenhagen is a real multimedia experience. Well organized and kinds friendly, with toy section just for them. It has all the history of Denmark from the prehistoric ages until the modern times. Enjoy it!!!",
          "we went there to see the Vikings Exhibit and were not disappointed. So little is known about the vikings so the exhibit was fact of wah they did know and artist imagination and how those facts could be interpreted. Well thought out exhibit.",
          "Joined the museum's guided tour on \"Meet the Danes\". Very fascinating to learn from a Danish university student sharing his perspective about the Danish culture, what is Hygge and their lifestyle. Not an overwhelmingly large museum. Can stroll easily and enjoy the Danish vibe.",
          "This museum has so much to see! We only made it through one floor. The exhibits on the ancient people and Vikings were well presented and engaging",
          "Prehistory and viking galleries were fascinating. The amount of gold and viking hoards was amazing. The rest oc the galleries were ok but felt old fashioned. Book on viking Denmark was a bit pricey but well worth the \u00a316 just fof the photos alone. The burials and bog bodies",
          "I was surprised that this was the national museum in Copenhagen as considerably smaller and less informative exhibits than most other national museums I\u2019ve been to in other cities. The Viking exhibit is the best here but I\u2019ve still seen better elsewhere. The cosplay section was",
          "If you like museums, the you should go!! There\u2019s much to see and it\u2019s a big place. Not too expensive. It was 95dkk (about 13\u20ac) from an adult.",
          "The exhibits on Meet the Vikings were very nice. The rest of the exhibits were uneven in quality and execution. We probably won't return to this museum again.",
          "This is a large modern museum in Copenhaagen It is easily found a short distance from the central train stations don't the walking street shopping area. If you buy a Copenhagen card admission is free. Currently there is a awesome show on the Vikings. It's worth a visit and a",
          "We were there more than three hours. A fantastic museum with a lot of variety. Nice to visit for families too.",
          "This place is great, it tells you all about the Danish history. It has so many antiquties to look at and lots of information on them all. They have old skeletons, horns, goblets, jewels etc. The also had an Egyptian exhibit which was very interesting. There is a nice gift shop",
          "We decided to go for the guided tour. Absolut worth the money as you sail unhindered through. Expert guide so you dont waist time reading the most informative boards, just get the feeling. And there is no Bull if your guide does not have the answer he will say so. Disappointment",
          "The exhibits tell the history of the danish people dating back to early archeological ruins to the present day. I liked how the museum focused on storytelling- you got a sense of the people- no matter the timeframe- and not just the objects. I was especially impressed and",
          "Very comprehensive museum with a walk through Danish history.Would allow 2/3 hours to do justice. Nicely takes you through Danish history century by century. Limited cafe compared with what Copenhagen offers. Lovely indoor look to building.",
          "We went to the museum as it was near our hotel and on the Copenhagen card. We got there early so we could do the \u201cMeet the Danes\u201d tour. Our guide was really friendly and took us through a few of the modern exhibitions. We then spent a good couple of hours wandering around the",
          "We got there fairly late, so didn't have as much time as we would have liked, but the Viking exhibit, in particular, was excellent and I felt that I learned a lot about the country.",
          "This was my least enjoyable experience in Copenhagen, it's a confusing building and one that visitors could easily find difficult to get out of as we did. The Viking information was interesting however and well done.",
          "Well worth a few hours\u2019 visit. The cafe is excellent, too, if you need to stop in the middle. There\u2019s lots to see and clear explanations in both Danish and - helpfully - English.",
          "A very spacious museum with a caf\u00e9/restaurant on the 1st floor. Everyone who goes will want to see the Viking exhibits, which are on the first floor. However, the museum covers far more of Denmark's history than just the Vikings, and also has interesting exhibits of aboriginal",
          "We started with the Viking exhibits, just fantastic!! Some of the finds were of excellent quality and it is truly amazing how they had been left buried for so long and look like brand new, I was enthralled by the woven necklaces that were made of very fine gold wire - just",
          "Interesting for all ages. In a nice way it introduces you with Danes and Vikings. I spent most of the time in a room with house dolls. And I am over 10y. :)",
          "Lots of Viking exhibits and kids interactive play areas with authentic chain mail and helmets. Our 10 year old was at max age for this but four and six year old cousins were in prime. Only saw a fraction of the rest of the museum which is massive. Without the kids I could have",
          "This is quite your typical national museum with national treasures and stuff collected around the world. The newest addition is a viking display which is quite good and with all texts in both Danish and English. I also rather like the \"People of the world\" exhibition. It is a",
          "With fantastic interactive displays and well-presented objects, this museum is a must when in Denmark\u2019s Capital. From the novice to the expert of Viking history you will not be disappointed. Highlights include The woman from Huldremose, the Gundestrup-kedlen, the Kongens",
          "A visit gives you an idea of Denmark's history . Find 2-3 hours to spend for this . Unfortunately there are relatively few exhibits for Vikings.",
          "Learn all about Danish history in this museum: prehistory with many fine golden and silver objects, Denmark\u2019s colonial past, displays of furniture, china, watches etc. You can spend all day here. The New exhibition of the Vikings is excellent.",
          "This museum is just amazing and very interesting place too, I just loved this place and provide knowledge also",
          "I enjoyed going to see and learn more about certain periods in history. I think it is well done so that everyone can have a great day. It is the national history museum so I took my time to get around to see, as there was many people like me in to see.",
          "If you want to learn more about the Viking this is a place to visit. Very interesting exhibition not boring at all. The museum also presents egyptian or grec pieces that are really beautiful. Entrance fee is not expensive and you can have delicious cakes and good coffee after",
          "If you already know a lot about Danish history, this might be a good museum to visit for you. However, my family and I did not know very much prior to our visit and left even more confused. The poor layout of the museum felt like it had us skipping hundreds of years from exhibit",
          "Really bad directions, I got lost many times, difficult to find an exit. I felt like in a maze most of the time more than a Museum. Overpriced! Not exiting exhibitions during that time. Staff a bit bitter.",
          "I enjoyed this and learned alot about Danish history. However if you are right on time, do a walking tour instead.",
          "All the lockers were taken. The exhibition meet the vikings was small but interesting. The ancieny near eastern department (egypt) was lovely and quiet.",
          "We spent a couple of hours visiting this very interesting museum, and learned a lot about Danish history through the Pre-history exhibit which included the Sun Chariot, The Egtved Girl and the Rune Stones There were many other interesting exhibits but we needed a break so",
          "The National Museum is an excellent way to spend 4-6 hours while in Copenhagen. They have an exceptional exhibition on life in Scandinavia from pre-history through the viking age on the first floor. My youngest daughter loved the Children's Exhibit, and my eldest daughter",
          "I went there to check out an extrondinary and a must see viking exhibition by Jim Lyngvild, which I found was done rather respectful and with a great contribution. If you want to grab your lunch in the Cafe Sm\u00f6r I would highly recommended you to reserve a table in advance as a",
          "You could absolutely spend a day here. The restaurant and cafe were lovely. Lots of school children visiting. Must be amazing for them to have this on their doorstep.",
          "A very well done museum that takes you from the Stone Age to modern Denmark. There are artifacts and remains found in bogs that are centuries old. The interpretation of the Vikings is terrific. The recreations of Danes\u2019 living spaces through the decades is instructive.",
          "National museum is a must visit place. U will get to know in-depth knowledge of danish history, culture and a lot more. It\u2019s really well maintained and preserved. Full marks to the management.",
          "From the prehistory to the Christiana construction, an impressive collection of art objects and proofs. A long but worthy visit.",
          "Happily spent a few hours looking through the displays of the different ages. Fascinating artefacts including some Egyptian mummies. Spacious and well thought out. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "This was one of the last places we visited before our journey home. We entered about 11:00, our Copenhagen Card ran out at 12:00. We managed to work out the free lockers in the foyer and decided to start at the top and work downwards. The lifts were big and smooth making the",

          "Upon visiting the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, it was an epic place of interactive learning and history. Showcase their amazing history of Denmark throughout its in tire time conception and presents up on the Earth. It also showcases the exhibits from Denmark\u2019s",
          "Lots to see here - we went when the vikings exhibition on and it was really good - in fact the older stuff was all good.",
          "excellent Viking exhibitions including burials, runestones and the golden chariot.Good facilities like free lockers and coat/pram locks etc for ease of attendance. Over three floors of history, and the current Meet the Vikings exhibition helps bring the history to life. well",
          "This wonderful museum is on several floors and deserves more than one visit. There is so much to see. There are cloakrooms and lockers which are a must so you can look around without hindrance. The shop is also a delight and has lots of interesting artefacts to purchase. The",
          "This is the Danish equivalent of the British Museum. Amazing place, with - currently - a super exhibition called Meet the Vikings. Lots to see, including some talking oil paintings (thought I was hallucinating....) Well worth a visit. Didn't rate the cafe which seemed more of a",

          "Eventhough I am a native of DK and live close to Copenhagen I try to go here regularly. The viking exibition is well worth a visit, but so is there permanent exibition, so make sure to swing by.",
          "This was a very interesting museum. We took a tour with a guide that was called meet the Danes and it gave great insight to the typical life of a local. It covered some history and our guide answered questions for us. We also saw the special exhibit on vikings. It was",
          "We went last week on a rainy day with our daughter and 3 little children. It's an very interesting museum packed full of exhibits. The children's area was huge with so much for them to do. There is a discount on the adult's price if you take a child which was an added bonus.",
          "After several visits to this Museum between 1999 and 2018 we finally saw the Gunderstrup Caldron - the largest known piece of iron age silver work. Those Viking helmets with horns? They are actually from 1500BC, about 2000 years before the Vikings. Don't miss this museum.",
          "We went to see the Wiking exebition - fantastic decorations and setup. Interesting to read about how they lived and worked. How they went out in the world and behaved badly.",
          "The National Museum is rather large and has a huge collection of items from all different time periods all over the world. There was a good amount of text (in English) to complement the vast array of items, but it wasn't overwhelming and you didn't feel like you had to read",
          "the information of Denmark and Sweden in History was marvellous.It also shows the history of Holland and Denmark",
          "This museum is fantastic and a venue not to be missed. The artifacts are amazing and the linear layout is helpful so that perionds can be placed in time. The \"Meet the Vikings\" was on when we visited and it was was absolutely fantastic. I've never seen such wonderful aritfacts",
          "We enjoyed learning about the Vikings and the cosplay exhibition was interesting. There\u2019s a lot of pre historic exhibitions. The set up of the museum is lovely with lots of light in the central area.",
          "The museum is laid out on 3 floors. The exhibits are numbered 1-270 or so. Despite this it is easy to get lost and you can pass back and forth between exhibits. The ground floor has the oldest exhibits and time advances as you go up. The museum presents a history of the",
          "Take your time to stroll through ancient Dane history, to more recent times. The artifacts, household goods, artwork, and munitions displays are very well done. Some guided tours are included if you register for the available time slots.",
          "Went for a short brunch and visited the museum afterwards. It was very interesting and easy to move around. Lots of kids but still quiet and lots of sight and sounds to relish. 2 hours.",
          "We stopped here because it was listed pretty high on the list if things to do in DK and it was indoors. We should have gone a little earlier because we were rushed getting through before closing (arrived at 3:45). Very interesting and would recommend for anyone. Paid 95 dk per",
          "We only visited as we had an hour to spare before we travelled home. You could have spent a lot longer. There is a children\u2019s museum on the ground floor and you start on the ground floor with Viking, Romans etc and then work your way up the museum until you get to the 1990\u2019s. It",

          "Great place to visit, there is a exhibition on vikings at the moment which is well worth a visit. The rest of the museum covers the creation of Denmark and has some interesting artefacts.",
          "This museum is one of the amazing museums I visited. It has plenty of items to see and explains perfectly the history of Denmark. There is another part which gives an idea about other countries and cultures. It is really worth the visit.",
          "Lots to see in the museum with plenty of rest break areas to sit down. Be sure to hang your coat up when you go in as it gets a little stuffy",
          "Went on an english-language guided tour that took you through some of the museum's exhibits and related Denmark's history to its modern citizens. Also had a very popular Vikings exhibit as a special temporary attraction, that part of the museum was quite a bit more busy than the",
          "Copenhagen Card to the win. This is the museum to visit if you like history prior to 1660. I was amazed at how advanced the people were in this location at each phase in history relative to other areas I have visited. Their stone age ax heads and barbed fishing spears were",
          "My 10 yr old son and I went to the museum specifically to see the Vikings exhibition. I found it very interesting but a lot of the exhibits required a fair bit of reading which turned my son off. Unfortunately we had noticed the Ripleys Believe it or not museum on the way to",
          "My son and I visited the museum and spent a great deal of time there. The section of early history and the development of early Denmark was our favorite.",
          "The number of items the Museum holds is really impressive, and it was interesting to learn about Danes throughout the ages. However we found the museum a bit random - there was no clear starting point and after half the ground floor exhibition we realised we were doing it",
          "This museum is a bit like a labyrinth, there is too many exhibits that are cramped in tiny rooms. You easily lose the overview and route around the floors and different categories. The corridors are so narrow people have to wait all the time to get from one room to another.",
          "I have planned the visit for 1-2 hours and finally stood there 4-5. Of course as many other foreigners I was curious about the Vikings but the museum has so much more to offer. Especially if you go with kids - look for the yellow box with a big button in various rooms - the",
          "Well worth a visit. Some very interesting displays, especially the Viking gold exhibition - amazing workmanship! Lovely place to hang out and have bite to eat as well.",
          "There is so much to see inside the museum and with us visiting near the end of the day we didn't get chance to see it all. Such a good variety as well, something for everyone. The only downside was not having enough explanations as to what things were.",
          "The National Museum has a very nice display of VIkings the other exhibition are less familiar however still worth the visit",
          "This was my first visit to the national museum. I was very impressed. Compared to London museums it was practically empty. There was plenty of exhibits to look at and the fact it is not massively busy made it much easier to enjoy the exhibits and learn about them. The Viking",
          "Great Viking exhibition. Even if you only go for that! Wonderful works well preserved and displayed with interesting and informative panels. Stunning foyer area with beautifully crafted staircase. Feel the banister rails!",
          "We visited for a couple of hours with teenagers on the proviso that if they did this we would allow them a couple of hours shopping time in return. There were lots of great exhibits laid out with good english information. We visited the ground floor and the second floor before",
          "Great layout. East to follow signs and great information. I don\u2019t normally like museums but really enjoyed the history in this one.",
          "THe display of Danish pre-history is outstanding as was the Vikings exhibition. The rest was a bit disappointing but still worth a 2-3 hour visit. Free lockers that work! British Museum could learn a few things from them",
          "This is the museum to go to if you want to understand and appreciate the history of Denmark from the Viking age to the early 2000s. The world-class displays are spread over 4 floors and can easily occupy you for the entire day. I personally enjoyed the Stories of Denmark",
          "If you're like me and could live in a museum, this is one you might want to consider visiting. The Viking artifacts from DK are fascinating and impressive. Danish history is through all time periods.",
          "Very well designed and organized museum. Wasn\u2019t super busy which was nice and very easy to get around exhibitions I was also nice to see all the Scandinavian exhibits both modern and ancient",
          "Take the time to explore this amazing museum. Artifacts from all over the world and through time will amaze.",
          "You can easily spend 2-3 hours roaming through here. They have displays about the stone ages, toys from the 20th century, culture in the 1980's, etc... We really enjoyed the variety and all the information that came with each section.",
          "I never saw so much gold in one place it was great my granddaughter was over the moon lots to see u could stay as long as u needed",
          "To tourists who know pretty much nothing about Denmark history. This is the point to start. It takes us through the history of Denmark through the exhibits. There are interactive exhibits makes the museum attractive and fun.",
          "Easy to find, polite staff. Good displays too. A great display on hunter gatherers there and all the displays had an English description too, which helped massively.",
          "Family Friendly museum, the perfect place to visit with a couple hours of your time. Don't forget to take a brochure to guide you.",
          "beautiful building, old on the outside but modern on the inside. the museum has a lot of different and interesting exhibits and a great children area with small buildings and costumes for the children to play with. the guides are very competent, and it is possible to get guides",
          "One of the exhibits was not available during our visit, but we still found plenty of wonderful art to absorb. It was a well spent afternoon. Added to the pleasure of the museum was the fact that everyone was friendly, helpful, informative and spoke English quite well.",
          "It is a pretty decent national museum and it gives a nice review of the whole danish history. I really liked the fact that we are guided through history in a chronological order room by room. There are some remarkable exhibits and overall it was a nice experience. The museum is",
          "Nationalmuseet is a place witch worth to visit if someone visit Copenhagen.We visited that place together with my family .",
          "Prepare to take a few hours here. The lower level provided a great insight into Danish history. A small yet very impressive Egyptian display. I was amazed by the Greek & Roman artefacts. A lot of artefacts from Rhodes and mosaics from Syria. I was left wondering when the",
          "Really found the ground floors covering iron, Bronze Age interesting. The Viking section was surprisingly small. Also the danish colonial era is worth looking at especially being a foreigner who hasn\u2019t heard about Denmark\u2019s history. All signs are in English and Danish. I did",
          "We spent a whole afternoon here and barely touched the place. there\u2019s such a diverse collection of items here, from dolls houses to Viking items to traditional tribal outfits from across the globe. We ended up rushing at the end to try and see everything we wanted to. Would",
          "This National Museum has a big collection of different things for many areas. The Egypt-area is huge. You need at least 3 to 4 hours, if you want to see everything in a quick way. If you want to read all the information, you might need more time.",
          "The collection of danish culture on the bottom floor is well worth a visit. The children's museum is also interesting albeit a little politically incorrect... The top floors which house the egytian, greek, roman and early christian art are nice but not enough signs in english.",
          "An interesting museum about the emergence of the Danes from the Stone Age onwards. However the colonial period was skimmed over as if this period didn\u2019t have much impact on the world. Or indeed there was an air of pride when talking about the seventh most successful colonial",
          "We enjoyed our visit , thought the displays were great especially the dollhouses in the history of toys. We ate lunch at the cafe it was good but the service was very slow.",
          "This was the best museum I visited in Copenhagen, offering a well presented history of Denmark from the Stone Age to the present with outstanding artifacts including a substantial number of Rune Stones. Even a casual museum person will enjoy a few hours here. A little",
          "My husband and I were very interested in the displays at the museum and we found the building itself inspiring. Given our limited time (only about 90 minutes), we focused on the more recent history of Denmark (from the 1600's through 2000). We learned a great deal about",
          "I always like visiting museums about the history of a country. This museum is more 'general', I was especially disappointed about the Viking section. Unfortunately it just told the same story about the stone age etc. but nothing in particular about the Danish people..",
          "New exhibits on Middle Ages danish history. The museum is a pleasant way to view danish history and culture. Exhibits are well done and worth the time.",
          "This museum is worth visiting and i would say a must to understand in detail about the history of Denmark. Keep in mind that the collection is so big and if you are planning to look into each items then it may take a whole day. Lifts are available so its easy for those with baby",
          "If you\u2019re short on time, just check out the prehistory section, starting around room 9 thru the Romans and Vikings. They do a great job of explaining in very short signs. The colonial voices section upstairs is also interesting for a look at how Denmark is dealing with former",
          "I find it fascinating to visit a country's national museum and this didn't disappoint me. I wasn't that entirely interested in the stone/bronze/iron age section and wish I knew the 1600-2000 section was upstairs so I could've skipped that. I really enjoyed the 1600-2000 section",
          "There is so much to see in this museum that will help you understand Denmark's history and role in the region over the ages. We spent about 90 minutes there, but easily could have spent 1/2 the day. Admission is included as part of the Copenhagen Card.",
          "The museum is much larger than it looks from the entry hall, you could easily spend a day here; in fact, if you were to look at every point of interest in the museum, you probably would be at the museum the whole day. The museum is spacious and is spread over three floors. For",
          "Housed in several floors of a former palace and renovated so that a central atrium rendered the space with much illumination and brightness (but which also made it quite hot on the very sunny autumn morning when we visited), this museum gave us much insight into the history of",
          "Our family visited The National Museum of Denmark on a Sunday and joined free guided tour in English. This tour took us through the history of Denmark in one hour, and afterwards we looked at the most interesting exhibitions on our own. Golden horns and well preserved bog bodies",
          "Be sure to find out when free tour is available in your language. we enjoyed that and made sure we arrived on that day. Very large museum",
          "this was a great way to learn the basics of Danish history, and the cafe had great food and drink. Very pleasant, especially on a rainy day.",
          "Bronze age, iron age, vikings, Egyptian mummies, Danish history, this place has it all! The gift shop is good as well. And it is free!",
          "A good Viking history for someone (like me) with almost no knowledge of the Vikings. A lot of artefacts on display showing Danish history. Not a huge museum but well worth a visit.",
          "Loved this place! We expected to only go to the Viking section as we didn't have a lot of time. We ended up seeing the whole place. This has a jaw dropping amount of pre history, iron age, and Viking history objects, bodies, jewelry, clothing, tools, objects, and musical",
          "Due to a late flight we arrived only one hour before closing time at 5:00. In that hour we did toured the archaeological section \"Prehistory to the Viking Age\" with a little time for the gift shop. It is about a five minute walk from the Palace Hotel/City Hall. Head west from",
          "Worth a visit and the great thing is that the tickets are valid for the entire day - so you can always come back later. Staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable.",
          "I visited the museum while my husband was attending a business meeting. It was interesting learning about Denmark and it\u2019s history. It was a little challenging following the timeline, but I eventually figured it out.",
          "This museum has numerous exhibits starting with the stone age. There are exhibits from China, native American and modern day. One needs to allow several hours to visit.",
          "We spent wo hours in the Prehistory Exhibits. They have extensive collections of flints, stone tools, bone and metal artifacts as well as videos demonstrating how some of these were made. Because Denmark has many bogs, and bogs are the ideal environment for preserving both",
          "We had visited this museum on a previous trip to Denmark so we already knew how good it was. This time we bought a season pass for one person which allows two people to visit. We are very glad we did because it allowed us to really explore the museum over a number of days. Our",
          "We were hoping to see vikiing artefacts and were not disappointed. The section an Early Danish culture is wonderful",
          "The museum comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures, alike. I didn't manage to view everything as there was so mush to see and absorb, set aside a couple of half-days! After a couple of hours I went up to their cafe for delicious cake and coffee.",
          "This museum is one of the best organized I've ever seen. One room leads logically to the next, both in subject matter and time. While the focus is on Denmark, I was surprised to see significant exhibits about humans and their creations from around the world and throughout",
          "There are exhibits on everything from Stone Age people in Denmark, to 21st century culture. You could easily spend 2 full days here. I suggest, picking few topics that are of most interest to you and focus on those. Fascinating and interesting displays.",
          "Allow 2-3 hours, it's very interesting and informative, well worth the visit. There are human remains in part of the exhibition, but all tastefully done.",
          "lots to see. takes a few hours to get through. nice place to lunch. Copenhagen card got us in for free. very encompassing for history",
          "There is a great collection of historical information here. We were limited to two hours because we arrived late afternoon. We could have enjoyed a longer visit. The museum offers fascinating exhibits covering the stone age to modern times.",
          "This is one of the best museums I've ever been to. It has a very extensive history of Denmark, going from the stone age all to modern day. The extensive range of artifacts is phenomenal and it is everything you would want in national museum",
          "While this museum is not especially large it is a place where you can spend several hours viewing the works of masters from Denmark as well elsewhere in Europe.",
          "This museum charts the cultural history of Denmark. It is well organised over 4 levels and is arranged by themes such as Denmark in the Middle Ages, The Renaissance, Peoples of the World and Stories of Denmark. There is also a Childrens section. The admission ticket (95Dkk)",
          "This museum is split up into distinct sections and has a lot of items from other areas outside of Denmark/Europe. My mom and I enjoyed the interactiveness of the museum and the many unique items that we had never seen from any other museum. I would recommend to spend at least 2",
          "Be sure to take a tour of this great museum, a must if you are vistiing Copenhagen. Includes interesting ancient middle-eastern artifacts from Danish expeditions. THere is an interesting collection of contemporary cultural pieces that presents a view of the devleopment of",
          "The exhibits are well grouped and if you follow the suggested route take you from early cave dwellings to present day. The basics, there are free locking lockers, clean restrooms, a lovely restuarant, and a typical museum gift shop. The ticket was 95 krone/$13.72. At the time of",
          "If you like history and very well documented ancient artifacts (first floor) this is the place for you. Other two floors were somewhat less impressive. Spent almost 3 hours but still couldn\u2019t cover the entire fist floor.",
          "Located in the prince\u2019s former palace, the museum has a large collection of Viking, Bronze Age and medieval artefacts as well as many other eras, including Egyptian mummies. Our visit was unplanned and would recommend you allow at least 3 hours minimum to see a lot I feel the",
          "Allow plenty of time and be prepared to put up with rude staff. You will be rewarded with a lot of interesting exhibits, very well curated and laid out.",
          "Gives a good historical perspective but we felt it was overwhelming - so many things to see. Nice building.",
          "I had limited time. Sadly that meant missing the Viking section BUT we saw a fascinating exhibition on colonialism and the wars with neighbouring scandi countries. You\u2019ll leave feeling like you\u2019ve learnt more about this part of the world than before.",
          "Museum is compact, but contains a lot of expositions covering period from stone age to modern times. I missed a broader view on medieval times, as it was concentrated very much on Christianity. Also it would be nice to have possibility to rent an audio guide, but it is not",
          "It\u2019s a nice museum provided you take the guided English tour which is well done and well spoken. Takes you through the museum which can be quite confusing and not do well laid out. You can spend two hours here and then sit in the lobby and enjoy ice cream with free WiFi.",
          "A great museum, nicely laid out, with descriptions/labels in English as well as Danish. The cauldron was what we came to see, and it was breathtaking, but there's plenty of other wonderful and fascinating things. The ground floor contains all the prehistoric, early historic, and",
          "A lot of things to see here. infact if you are time tight you need to be brutal with how much time you spend where. We were more interested in the actual Danish history etc, rather than the artifacts from around the world so were able to slice off at least 1/3rd of the total",
          "If you are a fan of Danish mid-century design, especially chairs, you must visit this museum. Examples from all the very best designers. Plus very interesting clothes, household objects, etc.",
          "On arrival to the ticket desk we learned there were free guided tours available of the highlights of the museum. We luckily arrived just before one began and there was still space to join the 1 hour tour. From the lobby guide took us all over showing us important pieces in the",
          "The museum can be confusing to navigate but there is so much to see you should really allocate at least 3 hours, possibly more, if you want to see everything.",
          "It is a beautifully presented museum with plenty to see for different tastes.. many sections, so will take a couple of hours if you visit all of them and of course do choose to read some of the info.. Great experience, Go early to avoid human traffic , it is also closed on",
          "Our kids really enjoyed the children\u2019s area here. It\u2019s in need of a bit of an update but overall it\u2019s lots of fun and very hands on! Great place to spend a rainy day",
          "Such a variety of topic to follow and view. Not only Eskimo, but many other indigenous peoples to observe in terms of artefacts and photography. Coupled with the Danish history you can easily spend the day here.",
          "The National Museum is Denmark's state-of-the-art cultural history main museum and encompasses both the history of Danish and foreign cultures. It is housed in the Prince's Palace at Frederiksholms Kanal in Copenhagen.",

          "My husband and I visited this museum as part of the Copenhagen card 24-hour pass (gained admission right at the cusp of the final hour mid-day before it expired!). We opted for a free tour with a local Dane once we arrived. This turned out to be a great experience to hear",
          "Only had 1.5 hrs before closing so I quickly started on floor 1 and got a whirlwind tour from pre-Viking era thru present times. Great acknowledgement of colonial past and interesting exhibits",
          "This large museum is a must see if you are visiting Copenhagen. It was lovely to learn about Danish history and plenty to see as well. All set on 3 floors,it can be a bit confusing which way to go. Large bags and backpacks are to be left in free lockers and i was given a paper",
          "We saved this for a rainy day. It was really close to our hostel and a perfect way to spend the afternoon as it was raining a lot. Really interesting artifacts. Worth it",
          "Found this as we left the back entrance from Tivoli gardens. Well worth looking around the paintings but some eyptian mummies as well on display",
          "Great exhibits on Pre historic Danes, Bog people, Vikings & rune stones. Great museu for newbies to Denmark to get a sense of the country. We loved the almost modern art display of bronze ceremonil horns in the pre history section.",
          "Honestly, I'm surprised by the great reviews. We only saw the pre-historic section. The collection is impressive, but there is only sparse information and the exhibits are poorly designed-- video is projected in rooms filled with sunshine so that you cannot see it. Bog bodies",
          "The Museum is divided into Pre Historic, Viking (1660 - 1900) and Modern Denmark, The Guided Tour is recommended",
          "We made our way through the historical rooms and joined a free English tour by a local university student (called Meet the Danes). This was a fantastic way to gather some insight about history, culture, life, society, politics etc in Denmark! Highly recommend! Ours was 1.30pm",
          "A nice change from other activities in Copenhagen. Set aside a day if you\u2019re into history, half a day if you want a quick look. Take the guided tour, it\u2019s free last about an hour and is very informative in a relaxed way.",
          "You could spend all day here, learn a lot and have a decent lunch. Dont forget to trawl the shop afterwards.",
          "Went on the last day of our trip. Interesting displays of history. Perticularly licked the dollhouse display and the more current exhibits. Started at the prehistoric era and ended in the 1980s.",
          "What could have been a great experience was tampered by the misleading information and unhelpful staff. We arrived and told go check in for tour (we did) but then told full, and we can't tag along (not sure why the capacity issue) there was lots of space. Exhibit itself is",
          "The National Museum of Denmark is definitely worth a visit, with some really interesting exhibits. I would recommend the People of the World and Stories of Denmark exhibitions. Some of the other sections are a bit repetitive. Most of the sections are arranged chronologically,",
          "Learning about the Viking Period was a lot of fun and the exhibits were very well done and explained. I add the exhibit was large. Other areas of the museum addressed Danish History, the good, bad, and ugly presented factually and comprehensively including the Danish colonies",
          "Plenty to see but surprisingly hot inside on a summer day. A lot of different exhibitions, from vikings to egyptian mummies, for a reasonable entry fee.",
          "Very nice museum, well worth a visit. Have a plan, though, of what you want to see because the museum is absolutely huge. We just went in and started wondering and later wished we had methodical to have more time in certain areas. Their 'Meet the Danes' tour was great and I",
          "National Museum was definitely one of the best historical museums i have ever visited. It was just excellent! So many fantastic artifacts and rare finds. Just the bronze exposition and bog bodies are enough for a great experience, but it has so much more! The medieval halls and",

          "This is the museum for learning about the Danish history. So much to see and enjoy. There is an hourly free tour which I would highly recommend. There are so much information given and main exhibits pointed out on the tour. There is a restaurant. Free lockers using 4 digits code",
          "I would think most National Museum is a must for tourist, and that's why I ended up here. The day we went, was a summer day, and it was definitely stuffy, which made us felt very tired. They feature not just Denmark's art or collections, but also artifacts from other countries.",
          "For a good overview of the country\u2019s history start here. They have a one hour \u201cHighlights\u201d tour which could very well be six hours because there are so many highlights. Great artifacts, from 7-800+ years ago.",

          "The National Museum is spread over four floors, but I found the top and bottom ones most interesting. The ground floor contains finds from Denmark from pre-historic to Viking times, including several \u201cbog people\u201d (mummified naturally by having been buried in peat bogs), and",
          "We used our Copenhagen card to spend a couple of hours here exploring the museum. My two boys 11 and 9 enjoyed the children's area. There were many interactive exhibits such as an old school, kitchen, and boat that the boys could climb on. We all enjoyed the different exhibits",
          "It was truly a panorama of the past coming to life, reinforcement of previous knowledge and most importantly, a lot of new learning of region's history and how the same old 'enemies' co-exist as global citizens. The artefacts and exhibits on display enlighten us about the",

          "This musuem has wonderful artifacts. Very user friendly. It tells you the history of Denmark in an information fashion. Good deal and worth the visit",
          "I first visited some 40 years ago, and in common with many other museums elsewhere, its presentation was very dry and uninteresting. A whole new broom now presents a timeline and narrative that makes it a must for visitors to Copenhagen. There are free tours in English",
          "No air conditioning other than in the children\u2019s museum. Hot. Hot. Hot. Cafe is way overpriced. Have to store everything in lockers and use their strollers, like all the other museums. We spent 2 hours in the children\u2019s museum. It is small and most families were there less",

          "Spent 6 hours here and it wasn't enough time, there's so much to see, not just Danish heritage but Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Scandinavian in fact from all over the world. If you don't mind skipping some bits you probably could do it in a day. Some displays were lacking in ticket",

          "Fun place to walk around with a diverse collection. The lighting of objects is not always great, and sometimes you really have to search for a description.\nThey have a no bag policy, and plenty of free lockers where you can store your belongings.",
          "The museum does an excellent job of telling the story of history; the exhibits and artifacts are well-curated to illustrate Denmark's history from ancient until modern times. I find many history museums to be somewhat disjointed--curated \u2026",
          "A very interesting museum. I just recommend. Funny to see admission fee for adult 10 DKK. Adult with a kid under 18 together for both 90 DKK. Congrats Danish people, really great idea, thank you. \ud83d\udca1",
          "What a fantastic place to know more about history and specifically Viking and Nordic history. They also periodically host exhibitions, so that's wonderful. Conveniently located close to the city center.",
          "Big museum that takes you through the full history of Denmark. Lots of interesting exhibits, but not that smartly curated. It feels like they have every singe item on display, instead of carefully choosing the best item that represents the era.",
          "The museum is quite big so you should reserve at least 2 to 3 hours to have a comfortable experience. Very nice and informative exhibitions especially the \"meet the vikings\" one and the one about danish colonies. Staff as basically anywhere in Copenhagen is very nice, friendly and helpful.",
          "Childrens museum here was absolutely fantastic, they can touch & play with everything. My boys loved dressing up as Vikings and playing, such a great way to teach history to our children!",
          "History at it is very best. To keep it simple. From the first of times to the newest new Nationalmuseet is the place for danish history. This means Vikings, Stone age the Reformation and how Denmark as it is came to be. A treasure trove of \u2026",
          "Very informative. Very interesting permanent and changing exhibitions. Explanations in Danish and English. Bring the kids! Lots of things to do for all ages. Big museum shop. Caf\u00e9 and restaurants.\nEntry prices rather steep!",
          "A really intereating museum. We did two exhibits, the first with a guide told us about the Vikings, and then we did 1600 to 2000 which charts the evolution of Denmark as we find it now. This really was a great way to get a rapid history lesson. There's more to see than that and the museum has two cafes and a gift shop.",
          "Lots to see and do in this place and very interesting exhibits. However, I didn't like the fact that they didn't have arrows telling you where to start because I would find myself in the middle of an exhibit instead of the beginning so I'd have to back track on every floor. This is good museum for all ages.",
          "Amazing place to visit, with a comprehensive history of Denmark. Highly recommended. The Viking exhibit is AWESOME!",
          "Wow... Only things. This is container of things sorted by a few periods. Not a museum. No stories. No contexts. No questions to make you curious. Wow. So bad. No modern, interesting or engaging methods used for presentation or story \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful and full of history museum. It will take about 2 days to take the whole tour but you will not regret it!",
          "You have to spare time for this big museum. Especially the part about Vikings was very interesting. It has a nice cafe and museum shop in it. Loved it.",
          "Reknown and noteworthy museum with many original exhibitions every year.  In 2019 the main theme was the Central Asia history and cultures. Moreover the venue is home for every kind of artifacts, during the ages in the kingdom of Denmark. Very interesting, also interactive with sound and visuals in every room. 10/10 for me\ud83d\ude0e",
          "Do not miss this museum if you are in Copenhagen. I spent a few hours in this amazing museum and barely scratched the surface. \n\nI\u2019m not going to reiterate what you can or cannot experience here, there is the internet for that. I will say that the people who work there are super friendly and that I will be back!",
          "A lot of stuff ... From the Viking and bronze age to today's history.... That's amazing. I will come back to finish the full tour of the museum...",
          "Prepare yourself for a long and entertaining history lesson where you choose the subjects. One needs to dedicate enough time for this visit because the museum is big enough and rich as well. Lots of information inside and I found out that \u2026",
          "Absolutely brilliant, It was a nice museum, Huge museum with a lot to see... I really liked visiting the National Museum of Denmark. Very interesting permanent and changing exhibitions.",
          "Brilliant prehistoric collection though I think most tourists will visit for the viking stuff. But so much more. Including the remarkable sun chariot.",
          "After reading other reviews, I realized that this museum used to be free! Well, now there IS AN ADMISSION CHARGE of about $15. This is a really nice museum, with a lot to keep you busy for several hours. \n\nPROS: \n\n1) Photography is allowed, \u2026",
          "Interesting objects telling the story of the land. Outstanding large ethnography collections from other countries. Impressing exhibition of toys. Beautiful precious things and interiors from old times. And it's really big, you can go \u2026",
          "Incredible museum with amazing pieces from Greek, Roman, Etruscan origins including pottery, weapons, marble statues and everything in between. Mongol exhibit was additionally creative, interesting and very fun. Special bonus is students \u2026",
          "I ended up spending close to 4 hours here and didnt even finish everything. Start at the bottom and move your way up to follow the timeline they try to highlight. Lots of items on exhibit with Danish and English captions. Good to go, learn \u2026",
          "Amazing place which can amazed kids like adult. Pretty deep expo about viking !",
          "A new environment for \"Solvognen\". This included (today) the \"boredom button\" and a light, sound and visual experience. More and more on the museum comes out of the past dusty and boring museum and into a modern experience of a liverly museum. \nKeep up the modernization process.",
          "The museum has interesting exhibition about pre-history, the vikings, arts and culture of different ethnicities, post-colonialism, slavery... there is no audio guide, but the collection was rather well-curated. The museum is definitely worth going.",
          "The National museum is very important, but appears as a strange collection of artifacts from other cultures and some from danish history. The viking exhibition and ancient Denmark is section is good, but while the rooms on other cultures \u2026",
          "Very big collections..took us half day to finish \ud83d\ude02.Love it but we are little bit lost several time..some room is so random. It will be better if they make one way to make sure we are not missed anything..they have room numbers but yeah still a bit confusing",
          "I really liked visiting the national Museum of Denmark because it gives you a lot of insight into the history of the country and the Vikings. You could easily spent almost an entire day here. The entrance to the museum is including the \u2026",
          "Really worth to see it. Reserve at least 6 hours for that place. It has very pleasant caffeteria.",
          "The layout of the place is confusing, but they have some unique exhibits. One of the highlights is the collection of beautiful dollhouses. They are displayed so you can walk round the back to scrutinise the insides.",
          "Get ready to know about Denmark all. Also a lot of interesting exhibitions about culture, dresses, religion all the world. You might enjoy Cafe there, comfortable sofas for have some rest. Few hours at least you will need for see all)",
          "A lovely museum. They had a Halloween haunted house in the basement and a really sweet the-nightime-can-be-scary exhibit for younger children. The Danish history exhibits were extensive and well-displayed.",
          "A rather large museum ,\nLots to see. Could spend a full day there easily",
          "Nice collection and information. Kids have some interesting things too, a very good outing. Surprised to see ganesh and kalika statues in the museum",
          "Awesome, huge range of exhibitions and very well done.  Good for families, either whole in part.",
          "My family and friends enjoyed a visit to this museum very much.  We were very impressed with the artifacts and information of the Meet the Vikings exhibits.  So much to see and and good information detailing all the pieces of history that \u2026",
          "Absolutely brilliant, enough for a full day even if you don't want to do everything. A good few things for children as well. Restaurant inside has lovely food.",
          "Impressive museum. It is huge, so unless you have a lot of time, you need to pick what you want to see. It's a walk through history of mankind pinpointed to this region",
          "5 stars for artifacts, there are many.  1 star for organization and maps.  3 stars for information.  I was very interested in seeing the information about Vikings, but ended up writing things down to look up what they were used for.  They \u2026",
          "Fantastic place, a lot of interesting knowledge on Danemark and so on...",
          "Had too much fun there. Would not recommend. Could not see everything in one day. Also tickets are way too cheap for what you get. I'll Never again plan a one day trip to this museum.",
          "I spent 5 hours here soaking in the different exhibitions and learning world history. \n\nInitially expected it to be only about Danish history and was pleasantly surprised that there were really good records of history from around the world. \n\nI particularly liked the part of the museum that was for children. It\u2019s so lovely.",
          "Remember to make sure you have plenty of time here. It's very big and it takes a while to get through everything. The viking part is by far the best I have seen them so far. Very detailed and the temperature of the rooms is perfect. A great experience for me ! Even if you're danish !!",
          "Great guides. Inspiring. Knowledge.",
          "Huge museum with a lot to see. Will take hours to go through so if you don't want it to take up type whole day, just select a few exhibits to go through. The Genghis Khan exhibition was really awesome with lots of information and multimedia presentation.",
          "Room by room explorative of Denmark in different eras. Duolingo and well organized. Although I want impressed with the articles of display, most of them looked new and unoriginal.",
          "Very interesting place with everything written in English.\nCan't fault it.",
          "The best guides. Don\u2019t miss the colonies section of the main exhibit. If you can have hot dogs with the Danes, don\u2019t miss it. A real treat to chat with Danish folk. And the hot dogs are very good.",
          "Take your time. Easily a 5 hour museum with a lot of interesting stuff. \nDetailed 15.000 BC to viking times sectuon on ground floor a must-see.",
          "Wonderful historical museum on three floors. We spent the first hour in the prehistoric and medieval periods on floor zero; including a wonderful section on Viking history. After lunch, We spent the next half hour on the second floor, floor \u2026",
          "Lost track of time! You could spend a whole day here as it's laid out so well. The permanent and temporary exhibitions are so informative. The cafe is also worth visiting as the food was exceptional.",
          "Nice to visit ..if you are enthusiastic to know more about national elements.",
          "Fascinating permanent exhibition of local history from the Stone Age to the 20th century. The collection from the Stone Age to the Viking Age is vast and incredible. The antique collection is very impressive as well. I would have given this museum 5 stars if the layout had been better.",
          "Worth every penny. I paid for two people and think if I had to pay that much for one person I'd still pay it just to see all the amazing stuff they have here.  I went to see the Mongolian exhibit and it didn't disappoint. Please go if you ever get the chance to",
          "Visited on a summer\u2019s day for a lazy stroll around the rooms.  Some of the exhibits are so amazing, the details, the craftmanship, I doubt we could create some of these things today.  Wonderful place, don't expect too much, this isn\u2019t an \u2026",
          "Interesting museum with a lot of diversity ! A bit long ... Schedule two up to three hours of your time !",
          "Tidy, organised, personnel is helpful, good tours title of the museum should have been different since it contains other civilizations too",
          "In addition to rooms of the history of Denmark, there was a huge and stunning experience of Mongolia - life on the steppes and Genghis Khan. Many creative and moving audio visuals. Included Buddhist and Shamanic ritual items.\nAlso a \u2026",
          "Great collection, bad(ish) presentation.\n\nThe collections available are extensive and great, the presentation on the other hand, needs some overthinking. All that \u201cinteractive\u201d stuff doesn\u2019t belong in a history museum, in my humble opinion. \u2026",
          "If you like Viking history this has to be the best I have seen with a huge selection of artifacts and a well laid out history. Combine this with the rest of a well organized museum and you can easily spend many hours here. Nearly all of the exhibits had both Danish and English explanations",
          "So interesting. Unexpected social history of Denmark plus all the usuals. Very pleasant restaurant.",
          "It was a nice museum.  We were there on a hot day and for some reason the air condition was not on in every part of the museum and made some of the room very stuffy.  But all-in-all, the exhibit was very nice.",
          "Nice experiance, ever fun for the babies, and the staff was very helpful",
          "Beautiful history museum. A must-see in Copenhagen.",
          "A very good selection of historical pieces and fun kinds of art as well, recommend it highly for people who like Egypt, Greek and the renaissance.\n\nA small shop as well as a restaurant inside, you can get guided tours here as well.\n\nI \u2026",
          "A beautiful museum with a huge amount of information about the Danish history and other civilizations. The displays and their descriptions are very informative. The only thing I found confusing was that the museum consists of three floors and without a tour, you can easily miss some rooms.",
          "Discover the evolution of men in the whole world while walking in this great Museum, learn about ancient cultures and have a look at the Vikings exposition. Visit the upper floors for more knowledge of past times that rumbles today as merely memories and antique relics. Decent gift shop.\nVisa, MasterCard, Cash.",
          "Vikings section alone  is worth a visit. The staff are extremely friendly. The children section is definitely worth a visit for families with children where there are pretty much no rules in this area. They are free to dress up as Vikings, \u2026",
          "Stunning! But if you want to visit this museum you will be there for half a day.",
          "Very rich history covering long era of the Scandinavia-German life and powers. Interesting details of the Vikings period and life at the time. Besides versatile subjects of world life, music etc...other subjects. Requires good several hours to cover.",
          "Features a remarkable collection of Danish prehistory. The Gundestrup Cauldron display really shows the piece off nicely. Got to love those bog bodies! The \u201cMeet the Vikings\u201d exhibit sounded like it might be a silly wax show but was actually quite striking. The sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d is  pretty good to.",
          "It's a really good museum.good if your interested in the Vikings",
          "It's lovely. Great exhibits for all ages",
          "A good museum, laid out in a logical way but there was too much to see! The early Danish history part at the beginning was the best bit. Not enough interactive exhibits, and lots of small objects - could do with fewer items on display, and more large items like the runestones",
          "Nice museum in the center of the city. On the three main floors you can see the history of Denmark. There are also several side-exhibitions which I did not see. \n\nThere are many items on display but also a lot of text and graphics to give \u2026",
          "The map said infopoint, but it was also a cashdesk, always with a queue. But there was very nice guardian who directed me. Also the christmass deco was nice.",
          "I really liked the exposition about the colonies, though I didn't see enough acknowledgement of the damage caused by colonization. The Viking exposition was also interesting.",
          "Huge and diverse collection - you need at least 3 hours to see the areas of most interest to you (there's too much to see in one visit). One star knocked off because the \"ethnographic\" display is not well presented. Split across 2 different \u2026",
          "Good place to learn about Danish, and Scandinavian history. Some artifacts from Egypt and other places are also on display.",
          "Awesome museum. A must see. You can literally walk through the history of Denmark from the very beginning until the 2000s.",
          "Great museum, not the most complete concerning the history of Vikings but still very interesting.\nI went there twice and still discovered new rooms I missed! :D",
          "Well worth the cost of admission is free if you do the Copenhagen card. Great museum great display about the Vikings great background history of the Copenhagen Denmark area",
          "Love this place ,could easily spend a whole day there ,I have always been interested in the history ,so always have a wonderful time in there , you can always get a little more educated or refreshing your memories !",
          "Lots to see and do in the national museum. I really enjoyed the journey through the ages.",
          "Really good place to learn about history and see lots of cool historical artifacts",
          "Awesome museum. We only had about 3 hours to spend there but easily could have spent all day.  Will definitely go again next time we are in Copenhagen",
          "Nice place to explore and get more knowledge about the historical stages of Denmark. The price of ticket reasonable.",
          "You can find from pre historic to modern history of Denmark and other countries including Greece and Egypt.\nYou have to be quick otherwise it will take you long...",
          "This is an interesting museum with loads to see. If you wanted to see it all you would have to put aside most of a day. The highlight for me was the section on the more ancient history of Denmark but all the halls I went into were very interesting.",
          "Good museum. Easy to spend a couple hours.",
          "It's a nice museum with interesting facts, but DO NOT PAY FOR THE PAID GUIDED TOURS! \nVery disappointed that they charged me 50 krones extra to the entrance fee for the Viking tour while other people just started following the guide and \u2026",
          "Has a good section on the vikings but the Genghis Khan exhibition was fantastic. Immersive and interactive exhibit with plenty to see and do. Other museums could learn from this.",
          "A very interesting place. Highly recommend for children. It is informative and kids enjoy it. It has a lot of different areas which it covers and the artifacts are well kept. I am so glad that my kids enjoyed it throughly and their excitement will last for long.",
          "Absolutely huge museum covering every aspect of Danish and European history and prehistory, even expanding to some Egyptian and near-Eastern expositions. It will take you at least a few hours and at most multiple days if you want to read every note and explanation",
          "After going through part of the museum as it is vast I wondered whether there is something that they didn't manage to stuff in their collections. A number of themed visits could be the way to see it, just going around hall after hall is too exhausting. Specially liked the most recent years gallery on the upper floor",
          "Great overview of the history of Denmark from the stone age to now. My son thought it could be more interactive, but he liked the section showing life after WWII. I personally liked the temporary exhibition about viking and how they might have looked.",
          "Very interesting museum in the heart of Copenhagen. Learned a lot about Danish history and saw some amazing artifacts.",
          "The museum itself was great - they had a nice Viking exhibit going, and the regular collection was great.  There was no AC though, and it was uncomfortably stuffy and warm throughout the building.  Not sure if it was out of order, or if they don't have one - but it definitely put a damper on what should've been a great outing.",
          "Great collection of items from the earliest years of history of humankind and very well explained in both Danish and English. I was disappointed with the Viking section though. Yet the temporary exhibition of \"Ghengiz Khan\" was absolutely fantastic. I was amazed!",
          "Facinating museum full of lots of history.",
          "Began a two-week tour of the Baltic here. Their viking exhibit made any in the future redundant and pale in comparison. The depth of artifacts and the manner in which they are interpreted are top notch.\nThe Mongol installation was extremely \u2026",
          "Cool Japanese photo booths",
          "Prehistory section is the best I've seen in any large museum. Wonderful.",
          "Really interesting collection of the Iron Age, Viking Age collection could be bigger but it's worth it",
          "Interesting place to visit and see history of Denmark from the beginning. \nBut, some parts are not structured enough Aldo there are a lot of small the same detail shown (I suppose it could be better to dhow just a few, but not all the same).",
          "this museum is a surprise in the amount of items in it. It has about 100 rooms of exquisite displays and things to look at. It covers a great deal of time from Neanderthal man to the 1800s and is a must see if you have the time.",
          "Very large museum with excellent displays. You could easily spend a good few hours here.",
          "It was a great museum although we couldn't visit every section in the 2.5 hours we had. We took one of the free tours, which was absolutely superb and the tour guide went through the sections like a story - quite engaging!",
          "Very pleasant staff.  Children's museum was rather disappointing and the cafe was shut just when we needed a drink at the end of our visit around 15:00.",
          "Informative and huge. The main exhibition is very extensive, and takes forever to go through, so if you are in Copenhagen for a shorter period of time, you should come here in the morning if you wanna make it. Too bad that it closes so early, which makes you go through it really fast if you go there in the afternoon.",
          "A lot of material, particularly from the Viking era, with good explanations in English. The lack of material about WW2 is a pity. There is supposed to be a Resistance Museum elsewhere in Copenhagen but it is closed until 2020.",
          "Really cool museum of Danish history. Multiple levels that trace through the history of Denmark from the earliest known historical precursors to much more recent history. Definitely plenty to check out and it\u2019s well worth the admission fee.",
          "This is a lovely museum with very well done displays and information about the history of Danish people. There is so much to see, you'll want to make sure to give yourself plenty of time to enjoy it all.",
          "Loved the viking exhibits - make sure to check out the longship.",
          "Take a few hours to fully visit everything. Interesting to explore the history.",
          "Nicely set up.  The layout walks you through ancient to near modern times.  The museum is easy to enter, plenty of bathrooms and elevators.  There is a cafe inside and people are invited to hang out.  Recommend going inside and checking it out.",
          "The Gengis Khan exhibit is wonderful.  Must watch the 2 films. The Viking exhibit was also an interesting way to portray them. Unfortunately didn't  have time to explore much else.",
          "Really full of interesting exhibits - very varied and international - such as ghengis khan to toys to the bronze age to the Sami. It is hard to navigate and I got lost on the same floor several times... it goes into great detail so to do \u2026",
          "Definitely worth visiting, huge collection and    might take a while to see the entire place",

          "Worth a visit, the viking stuff is pretty cool.",
          "The museum is beautiful and extra large. Unfortunately, exhibition about Genghis Khan was a little small and disappointing. Too many \"talking heads\". Another dissappointment is the children's part of the museum that has not been changed for years already",
          "I had a lot of fun here. Honestly for the price of admission your get an amazing bang for your money! I didn\u2019t get the chance to view the whole museum because at some point I got lost \ud83d\ude02 but I had an amazing experience of what I did get to see.",
          "Great experience and really good biking exhibition",
          "Good museum, although it was as if all the effort was put into the exhibits on the ground floor. The further upstairs you go the less it feels like they were interested. Plus there is only a small section on the Vikings but it's been well done.",
          "Great for children. I\u2019ve never been to a museum where they were so relaxed with children touching and roaming on their own. \u2764\ufe0f",
          "The first few levels were pretty good. The other levels seemed to filled with random things just to fill the space. A little awkward.",
          "As first time visitors, we found the museum layout to be confusing and poorly signed. Also, oddly for such an important institution, the toilet facilities and availability were very inadequate. On the other hand, the artifacts themselves \u2026",
          "Another stop on the grand tour of Copenhagen! A muse see museum with multiple floors of history and a nice kids area.",
          "Great museum\nParticularly enjoyed the Viking section the Mongol section and the treasures on the 2nd floor. Even if tired worth getting there!\nTook us 3 hours to view 90%.",
          "Very well done and highly informative on the history of Denmark. Rich set of artifacts and exhibits. Allow at least 3-4 hours if you want to cover the key sections and do justice.",
          "Great museum! It takes quite a long time to visit it all. I didn't and still took around 2h. There's a lot to see!",
          "The national museum is the home of some of the the best exhibitions in the kingdom of Denmark. They change the exhibitions, so you are not guaranteed to have the same experience as we had, but we have been there 10+ times and have never \u2026",
          "Really well done museum. I found the most interesting things we're on Floor 2 -- the more modern Danish history. Floor 0 has a popular Viking exhibit that is popular now (very crowded.) The upper floors have few attendees. This museum has a \u2026",

          "Huge Museum and the entrance fee is cheap, we lost about three hours in here and didn\u2019t see it all, it\u2019s stuffed with local (danish) and international history and artefacts.\n\nIt\u2019s not hugely interactive so I would say not massively \u2026",
          "An impressive collection of artifacts, and there are kid-centric activities available.  There was a very well curated Mongolian exhibit when we visited, along with a spooky, haunted-house-ish exhibit (Danish folklore I'm guessing) A general \u2026",
          "Incredibly huge variety of exhibitions, ranging from the history of Denmark to the history of vikings , toys , Egyptian pottery  and the conquests of Genhis Khan. Admission of 95 dkk is rather steep but well worth it, you can spend hours in it.",
          "Amazing place. Great pieces that help us understand the beddings of mankind and how they thought in the past.",
          "great for kids families and history buffs",
          "Wow! Totally worth visiting. A great tours, for example \"meet the vikings\", which cost 50 krons and worth every penny. The best one is \"we will survive\" wich is a free entree for ander 18 years old and in my opinion is the best one.",

          "Its one of the most detailed Museum I've ever been. You get a well rounded idea of life from even before bronze age till now . Of course priorities Danish history as a whole but you can also find artifacts from other places of the world such as the Mediterranean .A must if you travel for knowledge of history",

          "Fantastic museum with so much on offer to see. Charting all the coursebook Danish history. Brilliant exhibition on show here. Need to allow plenty of time though if visiting.

There's also different sections for art for different time periods. There's a mummy section too. Great for families or if you're just visiting.",

          "They had a piece of real Berlin wall!",
          "Very large and diverse collection.  Assume you're going to need a couple of days to do everything. If you're in Copenhagen for a while, consider buying an annual membership. It is the cost of 3 admissions and you can always bring a companion with you.",

          "A must-see for history/art buff. It is an overwhelming museum by its sheer size and the number of shown artifacts. You can easily spend a day there. For a typical tourist, I would recommend following Rick Steves' guidebook. It is super \u2026",

          "Nothing in this museum makes sense. Nothing is displays chronologicly in any way, random items are put at random places. There is almost no english explanations anywhere, except for the occasional sign that says \"pot\" or \"knife\" after a whole page of danish text. Personnel sucks as well.",
          "The museum is just huge! You can spend many hours here because there is a lot on display. Entry price was a bit on the expensive side I think, but the big expositions make up for that. Parts of the museum are very new and modern, however \u2026",

          "Fast, quality for 30mins to many hours",

          "Quality of exhibition varies from era to era but generally it's chaotic and it's a maze to navigate with no clear guidance as where to go in order to follow the timeline or narrative.",

          "Highly recommended if you're a history/museum fan! I could have easily spent all day here.",
          "Not very amusing for an adolescent or teenager, but it wasnt that bad",
          "Well I loved it, not sure if they change or how often their exhibition but I fell in love with the current one. As they advertising 20'000 years of history in front of your eyes from the very beginning through all ages - obviously even a \u2026",
          "Was recommended to go here and it was certainly worth it. There's a lot of good early history and it makes a big change for an Englishman to see the Vikings presented as anything other than brutal raiders - learned a lot about their trading \u2026",
          "Have spent a whole day there, and would go again. Best option for travelers when the weather isn't that great.",

          "What a fun museum, very informative. However, it's not attractive at Carlsberg Museum. Definitely see this one first and try not to spend more than 1:30 hours in there then head to the Glyptotek. Get lost in every room.",
          "The museum is much larger than it looks from the entry hall, you could easily spend a day here; in fact, if you were to look at every point of interest in the museum, you probably would be at the museum the whole day. The museum is spacious \u2026",
          "You should not visit if you don't have at least 3 hours to spare and you should take a tour.",
          "Very nice museum with great exhibits spanning various eras.  Interactive components are sprinkled through the meusum to keep children engaged.  Some notable exhibits include a real Viking ship, and some old medieval-esque hallways with exhibits.  Overall definitely recommend.",

So we didn't see everything.\nIf you want to go there, go only in the first part of the day. At 5pm they close.",
          "A lovely building with a comprehensive collection of national items. Also there guilded tour come with difference theme to facilitate difference audiences.",
          "Probably the best cultural-history museum in the world! P.s: nice cakes for kids and also for adults",

          "Amazing collection to see.  I could spend the day here reading and looking at the collection.\n\nThe place was not too busy today.  They let you enter and leave for a break and re-enter with a day pass.",
          "Great on a wet day. Lunch was excellent!",
          "Very well designed muesum with historical artifacts from all over the world from a variety of time periods. Definitely worth spending at least a few hours there. Start at the top floor and work your way down. They let you take photos at will which is a huge plus for me",
          "The National museum of Denmark is my favorite museum!!! \nAlthough there's no audio guide, the English explanation is more than enough (not only about the exhibition itself but the historical and anthropological meaning behind it)\n-- and \u2026",
          "You could spend 5 hours or more here. I particularly liked the section on Danmark that was about it's slaving activities, I never knew! Danmark through the ages is also a nice display.",

          "Great National museum. We like meet the Vikings exhibit.",
          "So. Much. History. We went here only budgeting 90 minutes and barely skimmed the surface of items to see. The organization of the museum was impressive as well. Very quick moving and orderly. ",
          "Basal knowledge",
          "Great museum, I really enjoyed their ancient human exhibition. It is laid out so you can see the evolution of society, blew my mind! One of the best museum gift shops too",
          "Fascinating, so much to see that we couldn't  cover it in one visit. We will be back!",

          "Very big museum with lots of details but it doesn't have a possibility of audio guide.",
          "A nice museum but generally poorly designed exhibits. There are films projected on the walls of sunlit rooms - at least the presence of a projector and audio suggested that. One of the maps is helpfully displayed in four undistinguished \u2026",

          "I love this museum. The admission is fee admission and have a great layout!\nYou visit the museum naturally in a chronological manner.\nThere's some temporary exhibit that worth the visit too. \nThey have a nice restaurant. Probably you going to spend a day over there.",
          "Love this setting. Antiquities exhibition was amazing",
          "Very rich collection, all antique have English descriptions which is really nice. But the A/C is not functioning well. And I was expecting more on the Viking age period.",
          "They have a floor dedicated to Denish history, 1660-2000. Thats what I found most interesting. The floor dedicated to south america and asian countries is nothing special.",
          "Well-curated temporary exhibitions",
          "Really cool museum that takes you from the start of civilization through the modern era. I'm not usually a huge fan of museums but the plethora of ancient artifacts kept me enthralled for hours.  You can easily spend an entire day here",

        "wiki": "National Aquarium Denmark, Den Bl\u00e5 Planet (Danish: Den Bl\u00e5 Planet, Danmarks Akvarium) is a public aquarium in Denmark. The original aquarium was located in Charlottenlund, but this facility closed in 2012 and most of the animal collection was relocated to the new and much larger aquarium Den Bl\u00e5 Planet (lit.: The Blue Planet) in Kastrup, a suburb of Copenhagen. The National Aquarium Denmark, Den Bl\u00e5 Planet opened to the public in March 2013 and is the largest aquarium in Northern Europe.\nThe main purpose of the aquarium is to disseminate marine information, help science projects, and help improve educational institutions.\n\n\n== The former aquarium ==\nDenmark's Aquarium in Charlottenlund started construction in 1937 and was opened in 1939. In 1974, this aquarium was expanded to feature five large landscape aquaria and a biological museum with theme-based exhibits and aquariums. In 1990, the facility was further expanded by a new front hall, caf\u00e9, improved toilet facilities and a schooler service. In the final years before the closure of the aquarium in Charlottenlund, it had about 1,000,000 litres (220,000 imp gal; 260,000 US gal) of water in about 70 aquarium tanks.\n\n\n== Current aquarium ==\nDen Bl\u00e5 Planet opened in 2013 in Kastrup, a suburb of Copenhagen. It resembles a whirlpool when seen from above. It often is, being close to the Copenhagen Airport. It was designed by Danish architects 3XN. To reduce energy consumption the building is equipped with cooling units using seawater from \u00d8resund and double glazing. It covers a total of 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft), including the 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) building and 2,000 m2 (22,000 sq ft) outdoors (excluding parking spaces).In the first year of existence, the aquarium received approximately 1.3 million visitors \u2013 twice as many as expected. To mitigate this extra wear, and in order to improve public education, 12.5 million DKK (approx. 2.3 million US$; 1.7 million \u20ac) were  spent on changes and renovations of the aquarium.The Blue Planet contains about 7,000,000 litres (1,500,000 imp gal; 1,800,000 US gal) of water divided into 53 exhibits. There are five main sections:\nThe Rainforest\nThe rainforest section is home to dwarf and Philippine crocodiles, arowanas, pacus, freshwater stingrays, large catfish, boa constrictors, violet turaco and more. This section also has an aquarium with a big school\u2013about 3,000\u2013of piranhas. Near the rainforest is the smaller grotto section, with aquaria for cave tetra, various electric fish (electric eel and elephantfish) and other fish found in dark freshwater habitats.\nThe African Great Lakes\nExhibits for Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria. Primarily aimed at cichlids, but also home to other fish such as Nile perch (highly predatory and therefore separated from the Victoria cichlids by acrylic glass), and the section above the aquaria are home to village weaver birds, and other small animals.Evolution and adaption\nAimed at fish evolution and adaption, and contains a mangrove aquarium with four-eyed fish, archerfish, mudskippers and alike, as well as aquaria for Apalachicola snapping turtle and primitive fish such as bichir, gar and lungfish. This includes the oldest fish in the aquarium, an Australian lungfish that arrived at Denmark's Aquarium in Charlottenlund in 1967 when already a young adult (its full age is unknown).Cold Water\nPrimarily home to native Danish species from fresh- and saltwater. Among others, it includes a touch pool, and a large North Atlantic aquarium with a 15 m (49 ft) tall seabird cliff, which is home to cod, wolffish, conger, puffin and other species. Non-native species in or near the Cold Water section are giant Pacific octopus, sea anemones and more. This section also housed California sea lions for a period (their previous home, Bergen Aquarium in Norway was being renovated). In early 2014 they were moved to a permanent home at La Palmyre Zoo, France. Following modifications, a pair of sea otters moved into the former sea lion exhibit in October 2014, making the aquarium one of only three places where this species can be seen Europe (the others being Lisbon Oceanarium, Portugal and Oceanopolis in Brest, France.)\nThe Warm Ocean\nThis section contains the largest aquarium in Blue Planet, the 4,000,000-litre (880,000 imp gal; 1,100,000 US gal) Ocean tank. It is home to sharks (zebra shark, blacktip reef shark, wobbegongs and young scalloped hammerheads), stingrays, eagle rays, guitarfish, moray eels, golden trevallies, groupers and more that can be seen through the 16 by 8 m (52 by 26 ft) main window, which is 45 cm (18 in) thick. There is also a 16 m (52 ft) long shark tunnel. Opposite the Ocean Tank is the 16 m (52 ft) long coral reef with living corals and reef fish. There are also various smaller aquaria with species such as shrimpfish, weedy seadragon, seahorses, a Mediterranean aquarium, and the highly venomous stonefish, lionfish and olive sea snake.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Den Bl\u00e5 Planet at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\n(in Danish) Denmark Zoo Central",

          "The place is very beautiful and I am sure the experience is totally a different one if you visit when it's not totally crowded. So if you are a tourist, the most friendly advice: don't go during the weekend. Secondly, pay attention if you plan to use the lockers: it cost you 1",
          "We stopped off here the afternoon before our flight home. There was something so charming about this Aquarium, it was one of my highlights during my trip to Copenhagen. I have never seen sea otters before to my knowledge and they were having fun. Second only to the biggest",

          "I can compare this aquarium to many others, and it's really a well maintained one with many exhibits. At the same time, it doesn't have anything special, one or two things to remember, to let it stand out. It could be a good idea to visit this attraction, especially if you come",

          "This wasn\u2019t the largest aquarium I\u2019d ever been to but was really good. The staff were friendly and helpful and even did their talks in both danish and English. Watching the sea otters being fed and playing was fun, but for me watching the large tank with the sharks and rays was",
          "I am big aquarium enthusiast. If I hear of an aquarium in a town that I am traveling to I will go out of my way to visit it just because I dig seeing beautiful underwater animals in their element. The Blue Planet National Aquarium of Denmark is not the biggest or best aquarium",
          "Great to go before the airport as there\u2019s a free shuttle bus and big lockers. Could stay all day on the beanbags watching the main tank. The otters were very cute and lots of interactive things. There\u2019s deckchairs and kids play area outside. Cafe tasty and ok price.",
          "Far smaller than I had hoped/was led to believe from guidebooks & the Internet. The building is beautiful & designed to look like a whooshing wave. The Amazon Rainforest Exhibit was great - both above & below the waterline. I was thrilled to see arapaima swimming around,",
          "Not so good. I was expecting something better, and bigger. No big fish like sharks,except 2-3. If it\u2019s your first time in aquarium is ok. If you have been in other, don\u2019t go.",
          "A beautiful aquarium with a variety of sea life. There is a interactive area where you can touch the fish and starfish. Very popular with family with kid. Expect lots of noises. Quite a walking distance from the closest train station. Tips: included in Copenhagen Card 72 hours",
          "10 minutes ago The aquarium itself is beautiful. Still I'm concerned about the animals' health. People are constantly taking pictures with flash. Visitors (mostly parents with children) are loud as hell, making the fish uncomfortable and very very stressed. They're constantly",
          "It was the last thing visited by me in Copenhagen, on the way to the airport, which is very close. Much smaller than I expected, in just a little over an hour I had seen everything. To this sensation contributed probably the fact that \u201cThe rainforest\u201d section was closed for",
          "This is a great indoor activity when it\u2019s raining outside, but it\u2019s a decent trek from the city center. It takes about an hour to go though the entire thing. The sea otters were active and the underground shark tunnel was cool - but much shorter than I was expecting. There were",
          "We visited again and though we were gutted that the Amazon/rain forest area was closed it was still a brilliant place to visit Also want to give a thankyou to the shop assistant in the gift shop, he was brilliant, we went to leave and he said about the animal coming out",
          "The overall experience of the place, is that it is an impressive place. They have several good lectures and guided tours. My but, goes on to several of their aquariums, where it seems as if there is too little space for the animals.",
          "This is one of the must-see attractions in Copenhagen. We didn't pay an entrance fee because we had a Copenhagen Card, and the line wasn't long either, even if it was a saturday. The fish are beautiful. My favorite part was the tunnel that went under the aquarium with the big",
          "Just to preface, if you need to go to the airport and not sure what to do with your luggage theres storage lockers here for suitcases and bags so you can go straight to the airport. I found this aquarium really small, as you walk it is separated into 3 sections. sections 2 and",
          "The aquarium has some fantastic exhibits such as the tank full of piranhas, the shark tunnel, and the sea birds exhibit (where you can watch the birds swim underwater). To get to the aquarium, take the M2 train and get off the Kastrup Station. You can then walk east for 10",
          "the aquarium \"blue planet\" offers a great seletion of species, including a relatively large tank wich features sharks. it is located in the vecinity of Copenhagen Airport and travellers may want to use their time in transit to visit the place. it is certainly worth a visit.",
          "Went here just to look around and because it was a nice walk from the hotel. The aquarium is well thought out and has a lot of educational pieces that take more than one visit to take it all in--if you read every thing. The large tank with the sharks, rays, etc., is amazing",
          "Great experience! So well laid out and presented and so well run! Excellent information boards in three languages (including English). Lockers to leave your luggage. Good cafe etc. Highlights - fish which nibble the skin from your hands, touching rays in a big open pool, seeing",
          "Cool aquarium with some interesting attractions like the sea otters. The location next to the sea is great and the building beautiful. Nothing special though... it wouldn't be a highly recommended attraction in Copenhagen for me as it is quite small and expensive for what it is.",
          "This will take your breath away. The size of the main tank is amazing. It looks like the size of an Imax screen. All wellaid out. And the otters are really good to watch. Easy to get to by the very accessible Metro.",
          "Beautifully designed aquarium with lots of varied viewing set ups. Many different \u201cenvironments\u201d all full of marine life. There also seemed to be lots of active and hands on areas for kids- school groups and families. It\u2019s closer to the airport than the city center so only go",
          "Not the biggest aquarium which I quickly learned with 9 hours to still krill before my flight! But enjoyed it nether-less, the shows were informative and in English and danish",
          "The Danish have extraordinary skill and talent for presentation - any museum will confirm that - but this modern aquarium is a prime example of marrying architecture, content, accessibility and experience. Size appropriate for the city, the displays are diverse, beautifully",
          "Visited on a sunny day with a 9 year old and a 16 months old - both were greatly entertained (and I learned a little as well ;) ) expensive and heard from others that it can be crowded on a rainy day, but in total a great experience.",
          "Lots of fish to look at. Some kids were moaning that they couldn't find Nemo, but they obviously didn't look too hard as I found him without any trouble. Worth a visit if you like fish. Not so much if you don't.",
          "The aquarium is located a short walk from the new driver less Metro. You can bring a picnic and there is an outdoor playground for smaller children. The fish were obviously the main attraction and there is loads to see and touch. A great place to visit.",
          "We decided to visit the aquarium during our few days in Copenhagen as it looked interesting and took us to a different part of the city. Entry was included in our Copenhagen cards and it was easy to get to using the M2 metro line with about a 10 minute walk to the Aquarium",
          "Yes, it has fish in tanks, touch pools, ecological explanarions, a big glass tunnel through one of the tanks - all the things you expect. But it's also in a very cool curvy star-shaped building on the harbour which really works well to make it a good experience. And it has",
          "This is a fairly new building made for the purpose, and therefore well suited to modern ways of exhibisions. Divided in different areas and with good descriptions. We were there on a rainy day, and it was a bit crowded.",
          "Great family outing when visiting Copenhagen. Easy to reach from the city on the M2 Metro line with a short walk from the Kalstrup Station. We used our Copenhagen (tourist) Card to cover the entry fees for two adults and two children, so was good value (would have cost around",
          "Beautiful, a nice aquarium, outstanding for little ones, it's Interactive, there a little play diving boot, you can pet seastars, there is a beautiful playground .. we've had 2 hours full of fun! Even our little one of 8 months loved to watch the Fishes.",
          "Spent more than 3hours in Aquarium with my teenage daughter, seen all the exhibitions, huge aquariums, touch pools, watched the training and feeding of sea otters - no suppression, only positive approach. The territory is rather big, with nice open air patio and play ground for",
          "Beautiful aquarium with different things to do rather than just look at fish to keep the kids entertained. They have a kids play submarine inside and an underground little cave for them to crawl into and look up at fish also little games along the walls to play with and a lovely",
          "Aquarium is just amazing, a lot of different animals, divided in three sections. They offer a lot of activities for children. There is also a terace with great see view.",
          "Probably the best place to observe the life of the animals in both ocrans, rivers and tropical climate. It deserves the money. You will be able to see and touch different animals that live in water, divided in 3 regions. The space is preety big and there are many surprises on",
          "This Aquarium is well worth a visit! Loads if interactive things for all to do including \"Doctor Fish\" - Loads of talks and a playground! Lockers also available to store all your bags which was great!",
          "Pretty, but somewhat limited for what you pay. We made the mistake of coming during the school holidays, but despite tge crowds it didn't take us very long to see everything there was to see.",
          "Disappointing. I did not see anything special in this aquarium, and it was quite small compared to the other European ones. The place is quite family friendly though.",
          "From the minute you approach this building you are drawn in by the architecture. It is well designed to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. There are three main sections to it and the talks are really good. The kids can get involved in feeding some of the fish, and",
          "We visited the aquarium using our Copenhagen Card on the final day of our trip after dropping our luggage off at the airport. It\u2019s easy to access by public transport, just 10 minutes from the metro station and about five minutes from a bus stop. The aquarium was very hands on",
          "Blue Planet is one of the main attractions in Copenhagen. It\u2019s a good day out for all. Everything in the way of fish and sea life here. Even Sea Otters. Pricey souvenir shop. Easy to get to using the Metro. It\u2019s a short walk from the station, but is well signposted. Hop on, Hop",
          "The fish and wildlife are beautiful and amazing, totally worth seeing! As a tropics lover I adored the second wing with the rainforest part, piranha and etc. Also very important to mention that it was the first aquarium, where we saw a nice exhibition of European waterlife, fish",
          "The Blue Planet is a very beautiful aquarium with many fascinating fishes and sea creatures - we especially liked the big ocean aquarium where sharks are swimming close pass you. With every aquarium there is an interactive display with useful information about each of the",
          "I've been to lots of aquariums and this was the best. You can walk around yourself and sitting on beanbags gazing at the huge fish tank was amazing. Top floor water play area was a hit too.",
          "So glad went to the Aquarium ( not something we would do in a city break). Loved the setting loved the exhibits and the big tank with the tunnel was lovely. Great place to spend a few hours and is suitable to all ages.",
          "Really enjoyed it. Was looking to a time filler due to flight cancellations and getting an extra day on a low budget. Could stroke the fish and star fish and the shark tank was fantastic Went 4pm and was out by half 5 spent most of the time with the sea otters (who love to put",
          "This was included in our Copenhagen card, and what a great couple of hours we had. We got there early and managed to beat the queues, when we were leaving the queue was huge! The aquarium has different sections, including sea lions outside which happened to be feeding time when",
          "I came here with my friend & her 2 little ones. The kids (both under 5) loved it, great outdoor area too for when the weather is dry, lots to see & do, very interesting.",
          "It was a nice aquarium to visit. We loved viewing the different areas. It would be a great place for littles. They had a wonderful outdoor play area and the kids seem to love it",
          "Whenever there's an aquarium in a city we're visiting, we just go to see it. So we've seen quite a lot of them, the past decades. And maybe they're not always very modern or large, they never fall to impress. But a few of them deserve some extra praise. Like this fairly new one",
          "My family and I spent delightful hours in the aquarium. The aquarium has many areas for children to interact with sea animals and touching the stingrays was the highlight of their day. The kids had lots of fun playing outside with all the water toys. Highly recommend.",
          "The design is a strong reason for the success. A drawback is that many of the (plexi)glass is difficult to see through murky waters. If they could solve those viewing issues it would greatly improve experience.",
          "Took the family here on a warm sunny day and ended up spending most of it in the play area where there is a lot of water-based toys for kids to play with. Ideal when it\u2019s hot. There is also a lot of different displays inside and a stand where kids can get up close to small fish",
          "It's a nice experiance, but it's nothing special. There aren't so many things to see and it takes a lot to come there. Around 45 minutes from the city centre. And the price is not so popular.",
          "We've visited a wide range of aquariums from Osaka in Japan to Monterey on the west coast of the US. 10 years ago the Danish aquarium was in the dark ages in an old building north of the city, but with their move to this absolutely amazing new building right by the sirport",
          "I loved my recent visit to Den Bla Planet. There were many hands-on activities for children but it was also very impressive and fun for adults. There were also live informational \"exhibits\" involving the sea otters, oceanic fish, and even a mermaid meet & greet in the rainforest",
          "This place is a good choice for families with kids especially if weather is bad outside. We liked it. Kids were impressed that it was allowed to touch some fish, crabs and starfish! It to approximately 3 hours to walk around, read some info in interactive screens. We could spend",
          "Worthwhile for kids. The sections are quite informative. I was wondering about the amount of resources required to maintain the Amazon rainforest. Watching the sea otters feed is pleasant. There is aplenty outdoor space for kids and adults and if the weather permits, one can",
          "Spent part of a day at the aquarium with the family while on vacation. We all enjoyed our time there wandering through the different displays of fish, sea creatures and more. The aquarium is a bit outside central Copenhagen - one stop from the airport at Kastrup. Still, it is",
          "I'm not sure if I should rate this as average or a bit higher. This was my 2nd trip to Copenhagen this time with my family. One of the things we were interested in doing was the National Aquarium even before we arrived in Denmark. So we got the Copenhagen card and figured use it",
          "We have enjoyed the visit a lot. If you travel with kids there are couple of interactive places where we found most interesting the one where kids can touch and \u201cplay\u201d with fish and other animals from local waters. Of course the big aquariums with mantas, turtles or sharks or",
          "I was really expecting something razzle-dazzle given the stats I read about the Aquarium and it's cool architectual design seen in aerial photos. And, the aerial photos are about the only way you get a sense of the design as it's not clearly apparent when you approach the",
          "The design of this building is starnge but when you comes inside you felt it is much bigger as it is. The museum has a active places for kids to understand the sea",
          "One of the nicer aquariums I\u2019ve visited. The coral reef exhibit is gorgeous! The cafe inside has delicious food and the view from the table is spectacular. Very nice afternoon!",
          "Den Bla is an aquarium and a very well designed one at that. It flows very nicely. It has a lot of activities and ways to keep kids occupied. I visited alone and managed to walk around in around half an hour and then moved on, however I didn't have a lot of time. Very",
          "My daughter likes sharks. This place is well worth a trip an you can probably spend a full day here absorbing all the knowledge available, studying all the animals, caressing the starfishes, aweing at the corals, taking selfies with the sharks and high-fiveing the giant otters.",
          "This was my first aquarium so I may not be objective, but it is really nice and woderful place to spend time with the kids. Each hours they have spacial events in which you can take part. Also they have place were you can touch the sea inhabitants. As for me the most interesting",
          "We went to this aquarium on a Monday. There were lots of students on school outings. If you have a Copenhagen card one can use it here. It is a large facility near the airport. One can take the train going to the airport. It's a great place as its. Well designed and",
          "This is a great aquarium to visit, there is so much to see. There were very cute Otters, Sharks, seahorses etc. There's a rain forrest with frogs, birds and Piranah fish. There is a shop and a cafe, or you can take a packed lunch and sit and eat while watching the Sharks and",
          "We had full use of the Copenhagen card. So easy, gained access to the aquarium. So worth spending about 2 hours here. Beautiful tanks, utterly breath taking tank with hammer heads and a sea turtle. Lady did a talk about a feed there in danish and English - couldn\u2019t fault her!",
          "The aquarium was included in the Copenhagen card which was good as I don\u2019t think think would be worth the entrance fee. The inside is very nice and it looked new and clean. Some of the enclosures could of been bigger and the sea otters looked quite stressed being cooped up in",

          "We visited on a Monday when open until 9pm. We used the CPH card to get in and for transport from the centre to here. Small walk from the train station and sign posted. The displays are good and informative and lots in English. There is a gigantic tank containing fish and sharks",
          "The Blue Planet is the Danish national aquarium. It is quite new, inaugurated in 2013... The aquarium is divided into three main sections, each being quite self-contained. The sea otters in an outside pool are fun to watch , especially during feeding time. There are regular",
          "We only came here as its included with the Copenhagen card. If you love fish in aquariums then you'll love it. There were plenty of talks and feeding going on. The sea otters were my highlight. Watching them at feeding time was great. You can tell they are well looked after by",
          "Loved our visit here. Got the train from central Copenhagen and it\u2019s a short walk from the station to the aquarium. The entry fee was covered on our Copenhagen card and the visit took about 3-4 hours. Highlights were the bats and poisonous tree frogs alongside all fish. The",
          "We arrived around 2:30 and found we had enough time to get around the aquarium by closing time at 5. There\u2019s 3 main sections attached to a central hub so it\u2019s quite easy to choose the sections in any order or easily make your way from a numbered attraction in one section to",
          "The aquarium is on the outskirts of the city, but easily reached by metro train. The aquarium is in a striking new building and consists of three main areas and around 50 tanks. Good interpretation. The highlight is the ocean reef tank with sharks and rays. A good tunnel takes",
          "We took the Train from Central station to the airport (3 stops) and then the Metro (1 stop) to Den Bla Planet which was so easy. We spent the whole morning just wandering round and then watched the Sharks being fed..interactive articles for children & adults to try too...",
          "This was a worthwhile visit for me. I live in California, where we have two fine aquariums, and I\u2019ve also visited The Maui Ocean Center in Hawaii.

          "The Aquarium is 10 minutes away from Kastrup metro station. Although the crowd is generally mixed, children seem to be in majority. The Aquarium is divided into 3 sections, Coral Reef, Ocean, and River. All these three water regions have been very well represented. Beside each",
          "If you have a Copenhagen card this attraction is free. We went after 10 am and it was extremely busy and loud inside. I was also a bit dissappointed in the size of the aquarium. The sea otters were lovely.",
          "From the outside, this aquarium looks HUGE!! The building is magnificent and futuristic. Once you enter though you realise it is a lot smaller than it looks. The cafe takes up half of the building. There are only 3 areas to the aquarium. However I still recommend visiting,",
          "Visited here on a rainy day when travelling back to the airport. Easy to get to via public transport. Lots to see there and spent ages just sat watching the rays and sharks in the big tank. Big plus point - lockers big enough to put a large suitcase. Had to pay 10DKK but didn\u2019t",
          "I have visited better aquariums then this one, was very disappointed in the size of it. The aquarium's they have are nice but not many spectacular fishes. We went there to see the shark's getting fed and get some information about them, the lady giving the presentation was",
          "We visited on a cold and rainy day! Great day to see the aquarium. To be honest I was expecting a larger establishment, but being Australian I think we are already used to very big aquariums as standard. This one was no bigger than the one in Sydney. The displays were beautiful",
          "So much to see and so easy to see everything, a must to visit. The viewing is amazing, watchinv hammerhead sharks swim by you as you stand just inches away from them.",
          "Really interesting aquarium. There is a huge indoor tank that includes rays, hammerhead sharks and even a turtle, but in addition there is an area that showcases local fish and animals (cod, otters, puffins etc) and an exciting rainforest area too. Exhibits all have information",
          "This aquarium knows three important parts: \"The rainforest, the barrier reef and the Norethern seas\". The Great Barrier Reef, The rivers (under and above the surface) of therainforest; and the big tank with the sharks are top of the bill. You see a lot of species and special",

          "You can tell the animals are well cared for here. They all have huge areas to swim about and looks as natural as it can be. Plenty of things to do and see such as kids able to pick up starfish and crabs. Staff friendly. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited this awuarium on a rainy monday and it was a very pleasant visit. The negative sides of the visit was that the booking.com attraction discount was not accepted there nor they didn't have any student discounts for internarional students. It is locared quite far from",
          "This a lovely aquarium and, as most places in Denmark are, really geared up for kids of all ages. We went last week with our daughter and her three children 5, 3 and 5 months who live in Copenhagen. The kids love it so much we bought them an annual family pass which pays for",
          "This is a good experience. If you like fish, sea, lake and the like!!! Be sure to visit the local Nordic/Danish areas, could be a little more interesting than The reefs +++ Use a couple of hours. We also took the tour behind the scenes. Very interesting for sure.",
          "This was a nice experience. The architecture from the outside is also beautiful. The inside is split into 3-4 sections including outdoor exhibits and the rain forest. The \u2018zoo keeper\u2019 had a short presentation during feeding time in the main aquarium which housed a bunch of",
          "Definitely worth a visit If you are in Copenhagen and are interested in wildlife in general. Interesting amount of different creatures to look at and watch. The shark room was by far my favourite part of the aquarium as you can sit down and just watch the sharks and other fish",
          "I've been here in a rainy January day and I didn't regret it. It was included in the copenaghen card so, why not? The place is not that big but it's very interesting and well organized with lots of information and activities for kids. You can also see otters being fed on the",
          "Stunning building and entrance, and good aquarium inside with nice variety. But we expected it would be bigger from the inside and more impressive; we were somehow disappointed. Visit ended in 1.5 hours. If you have visited the one in Barcelona or London, you can skip this one.",
          "Wonderful location close to the sea and many marine life areas to visit. It is really an interesting acquarium, it is worth a visit. It is quite easy to reach it by train. The station is just a few meters away. There is also a wide parking area for those who prefer arriving by",

          "Visited on our last day as it was so near the airport wish we had visited sooner so we could spend more time. Every tank was jaw droppingly brilliant and sooooo big. The shark tunnel is a must, listen to the announcements of the feeding times all are very informative and done",
          "I really liked the layout of Den Bla Planet. It was somewhat difficult to find but only because the street that was the main one leading to it was blocked and the detour was not well directed. There was ample parking. We got there early (about 1030) and it defitneily made a",
          "I have been to various aquariums around the world, but this is by far up there among the best. The variety of fish is good. There is a nice amount of information for every species. It is an impressive aquarium, and even though the price is a bit high, I would say that it is",
          "It is a good aquarium and easy to get to from the orebron. It's very kid friendly and the outdoor section is a must in warm weather with kids. A minor drawback is the fee parking and fee lockers, and a moe significant drawback is the restaraunt. The waitstaff was very slow and",
          "Yesterday I went to the aquarium with my friends. However, I was very disappointed with the false information that was given to us by the staff. We were at the shark tank and watched them getting fed and the staff said if you have any question you can come up and ask. So that is",
          "The aquarium is very nice, BUT the experience was terrible! Its like being in a gigantic kindergarden! There was children running around and shouting all over the place, sad because it could have been a nice experience.",

          "Very interesting and informative. Fantastic aquariums and big oceanic aquarium. If just a little interested in sealife, set off at least a few hours.",
          "If you are a plus size person with backpains, the large areas without seating opportunities may be problematic. The restaurants floor was filthy. But the exhibits in themselves was so good, so beautiful and wonderful I highly HIGHLY recommend it.",
          "We visited here with my fiance. There were many interesting species at show and we got to see the sea otters being fed which was fun. The big tank was also worth seeing. However I do feel like this is more of a family destination and there are many activities that are mainly for",
          "My wife and I went with our 2 year-old daughter, and she was completely all over the place and enjoying herself. It was a great experience, and there was plenty for our daughter to do. Lots of colorful fish, big fish, small fish, sharks, and otters. Fish to touch, and things to",

          "I visited many aquariums, but this is one of the best. We bought the ticket included bus transfer from the Central railway station. It was very useful. We spent 2 hours there. We saw fish feeding show - very interesting. I liked recreated environment for diving birds. You can",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit. A fantastic and very interesting aquarium. Easy rich from the city centre.",
          "Perhaps, one of the most relaxing things you can do is watch fish swim. We travelled on the S train, but buses can get you there, using our combined travel/entrance card, saves time and money. We stopped off at the Funkis caf\u00e9 on the corner after leaving the station, sandwiches",
          "This aquarium is lacking in terms of varieties of species and size if comparing to US aquariums. We had the Copenhagen card so entry fees come with it; otherwise, you may find it a bit expensive for what you're getting (USD 26 for adult and 15 for children). However, if you'd",
          "We didn\u2019t make it for the mermaid show, but the aquarium has a huge floor the ceiling glass that allow the children to be right next to the glass and see the fishes and the sharks! It was a lovely experience, my four years old love it!",

          "I've been to a lot of aquariums around the world and this is easily the best. Definitely not the biggest, but the perfect conditions, the layout, and the shark tunnel make it my favourite. Some of the information labels are incorrect (i.e. not on the correct tank), but that is",
          "It is a nice aquarium but it just filled two hours of our day. We used our Copenhagen Card and that was great - and we didn't have much time to spend there - but it's a good job as it was done in 2 hours. BIt of a let down....",
          "We spent our last day here before flying home and I cannot recommend it enough! Its about 800mt walk from the metro - clearly signposted, very helpful staff on reception. They have lockers for your luggage (10dkk). Everything is clearly signed, with interactive screens in both",
          "One of the better aquariums I've visited. The kids loved it. Especially the huge wall with the sharks and stingrays.",
          "We were waiting for check in in the hotel, so we went here. It's not some must see in Cobenhavn, but if you have some spare time I recomend to go. We really enjoyed our time in, espacially the \"tunel throiught the water\" and sea otters.",
          "This is a fantastic place for all of the family. You can see hammerhead sharks, stingrays and more in the huge tanks. You can touch crabs, small fish and starfish in the small aquariums (under the supervision of incredibly knowledgeable staff). You can witness a (fairly child",
          "This aquarium has been around for some time now, and compared to the old construction in Charlottenlund it has changed to something remarkable. But with advanced public aquariums being established many places it has to be compared to those, and in such a context it is 'just'",

          "When we booked for Copenhagen this was on my to-do lists! It was raining on our first day there, and with this being an indoor activity we didn't mind doing that first - however be prepared to fork out for a taxi or find a way there - it's a bit further out than you'd think.",
          "There is something about an aquarium which always brings a smile and this one is no different. The areas are nicely broken up with signage and explanations in both Danish and English. It here were no seals but a couple otters doing their thing to the enjoyment of the viewers.",
          "Nothing special, sort of the same as other aquariums available in other cities. Still fun to see, and we spent a couple of hours here with the kids. Food was not good here, and would recommend to eat somewhere else. I ordered the sausage and it was so bad, really strange",
          "One of our party wanted to go here and even though it was a subway ride an a few mins walk ( we missed the shuttle) it was worth it! A very well done aquarium! Even had a sandwhich on the patio!",

          "Despite being out of town, getting here was super easy via the metro system. As a solo traveller on a short trip it made the 'must see' short list and didn't disappoint. Very interesting, very tourist friendly and great views and exhibits as well as being topical and up to date.",
          "Really worth the trip; also outside were you can sit an contemplate the passage of ships into the Baltic.",
          "We spent 3 fun hours in the blue planet aquarium and it was so much fun. My 5 and 8 year old mostly loved the freshwater fish (piranhas) and my husband literally spent an hour in front of the ocean tank. The outside playground was also fun. A highlight for the whole family!",
          "Fairly big aquarium with lots of different animals to see. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t enjoy our visit, because it was overrun by visitors. You could barely approach most of the fishtanks and if you managed to get a good view on the fishes you had to soon step aside to make room",

          "This aquarium was great in and out and had many exhibits. We have been to many aquariums before, but being here allowed us to see fish that are not in aquairums here in the states. By far the best part was the huge fish tank! It was massive, i would say at least 20-30 feet",
          "Perfect Place for aquatic experience! This Place is huge and got so many diffrent spieces from Neon tetra to hammer head sharks. This is a must go if youre in kastrup copenhagen. Great value for the money",
          "We came today to the famous blue planet national aquarium. The queue at the entrance moved quickly enough, the entrance ticket a bit expansive. Inside the ocean wing the hammer shark and rays are great to see, alongside other colorful ocean animals. We came to the bistro&cafe",
          "All the exhibits had touch pads in Swedish, Danish, and English, which was good. Also, a good playground. The aquarium is not that large, so a couple of hours should be enough.",
          "This was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours but it doesn't offer great value for money. It will keep the kids entertained for an afternoon but there are better attractions.",
          "In general a fantastic place to visit. It is great to see all the different fishes. But a bit expensive to get in. I am not sure if it is an attraction you must visit when in Copenhagen. There is a restaurant in there, but again a bit expensive. Anyway there's also a place where",
          "The sharks and sea otters were favorites for my kids. The outdoor play areas are also very popular. There are places to eat picnics if you bring your in food. It is not a huge aquarium, which makes it nice to visit in a couple of hours and not be too tiring.",
          "This was probably the top children's attraction we have ever been to. My 6 year old, 3 year old, husband and I just loved it. Immaculate and well laid out. Not too big, just perfect to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "Spent few 2/3 hours here. Quite easy to get to, can catch bus or train to get here. Quite a small aquarium but they\u2019ve got plenty to see whilst you are there. They have different activities through out the day like watching the sharks being fed and seeing the otters interact",
          "I went there with family. I liked it but it didn\u2019t make me say wow. It is little bit expensive. Maybe I will visit one time again.",
          "Its is utter chaos inside, there is a lot to see but dont worry the place isnt that big. Take note, when there is a show on it is chaos if not dangerous the way everyone runs to the designated area. Strollers, prams, kids, adults, just get out of the way.",
          "Went alone with a toddler in a push chair. Everything was fairly well accessible, but had to carry him a few places.

          "Quite a good aquarium, not too big but a nice experience. Recommended if visiting with kids. Otherwise, you won\u2019t spend more than an hour there. The big tank with the tunnel is quite impressive, also - the sea otters are very funny :)",

          "If you come in the morning you have a chance to see everything. All aquariums are done nicely. Lots of attraction especially for kids, for example, they can touch some fish and see sea otters.",
          "We got a taxi from the airport but it is actually really close. We put our bags in the lockers. There was also a coat rack near the toilets. The aquarium is large and includes feeding the stingrays. They put the food on a stick and you see how they eat. Very interesting.",
          "Beautiful well maintained and structured museum. Just the right amount of information, it is a place you have to sit down and enjoy. I was lucky, not too many people and I could really immerse in this beautiful ocean world.",

          "It is very close to the Airport and of course by the sea. Nice area with many kind of section about nature and water. There are also a underwater tunnel when you can observe big fishes. Yes it is expensive like everything in Denmark.",
          "The aquarium is next to the airport. They also have couple sea otters in addition to the fish. Worth the visit especially if you have kids. The most interesting part of the aquarium for the kids was where one can touch and fell the living fish and sea creatures.",

          "amazing architect - building fantastic...aquarium out of this planet and loads to do - really close to the airport so even if you have a transit in Copenhagen it is only 12 minutes WALK - highly recommend Den Bl\u00e5 Planet",
          "Rather close place at the edge near the Bridge on a way to the CPH airport. Fine collection of sea animals, and great presentation of Amazon rain forrest and jungle humidity conditions... Special presentations of feeding the animals. Expected to see maybe some larger animal, but",

          "Visited yesterday to escape the rain. Enjoyed it, very well thought out. The otters are gorgeous, and we spent a good deal of time just chilling watching the shark/ray tank. All the touch screen information for each tank was bilingual, which was very much appreciated and very",
          "We had been mildly warned by our tour guide that the blue planet might not offer what we expected. None of that was the case. The blue planet offers three very interesting tours of wet habitats. The first one centres on the Danish and Northerly oceans, explaining in detail how",
          "We had a fantastic time at the aquarium. All the exhibits were great & very interesting. Our favourite exhibit was the tropical section with the paranas & arapaima fish! We highly recommend checking it out. It's great for adults & children. M. CollectivelyME(dot)net",
          "Although few aquariums can compare to my home town Cape Town Two Oceans Aquarium, I really enjoyed this one. It houses so many different varieties of fish and other sea life - the otters were a highlight for me. Worth the train trip and walk to get there.",
          "An international aquarium of very high quality both for a single visitor and families as well. I especially enjoyed the octopus and the \"big aquarium\" together with beautiful corals - and the food from Meyers Kitchen running the restaurant. Do not miss The Blue Planet in",
          "The Blue Planet is located on the strait between Sweden and Denmark, between Kastrup Airport and the Amager Beach. It is close to the airport Clarion Hotel (formerly the Hilton) and is reachable via an easy bike ride on the way to the beach. If coming from elsewhere, it is an",

          "We took the metro to the aquarium on our visit to Copenhagen and it was a great afternoon. We had lunch in the cafe, the food was good and reasonably priced relative to other meals out in Copenhagen. Versus other aquariums there was a lot to educate the kids on sea life and",
          "We visited the aquarium with our kids and were quite happy with it. Lots to see and explore and among other things, couple of huge tanks where you just could stand for hours in front of them and watch. Be sure to take 10 kr coins with you if you don't want to carry your coats",
          "Large aquariums are great with some spectacular exhibits. The sea otters were my personal favourite. The rest of the fish were also really amazing. The building is a real architectural triumph. For me, there was just something missing about the experience. I can\u2019t quite put my",
          "We were there early and saw the ocean aquarium tank being fed. This involved a guy in a rubber dinghy dumping fish out while being bumped by sharks - a braver guy than me! We absolutely loved the sea otters!! It is huge and would be brilliant to let kids loose in, the rainforest",
          "A very nice and modern aquarium. Not sure whey they keep the sea otters, but nevertheless, a good trip. Food in the cafe is of good quality, but a bit overpriced. The sea life is in excellent condition and the staff are friendly enough. Three to four hours should be enought, get",

          "Lot's of marine life and fishes. Was a fun place to go as a nature-fan, even though a bit too many fishes to my taste. Loved the sharks and the playful otters, and of course a cup of coffee out side the cafe-place when sunny and warm!",
          "This is a lovely aquarium to visit if you have kids or general interest in sea life. It\u2019s definitely not as large as other aquariums in the world, but this makes it manageable, especially if you are on the way to/from the airport. Highlights were the beautiful tank of coral",
          "As aquariums go, this one is beautifully laid out and quite extensive in ambition. But what was particularly impressive was the palpably sincere attempt to involve children and bring the wealth of nature to them, without being preachy or didactic.",

          "We visited on a Monday when the aquarium is open until 9pm. There was lots to see and we were impressed by the layout and information available. I particularly enjoyed seeing one of the otters fast asleep floating on the surface of the water. Entrance was free with the",
          "The big tank contains quite a bit of shark and stingrays. The aquarium is not very big and divided into 3 sections. In the tropical section, they do have those large tropical fish. It worths a visit if you have the Copenhagen Card.",

          "My daughter wanted to visit this place while in Copenhagen. We took the metro from town and arrived at the nearby metro station. Took about 15 minutes to the aquarium by foot. Directory was not so clear and we were using the mobile GPS to find the building. The weather was good",
          "The free shuttle bus from the main station is useful but you need to have admission tickets to use it. The aquarium was a little disappointing overall. Possibly the smallest aquarium I've been to. Some of the shows were partly in English which was helpful.",
          "It looks great, most of the shows are in Danish, but you can ask the staff for more detailed information if required. It\u2019s not that big though, you can be done within 1,5-2 hours.",
          "It's about a 10-15mn walk from the station, in the rain it feels longer, but you can get a bus which drops you at the entrance to the aquarium. The building from photos looks fantastic, but as it was raining non stop we didn't get to admire the outside. Inside there is lots of",

          "We visited Den Bla Planet mainly because it was cold and wet outside but we had a really delightful few hours here. The building itself was fascinating- very modern and beautifully laid out but as always the animals and fish made the visit. I have always loved sea otters and to",
          "This place is amazing. All exhibits are in English as well as other languages. It is maintained so well and is just beautiful It is large and there are a lot of people but it flows really well. We spent several hours there and saw everything. It does not smell fishy and it",
          "We stopped here for a visit before our flight as it's only one stop before the airport. They allow you a locker to store your case and the restaurant is very nice with good sea views. Theres a rainforest and a large viewing wall and tunnel with sharks which is very nice. Good",
          "We took a family trip out to the aquarium today and had a great time! It is a wonderful place for kids, the exhibits are visible enough that my one year old could see everything from his stroller. We loved watching the sea otters get their breakfast and the other exhibits were",
          "Came here on the wettest day I spent in Copenhagen and it was the best way to stay out of the rain. Relatively easy to get to via the metro trains. It is also free to enter with a Copenhagen card. The aquarium itself was pretty large and predominantly split into 3 sections",

          "Place where you'll find many interesting things to learn, see, and even touch. There you can spend the whole day with family, friends, and even alone. The majestic atmosphere of the ocean will attract and seduce your mind.",
          "While I find that most aquariums around the world look alike, this was very nice. A good variety of species and there are interactive screens with info about all the species right next to where they are. The building design is also very cool.",
          "The clean aquariums were nice, loads of different species and guiding information on interactive tablets. A nice place to spend the morning or afternoon. We have been to quite a bit aquariums around Europe, and we would rate this one above average. Also a good place to with kids.",
          "Conveniently located to a Metro station, it's a very well-designed aquarium with some excellent exhibits. Enough room that even when it's busy people can move around. Family-friendly, and not so noisy that people without chlldren won't enjoy themselves.",
          "We enjoyed our visit, it is easy to get around, and there are some amasing creatures to see. But parking is DKK12 an hour, and it is expensive to visit, and there is a fee for using a credit card.",

          "Den Bla Planet is located next to the CPH airport and easily serviced by the Metro at Kastrup. They have managed to provide the aquatic life its very own habitat by cordoning off a little portion of the Baltic Sea for this aquarium. Wonderful experience and the variety of sea",
          "Really great aquarium. Amazing shark tank. Sea otters. Friendly and informative staff. Beautiful view over the harbour. The cafe serves beer and evening meals. Nice playpark. Warning: playpark contains water. It is possible to stay dry easily (unless you're an 8 year old",
          "We bought tickets online the same morning to avoid standing in line. We also brought our own picnic as it is expensive to buy food there. They have storage lockers, you need a 10danish crown. The aqarium Itself is very nice and there is information at every aqarium, for more",
          "We had planned to come here anyway, but great rainy day excursion. Its quite far away so plan ahead!",
          "The large aquarium was quite an experience. I was also impressed by the deep sea exhibit. There was actually hands on, where people could touch crabs and sea stars. The major downside was the number of people in such a small area. The restaurant was nice, although it took time",
          "Many nice exhibits in a lovely setting. There isa free bus to take you to the Aquarium and Back. Lunch is adequate.",
          "Loved this place. Lots to see. All posting and information provided in english on touch screens next to all exhibitions. Great cafe with quality tasty fastfood. Walking distance from metro station \"Kastrup\" Remember to buy tickets in advance, and avoid peak time at all costs,",

          "A nice place to visit with the kids.The very long queue should promise something, and \"Den Bl\u00e5 Planeten\" met our expectations. One thing was very annoying: As we had bought the Copenhagen Card, equipped with a QR-code, it should be totally unnecessary to wait in the line for the",

          "My family loves aquariums so I felt this one oversold itself a bit as 'the largest in northern Europe'. It was great but not noticeably better than Birmingham, Portsmouth or Berlin. I particularly liked the large tank with the sharks and rays in. - the hammerhead sharks were",
          "If you haven't been to a big aquarium before this is a good choice on a rainy Danish summer day. Beware - the storage area eats away your 10dk without returning them (each time you lock it) - unlike every other public place I visited where you would get your money back after you",
          "Really impressed with the aquarium. Each tank has a screen where you can view all animals in the tank and then read more information on each, changing language between danish, Swedish and English. Very well laid out.",
          "We were impressed by this aquarium, having visited some other major ones like Sydney, we were pleasantly surprised by the range of things to see. We especially enjoyed the otter talk and the beautiful rainforest section. Lots of interesting things to see and read with touch",
          "We were a bit disappointed with the size of the aquarium. Took us just short of 2 hrs to walk through. Tanks are beautiful and great care has been put into this aquarium. Just not big enough to warrant a second visit.",
          "This is a wonderful acquarium, best I have ever visited. The fish are displayed in a variety of settings and we particularly enjoyed seeing the sharks. The live coral was also beautiful and the tropical rainforest section really interesting. Highly recommended to visit.",

          "Travelling with my 5 year old son on a day when the weather suggested that indoor attractions may be the most appropriate so this was top of the agenda. 7 metro stops from Kongens Nytorv and 1 from the airport, the journey out wasn't too bad. The aquarium is signposted from the",

          "With a Copenhagen card entrance is free as well as the metro a 10min stroll away. Not the largest of Aquarium but great informative displays. Best was the otter feeding and then the Pirahana feeding. The keepers presentations are full of enthusiasm and informative. My wife's",

          "The title says it all. Wonderful displays, interesting information. There's supervised touch tanks and a chance to see the sea otters being fed which I would definitely put on your schedule and if children don't pull you along, sitting and spending a little time in the hothouse",
          "It is a fun place to spend an afternoon. A compilation of all kinds of aquatic animals can be seen here. My favourite part was definitely the Amazonas part where butterflies fly all around you.",
          "If you are in Copenhagen for long time and have nothing to do, then ok, about 15 pounds for ticket and you there. The aquarium is not big, compare with Sydney, Miami or Dubai, and has actually just one aquarium. Summer time seems to be busy, long queue outside, very slow ticket",
          "Den Bla Planet aquarium was a very pleasant excursion, easily reached by metro about 20 minutes from the city centre. Highlight was an exhibition (possibly temporary) about peculiar deep sea creatures, some of which were discovered as recently as last year. Presumably because",
          "We were disappointed after travelling to get to the aquarium. I think I prefer the one on St Malo, and the tanks seem bigger there. We did have high hopes, sea lions and whale sharks were promised by the website, but we're not in evidence. I wanted jelly fish, and though there",
          "We came and had a fab time! Lots of animals very educational and fun and interesting! Even had a segment on Loch Ness - made us scots feel right at home \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Worth half a day visit. they have some spectacular marine life in this place. They have a special interactive section where you can touch marine life. There were staff on standby who were very knowledge and were at hand to explain the species displayed. There is a huge aquarium",
          "The venue on the whole is ok - there is lots of fish as you would expect. Things that would interest kids and also a mini rain forest with the heat of the amazon which we were quite impressed with. But the main attraction was the giant aquarium with an abundance of sea life.",
          "The aquarium is really nice and well made, is definitely easy to reach with the public transportation. Tickets: the single ticket is not so cheap but with less more you can buy the annual pass that is valid for 365 days. After your purchase of your single ticket you have some",
          "Usually we go see only the historical monuments and cities of the countries, being a bit of a history/castle fans but this aquarium attracted us with their website, so we decided to take a chance. Three different underwater worlds that leave you amazed by the variety of sealife,",
          "We went with our two cildren, aged 6 and 3, with the hope of something spectacular. As it often is when the bar is raised to high, the experience sometimes isn\u00b4t quite up to it, unfortunately. The layout is somewhat confusing, and the individual aquariums are not that",
          "Our 4 yr old and 19 month old loved it, especially the tanks where you can touch the crabs & fish. Not sure how good that is for the crabs and fish though. They had some healthy things on the menu in the cafe and the food was really tasty. Beautiful views while you're eating",
          "Very nice little aquarium. The kids loved it and they had some very nice displays...Easy access from a hop on hop off.",
          "Perhaps I have been to too many aquariums. Favorite parts:restaurant which served fish and chips and a delightful wall with superimposed LED(?) images of fish of all varieties swimming. Approached by patrons touching the wall, the fish scatter and regroup after the intrusion.",
          "Things can be quite tricky to find in copenhagen if you rely on public transport even if you are armed with several maps,but this one is dead easy, signposted all the way, they even announce it on the metro tannoy large aquarium wiht a cool tunnel going through the hammer",
          "Huge collection of underwater world. It is divided in 3 areas, really easy to navigate through. The app provides tons of info which can also be accessed via touch monitor next to each aquarium. They also offer variety of shows throughout the day. We watched 'feeding the Otters'",
          "Very disappointed with the experience. There\u00b4s not enough space for the many fish, especally the big tank is not really that bog. It feels cramped just looking at it and you feel sorry for the fish. The archicture, however, is really cool. Maybe just go there and take pictures",
          "I visited this aquarium. I does have fish and birds but no amphibians and no invertebrates unlike some aquariums but I still I liked it. It is walking distance from Kastrup metro station.",
          "A great experience that the whole family enjoyed a whole lot. Easy parking, great facilities and not too time consuming exhibitions",
          "This was well laid out and very interesting. The Rain Forest area was unexpected and the size of the tank was great. There were lots of varieties of fish and information about them all in English.",
          "If you love acquariums you will like this even though it is fairly average on world standards. If, like me, your interest in fish extends only to how they taste with garlic and butter then you will appreciate the great architecture and location of the place.",
          "We had the Copenhagen card so did not pay extra to go here. If you have the card and young kids, it's probably worth it. Otherwise, skip it.",
          "As usual, everything in Denmark is very well designed, all the information is very clear, and very entertaining using the new technology combined with traditional approach. The only negativity is that the souvenirs can be considered very expensive..",
          "I came here just because it looked good from what I've read. The place is really huge! Lots of different types of fishes, starfish, Sea otters, sharks. It's an impressive set up just around the corner from the airport. If you wanna spend a couple of hours to see something",
          "Fun place for kids.... lots of fish of all different kinds; sharks, rays turtles and even some snakes and spiders you can touch Make sure u make it there around 12:30 for feeding time...you can view the bigger fish being fed in the giant ocean tank. I saw a huge ray munching",
          "The aquarium itself is stunning and the views over the water amazing! The aquarium itself is quite small but very well laid out. A bit out of the way but easy to get to on the city Bus!",
          "We had a long day near the airport before flying home at the end of our wonderful vacation. Our hotel recommended the aquarium, which was an easy 20 minute walk away. The walk along the marina was beautiful. The aquarium captures all we've experienced in Copenhagen. It is",
          "Escaping the rain we took a trip with the subway to Kastrup and a short walk to the aquarium. I think they have shuttlebusses - best to check online. Great display of sealife from different areas of the world. Good information (interactive, multilingual) and an underwatertunnel",
          "We came on June 4th, 17. It was the first rainy days after several good days outdoors. Seemed like a good idea to come by on our last day, bound to the airport. Just that everybody else seemed to have had the same idea! To the administrators, they should limit the amount of",
          "I had a morning free before my flight from Copenhagen and decided to visit the Blue Planet. It's a 15 minute walk from the airport and really pleasant. Not as impressive an aquarium as some, but very well organised , the setting by the coast is great and the Sea otters were",
          "We went along to the Blue Planet on the last of three days in Copenhagen. We had no idea of what to expect (except fish, of course!) We began in the Nordic/Cold Water section, and came across the touch pool of the aquarium, manned by a staff member called Rasmus. There we were",
          "This was a great place, with lots of scientific activities for the children to do as well as great fish exhibits. My 7 and 4 year old boys spent hours playing with the waterworks machinery, in particular the Archimedes screw. The fish exhibits were excellent and it was a great",
          "A bit off the beaten track. But worth the taxi ride to get there. They say it is the biggest acquarium in Europe. There is something of interest for everyone.",
          "It is an interesting aquarium located in the beautifully designed modern building. Although not the biggest comparing to other European Aquariums, this one has plenty of exhibits area which cannot be seen in other aquariums. It also has a distinct part dedicated to Baltic and",
          "Having visited other aquariums in Europe, this one seemed very small! It is however definitely very clean and the settings outside are really pleasant on a sunny day.",
          "Quick word: I am beyond the age for aquariums, and so the idea of visiting an aquarium does not entice me much. But visit I did, and it is certainly a fab place to go to, especially if you have young kids. The aquarium is very fun, interesting and educative place for kids.",
          "This is a very nice and educational place to take your children and grandchildren. The aquariums are very informative and easy to understand with displays next to each aquarium. Even their playgrounds for the kids are very nice with water games and climbing stands.",
          "Such an amazing building it really is a great piece of architecture! The inside is just as amazing, so many fish we had never seen before. Well worth a visit for adults and children alike x",
          "Free for Copenhagen Card holders. Very good for children, they will discover a new world, the sea world. Reachable by subway and S-train. You will feel like a kid again there.",
          "When we finally found this place it was worth it. We had asked many people how to get here but not many seemed to know where we were talking about. Anyhow we finally got a train which got us there. It was about a 10/15 minute walk from the station and thankfully there were signs",
          "I was in Copenhagen for 3 days and didn't plan to visit the National Aquarium, however when one day the weather wasn't quite as nice we decided to make the trip and spend some time at indoor attractions. I'm so glad we did as it's a lovely attraction with lots to see and some",
          "Its not too easy an access to this attraction without a car. But once there I felt for it! This is a well maintained and wonderful aquarium with lots of different fishes from around the world, even a designated tropical fresh water land and marine life section. Very",
          "It is a metro 2 stop before the airport, or bus 2A to Kastrup St or Airport bus 5C, stop before the airport. Its a couple blocks to the aquarium. There are three different venues for fish including fresh water, salt water, and the rain forest. it was all interesting. I just",

          "Den Bl\u00e5 Planet, the National Aquarium Denmark, is a small but very exiting aquarium. The most impressive part is the very big aquarium with the sharks and sting rays. The service peoples are very friendly",
          "We had a great time here. 3 adults and we still enjoyed it. What we found great for the families that were visiting here was the facilities. You had a place to hang coats, store luggage if you were on your way to the airport, lockers if you wanted to lock things away, and an",
          "Awesome experience for both adults and kids. Nice area surrounded but the sea, and many beautiful marine animals you don't always get to see - it's definitely worth the ticket price!",

          "Really well designed and presented aquarium. Good variety of fishes and animals shown in 3 areas. They have also a rather good restaurant and a nice playground for kids outside. Much better than for example the Genova Aquarium which claims to be one of the greatest in Europe but",
          "It is a nice acquarium but a bit isolated...it is shameful that besides the expensive ticket you also have to pay for the parking space! The place is nice but compared to other European acquariums (genova or valencia to name two), it does not leave you breathless",
          "I think this is a great place to visit for all ages, we spend about 3 hours attending the events during the day, great education, and all the tanks are really interesting.",
          "this is a great place to visit in copenhagen. Kids, Adults everyone. easy to get to, a bit from the center",
          "Been to many aquariums around the world and this one for sure is one of the better ones. It has all the expected species you would expect in most aquarium. Given we are in Nordic land it was great to see an emphasis on the local species. Worth a visit if you are in marine life.",

          "I'd seen most of the other attractions here so I made a reservation to go behind the scenes to feed the sea otters and visit the aquarium. The special ticket was expensive (350 Kr) in addition to the 170 Kr admission fee. The sea otter experience was worth it. Two zoo keepers",

          "Free with Copenhagen Card: Yes The aquarium is geared slightly more toward children but is still a solid experience for adults. Fun animals to see, with fun facts displayed in several languages. My favorites were the rain forest, the coral reef, and of course the open sea type",
          "Located on the bay with view over the bridge. Also great to watch landing airplanes. Cafe has not a huge selection of meals but everything we've tried was delicious. The big tank with the tunnel makes it nice to have sharks going kinda around you but to say the truth piranha",
          "Visited with a 3-year old, took the metro from the city centre, which was easy. The walk from the metro station to the aquarium is sign-posted. I am surprised that some say that the aquarium is quite small; I felt it to be quite big (certainly a bit too big for the 3-year old",
          "This is the best aquarium I've ever been to - the variety of aquatic life is massive and there are interactive touch screen displays at every tank (and an app to download which gives you all the info too). The viewing area of the sea otters could have been better as you can't",
          "You can get here by metro and it is included with Copenhagen Card. Fairly small if compared to other similar places. Three sections - we wandered from 2 to 3 by mistake and were disappointed that it all ended so quickly. There is a big tank with a small tunnel you can walk",
          "Their collection is not that huge but it is quite interesting still to explore. I also enjoyed the outside which has views of the water/beach, has picnic tables, playground for the kids but you can still have a spot for yourself if you like peace and quiet. I think Dutch people",
          "Free with a CPH card. I have been to better aquariums but worth a visit if you land in CPH in the afternoon - 15mins from airport",
          "This location is suited for families with children. Besides nice aquariums, there is a possibility to learn some practical things about the sea-life. In general, I would advise others to visit at least once this aquarium.",
          "We're glad we had the Copenhagen Card which gives entry to museums such as this; we wouldn't want to have paid full price. Despite the billing, it turns out to be quite small and surprisingly quickly done. The cafe is also small, and very limited in food, you need to eat",
          "Den Bla Planet is the national aquarium of Denmark and one of the best aquariums we have seen in the Nordics. The architecture of the aquarium itself is mesmerizing and the interiors are well designed as well. The aquarium is divided majorly into three sections: 1. Northern",

          "This was on the Copenhagen card and you can get to it by bus. (As quite a bit out from town and right near the airport). You are greeted by staff with their fancy dress costumes on and smiles all round. There is loads to see and I could have happily just sat there gawping at",
          "When arriving at the Aquarium you know that it is something special the architecture of the building is wonderful, even on a very wet dull day the buildings silver shell and shape were exciting. The Interior is well laid out with zones clearly defined, the exhibits were well",

          "It was pretty similar to other aquariums as is to be expected but nicely laid out and easily walk-able as not too big. Nice big tanks with good variety of fish as well as some that you can touch",
          "This acquarium is located just One metro stop before the airport, so we decided to go with our luggages. We could out them in the lockers provided. The entry price was about 43 euros for two people, and in monday it's open until 9 pm (usually until 6). The Aquarium is huge and",
          "We went to Copenhagen in February and desperately wanted to do something in Copenhagen that was warm. We headed to the Blue Planet and spent hours there. The range of species is great and there is a really lovely calm atmosphere here - not manic like London Aquarium. They have a",
          "Worth a visit. Outside of the city centre you will need a car, train or bike. Lovely fish, big aquarium, plenty to see.",
          "Would not have been my first choice to visit, we went there because we had kids in the company, but I ended up really enjoying it. There is a lot see and experience, well worth the trip to Kastrup.",
          "I love walking around looking at all the fish and learning all about them. Was very glad to see English was available everywhere to read. I loved watching the Otters as well. I didn't mind that they, (understandably), chose to only do the Otter talk in Danish as I was too busy",
          "We took the Metro to Kastrup, from where the Blue Planet Aquarium is well signposted. There is lots to see at the Aquarium and information panels are clear and easy to use. Some of the lighting graphics are amazing and caused a lot of amusement for the children visiting the",

          "Took my wife on Valentine's Day 2017 and importantly she had a great time. Keeping my wife happy aside, this is a really good place to visit. The aquarium has a bit of something for everyone. As a couple we had a lot of fun and the loads of kids there seemed to be having a",
          "Good day out. Quick metro trip from centre of city. Near airport. Worth the trip if you want something different to do in the day. We was there for a few hours. \u00a320 an adult. Perfect for families with kids. One of the tanks is massive.",
          "As we were travelling on our first city break with our 7 year old, this was on our 'to do' list and it did not disappoint. This was an excellent 1/2 day trip with plenty to do. I would recommend getting there early as the queues were building up when we left at lunch time.",
          "overwhelming, so take your time to see it all child friendly, even the little ones good food in the restaurant - caf\u00e9",
          "So this was super close to the airport and we jumped on the metro and one stop away got off and a ten minute walk or so to the actual aquarium. Dragging our bags across was a bit of a pain, but well worth it especially as we could dump them in the large lockers. It was super",
          "A nice modern aquarium. Large tanks. Lots of interesting sea life. Decent caf\u00e9 (they had live jazz that day). A bit crowded with small kids.",
          "Being inside the Blue Planet is depressing. The fish are beautiful but the place has no soul. All the questions you may have about the animals are left unanswered. There is no information anywhere. I will definitely not come back.",
          "We went on a very cold day - impressive building a short walk from the station, but best are the displays - lots of room around them, lots of view points for the main tanks and the puffins are so sweet. Good cafe too with view across the sea.",
          "I'd travel back to Copenhagen just to see this again and to spend a lot longer in here. In fact I'll be doing exactly that very soon.",
          "My daughter loves all kinds of animals and creatures so wherever we are we have to find a zoo and an aquarium.This is without a doubt the best we have been to.There is so much to see and there is a little caf\u00e9 where you can sit outside and watch the planes coming into land at",
          "If you're interesting about sea life, you must visit the Aquarium. You can reach easily from downtown with metro or bus",
          "Quite small so didn't really understand the largest in Northern Europe tag. Good way to kill an hour before flying though as close to airport and suitcase size lockers.",
          "Just remember that it's really near by the airport. So you may visit it right after your arrival, or right before your departure. I did it, and the Fish & Chips at the restaurant is not a bad idea to have after watching so many fishes \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A beautiful new Aquarium with incredible displays and a social message of why we need to save the oceans. Easy to visit via train from the city, but also provides free bus transport to the Central train station. We loved the sea otter demonstration, which proved they are not",
          "This is not an aquarium only for local fish and sea species. It has the most interesting design, interior as well as the outside architecture. Do not forget to go outside to se the feeding of seals.",
          "When in Copenhagen you cannot miss going to this palace of fish and design. The display next to every tank are touch operated and give all the info in English and the displays and fish are spectacular. Entrance is 170k each about \u00a320 worth every penny very close to the Metro",
          "Very modern building. Well laid out. Plenty of loos/storage lockers/coat hanging space. Just next stop on Metro from Airport. Signs for each exhibit interactive in Danish, Swedish and English names. Several areas to sit and watch. We particularly liked watching the sea otters.",
          "A must see totally worthwhile visit- interesting, informative and great to see fish habitats from all over the world!",
          "Located only one stop from the airport on the metro line and with luggage facilities for cases this is a must see. Beautiful aquarium in large spacious building. You could sit relaxed watching the fish for hours.",
          "Many different kinds of fish, nicely displayed and in well kept aquariums. The sea otter show was very nice and well told by young staff members. We visited on a Monday around lunch time and it was quite a lot of people there, yet didn't feel crowded or difficult to see",
          "The aquarium is realitively small but modern and stylish with a good selection of animals on show. I was particularly thrilled by the hammerheads. I also had one of culinary delights of my life with the roast pork sandwich from their cafe. I'm not sure if it was as good as i",
          "Easy to get to via trains from central station. Lots to see. Lovely knowledgeable young lad who was talking with us about shark eggs and crabs in section one(forgot his name) all other staff seemed lovely. Nice restaurant",
          "Heard this place becomes like a stuffed mushroom on the weekends, so decided to come visit an early Monday afternoon in January, which meant the place was almost deserted. Unfortunately it only made it clear how rather small the aquarium is. The aquarium is divided into 3",

          "I am not really into aquariums if I am honest, but my 8 year old really wanted to go. I have to say it was fantastic and definitely worth a visit. We used our Copenhagen pass and had about 3 hours here and there is loads to see, There is a cloakroom and lockers which was great",

          "We went to visit the aquarium on New Years Eve, the exterior of the building is very impressive although I have to say the walk from the Metro to the Aquarium was along dull and empty looking roads, not so bad on the way there but on the way back it was pretty creepy, i was",
          "Deb Blas Plant is situated outside the main area of the city, relatively close to the airport. With this in mind we planned our visit for out last day in the Country, so that we could drop our bags at the airport and take a taxi to the aquarium. Wow what a brilliant place,",
          "We were able to make it through all three areas of the aquarium in about 1.5 hours. The exhibits were small, but informative, and all displays were presented in both Danish and English. We visited on Christmas eve and got the special treat of watching Juleman (Santa) feed the",
          "Visited with a group of friends and the place was great. Though in the dead of winter, the place was still warm enough. I loved the variety of the creatures (not just fish) that the place had, including the puffins, seals and parrots (they were out of control!).",
          "Fantastic, engrossing collection of marine biomes. Enormous in scale and ambition. Top attraction in Copenhagen. Skip to oil and go blue",
          "There were large fish in a big tank where you could sit for long periods and watch the sharks and rays swimming a few feet away. There were many smaller tanks of colourful tropical fish, sea snakes and shell fish. Well worth the trip.",

          "This was an enjoyable afternoon out. The aquarium is a short bus ride out of central Copenhagen, and is very modern. There are a number of smaller exhibits featuring specimens from particular regions, but the main attraction is a massive floor to ceiling tank. In addition to the",
          "We came here on a Sunday. It was full of small kids as expected but it was amazing how many adult couples there were. This is an excellent aquarium, very well laid out with detailed explanations in Danish, Swedish and English. It's really good fun to visit and just one stop",
          "This is billed as the largest aquarium in Europe - the others must be very small. It is well laid out, and about a 10 minute walk from the nearest Metro station, and about a 15 minute walk from the airport. There are luggage storage facilities for all sizes of bags. Check the",
          "This is a beautiful aquarium and a lovely place to spend a morning or afternoon. Definitely a \"must see\" if you have kids. Our only regret was not being able to share the experience with our grandkids.",

          "Its a nice place, but my 4yrs kid didn't find it interesting. Maybe its focused on one older kids.. Many different kinds of sea fishes \ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc20 and etc, but nothing the kids could touch and experience. Go to the Zoologisk museum thats way more interesting for all ages of kids.",
          "Very well organized aquarium with a good show of plenty of animals in different seas. Free with Copenhagen ticket, or pre-booked ticket is recommended",
          "The Danish National Aquarium is an impressive venture. Nonetheless, all involved must have missed their ethical courses. Ther eare pitiful-looking puffins, it is very doubtful that the Californian otters should be kept there on display at all, and the giant arapaima do not seem",
          "I think the aquarium is not too big but despite that it has huge tanks and it looks fantastic. Great combination with modern architecture and aquarium. I do suggest to visit the place and your kids will surely enjoy it if they like finish. The current restaurant offers some nice",
          "This is a very well put together attraction. There are over 50 tanks with different species including a jungle room with high humidity. My wife and I really enjoyed it. And it was easy to get to on the M2 train from Copenhagen central or Nooresport stations",
          "It's pretty expensive, but it's worth a visit. The design is great, my son loved it. They don't have many bigger animals, and the only interactive exhibit was the otters, but that was worth the visit itself. They have an awesome playground out back, with a view of the ocean.",
          "The aquarium was smaller than I expected but made for a pleasant visit on a rainy Danish autumn day. The touch screens offer a lot of in depth information about the animals and I especially enjoyed the fascinating information about sharks.",

          "Never thought I'd write a good review for a tourist attraction, but it was really good. The menu was developed by Meyers Kokken, which seems quite popular in Copenhagen, and in conjunction with the guys from Noma. We had the fish and chips, fish cakes and salmon salad. It was",

          "Visited the aquarium on a busy Saturday afternoon. Entry was included as part of the Copenhagen card, as was transport to and from Kastrup via the metro. We enjoyed our visit but found it to be a little underwhelming when compared to Copenhagen Zoo and how much time it took to",
          "This is a great and exciting activity for families to learn about marine life. Maybe also the marine life gets to know a little about life on shore as there were many eyes behind the walls of glass gazing back on you. Maybe the most impressive sights were the tropical forest and",
          "About a 20 mins cab ride near the airport, this Aquarium is worth checking out. There's a large viewing area where you can see really close up, as well as a tunnel where you're surrounded by marine life. Also simulated rainforest, and adorable otters playing and splashing",

          "The aquarium itself is very modern. I liked the visit.\nBut there is a string atached, leading to my rating:\n\nBe aware of the parking system. The parking barriers are open, suggesting a free parking. Indeed they are filming your car plate. \u2026",

          "Really cool Aquarium and if you are there at the right time you can see the feeding of the fishes and otters. If you go outside you are by the ocean and can watch the planes land at the Copenhagen airport. The only critic I have is that it has only three sections. Really kid friendly though!",

          "It was a good exhibition of the oceans and forrests. I was expecting a little bit more to be honest. I loved the petting fish station and the doctor fish nibbling the dead skin of my hand. I enjoyed the man made forrest. Facilities like these are gems and should be treasured.",

          "Really nice aquarium. A bit small, but it has most things here from the lake, rainforest, to ocean creatures. The exhibition is good, tho it could be done more eye catching. Otters were really cute. The place is easy to get to using \u2026",
          "Great place. Ioads of interesting tanks, some huge ones, e.g. the coral/tropical marine tank I could have watched for hours! Clean tanks and healthy fish.

          "It's okay but a bit underwhelming considering the fact that it was recently built. It should be the best in class but seemingly more has been spent on the outside than the layout of the inside. Such a shame. I doubt I'll be returning as I \u2026",
          "The aquarium is very small and very expensive. It's suitable for families with children! If you stay for 4 days in Copenhagen is better go around the city!",
          "Actually 3.5 stars, because we have much better aquariums in Europe...Like Crete's in Greece , Genova in Italy and Valencia in Spain.. Great staff!! Congratulations guys!!",

          "The best Aquarium I have visited.. it should be in your list if you\u2019re visiting Copenhagen with your kids. don\u2019t miss the feeding sessions. \nDefinitely worth it. \nThey do accept Copenhagen card.",
          "I\u2019ve been to few aquariums and I would consider it a small one. It is nice stop over before going to the airport. But I would not go here twice.",
          "It's worth a visit if you're nearby and need to spend a rainy day inside. But it feels small, and when you have seen everything, well, you have seen everything. But again, it's still worth a visit on a rainy day :-)",
          "Really nice. U can actually touch some fish... a lot of species are in there. There's a space to relax and enjoy the view of sharks swimming...",
          "Very nice place, interesting programs, very children friendly!",
          "This place is amazing, alot of sea life encounters. My kids loved it. Our visit from the US was short l but definitely I would go back if I get the chance.",
          "the fish feeding show is good to watch esp. in the big aquarium",
          "A beautiful place whit all kind of marine creatures. Great place to spend whit children.",
          "Good aquarium with large tanks. One of 3 places showing sea otters",
          "Feels like a museum, its interactive and available in English. Amazing animals",
          "The National Aquarium Denmark is the place where you can see the most beautiful creatures of the see and oceans.  Here you have a big variety of fish and shark and there is a tunnel vision where you can walk and see them in their habitat. The aquarium is not so far away from Copenhagen so it's definitely a \"must see\" experience.  :) \ud83e\udd47",
          "Reserve a full day for this one. My 4 years old liked it, especially the fish-petting. There is an external playground for kids.",
          "Visited with my friends. Even though I am not much of an aquatic wildlife enthusiast, I still appreciate this place. The tanks are nice and there is lot to see. If you get tired of the crowded interior, you can go outside where you can \u2026",
          "It was great experience",
          "Good aquarium that is full of different fish and sea creatures. Absolutely loved the talks from the staff and the water/kids area outside is really good. Quite expensive but then again aquariums/zoos are quite expensive anyway.",
          "Visited the aquarium today. It is absolutely fantastic the best I have ever been to. The exhibits are very well presented and kept my 3 children (age 7,4 and 10 months) engaged. The outdoor playground was also great \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Wonderful! It was a nice experience. Definitely recommend it!",
          "Good and new place but not the best, been to few other places in UK I feel UK one is better than this one.",
          "Well taken care of, wide variety of animals, a nice tunnel and a huge water tank with some nice animals like sharks. The areas where you can touch the animals are great for kids and adults alike. Totally worth the visit.",
          "A very interesting aquarium with a beautiful design. The views are amazing and it has activities for all the family. You can make the complete tour in 2.\nThe metro line M2 is 8 minutes close walking and the next stop is close to the \u2026",
          "Good for kids, lots of hands on exhibits",
          "Amazing aquarium. Definitely worth visiting. Besides aquarium there is a playground for children and chill out area by the sea for adults. Highly recommended!!!",
          "A must go place with children and family!!!  Worth the try. Enjoyed it thoroughly",
          "Very good place. Well maintained.",
          "I had an awesome time here.\nI\u2019m not even sure if there\u2019s anything I could say that hasn\u2019t been said yet.\nAnton, the guide, was super nice and knowledgeable; calmly answering all the questions. With a mentionable sense of humor.\n\nThe whole \u2026",
          "Impressive outside design as well as the main aquarium where u can see several type of sharks and Manta. Also kids will be so please of caressing the small mantras!",

          "Loved it, recommend a visit \ud83d\ude42",
          "This was a perfect monday evening.",
          "Plenty of well thought-out displays. Bring earplugs and enjoy the visit in relative silence. Like a fish in water.",
          "cool place to visit, I liked that much. I Definitely, recommend it",
          "Well organized and fun to watch the feeding times.  There is a petting pool to touch the stingrays. It\u2019s small compared to other aquariums I\u2019ve been to.",
          "The aquarium in itself is nice, but it was too crowded.",
          "Great acquarium, but not quite as good as I expected given the advertising.",
          "Smaller than expectation but nice to visit. If u r lucky then u can see feeding also",
          "Very nice place to visit. I really liked this Aquarium. I would love to visit there again in the future.",
          "Cool place, good layout to the building. Nice atmosphere and lighting. Alot of different fish on display. Wished there was a dolphin show, more underwater experience.\nChildren will have a good hands on experience with fish.",
          "One of the best parts of our trip to Copenhagen. We spent just 2 days in Copenhagen, but made the most of it, and finished with the Aquarium due to it being very close to the airport.\n\nIt's a short train journey out to the Aquarium and then \u2026",
          "Architectonically very impressive place. As a family we experienced interesting trip at this place. Variety of species combined with interactive learning stations within exposition tour give at least 4 hours, better whole day to be planned \u2026",
          "Ok, not that much to mook at.",
          "It's very OK, nothing special compared to an aquarium in any other major city. Very few fish unique to Denmark of course! Usual sections on rainforest, coral reefs, etc. Good for kids. Close to the airport, so you might consider it if you have spare time for a layover or something like that.",
          "Great place of beauty. If you hate kids, you shouldn't go \ud83e\udd7a",
          "Amazing aquarium with wide sea life available for display. Th restaurant adjacent to the aquarium provides a spectacular view of the sea. A must visit",
          "Fun place to be in with kids...very much accessible by train...good collection of aquatic forms ..also has a play area and sit out by the sea...which can lovely on a summer evening...trust me it's a stress reliever...just to surrender to the silent sea...overall a must visit...and the kids would enjoy touching the star fishes...",
          "Awesome! It has the little fish that eat dead skin and let people try the sensation",
          "Lots of fun, for all ages.",
          "Wondrous and peaceful place to visit. And plenty of inspiration for any age.",
          "Nice exhibition for both kids and adults!",
          "Not sure if I've ever been in an aquarium as a kid but I doubt it. I enjoyed it very much! Even tho there were lots of kids around, it was close to Easter holidays, so I guess that's why!",
          "This is the best Aquarium I've ever visited in Europe. I could spend all day long here. There are so much themes and fishes which I can rarely see in the nature. They seem also happy to be here I think. I thought the staffs are doing well \u2026",
          "Very good place you can see different kinds of fishes , you can spend full day with kids here",
          "Great aquarium, visited in winter and a great place for spending 3 to 4 hours with children. Otters, small sharks, loads of interesting tropical fish, interactive bits for the kids, including touch pool which is enjoyed. Restaurant felt \u2026",
          "Fine place to visit with your friends and family.",
          "It is the place where you get acquainted with aquatic life on Earth. You will experience live endangered species of whales, shark, snakes fishes. etc.",
          "Some of the tanks appear to be over populated and there is (in my opinion) inadequate room for the larger species on display. Clearly designed for an up close experience for the visitors but disapointed that animals should be kept/displayed in this way.",
          "The species were really unique and I really loved the sharks! You should definitely go there.",
          "Gotta say was very fun and interesting. Lots of cool weird sea life creatures. Should be visited by everyone! Was very crowded as well. Great for families and anyone.",
          "Loved it! My sister was here visiting with her family and the kids were amazed and so happy. Pricey, but would highly recommend . You are able to bring snackd or packed lunches.",
          "A really fantastic experience. Highly recommended for a trip with friends or family. Kids will particularly find this interesting and there are loads of activities for them. If you can make the feeding times even better. They have a section for different aquatic environments and the set up is really well done.",
          "Cool place for kids and adults. Worth seeing. Good kids play ground. Spent there all day.",
          "Amazing place! Very relaxed and i enjoined it !",
          "National Aquarium of Denmark is located in the outer areas of the city. However the place is well connected with public transport. The aquarium is having highest world standards. There\u2019s a large variety of aquatic animals. There\u2019s a special \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to go. Perfect to feel small in the glory and wonder of our beautiful blue world",
          "fine aquarium, especially the feeding in the ocean tank is well made.",
          "Beautiful experience. A Must visit!",
          "Great design building. The aquarium is well maintained. Although is not that big but all the fish are very lively. It locates near the airport so your kids can see both the airplane and the seal show outside. Highly recommend for family. There is 10% discount from Copenhagen boat tour in town.",
          "Fantastic aquarium. Hands on exhibits, shows and friendly knowledgeable staff. Great outdoor play facilities too for the warmer months. A definite highlight of our trip to Copenhagen. Easy to reach from the metro service.",
          "A smaller place than you would expect. Yet it hides a lot of knowledge and activities  beneath the aesthetic exterior.",
          "Big enough to spend a day here. I met my beloved fish :)",
          "Very good collection of fish specimens. Well laid out and useful information available on cards adjacent to the species. Very colourful fishes, some rare varieties from round the world categorised by fishes found in ponds, lakes, rivers and oceans. Good informative visit for school going kids. Prepare to spend one full day.",
          "Loved it. As good for the children as for the adults.",
          "Don't rush the visit.  Great place for kids",
          "A beautiful place, a person can even touch on some creatures, we find here indoor and outdoor exhibitions. I was most impressed by the tunnel through the large aquarium. I could look at it all day.",
          "Well laid out with informative interactive screens on all tanks.  Good cafe if a touch expensive to UK prices",
          "Beautiful place with a lot of majestic sea creatures.",

          "Easy to get to - metro or parking, good selection of fish, clean, tidy. Good family day out",
          "So beautiful, love where we could touch the fishes, really worth it. There is a good place to eat inside the Aquarium too!! Perfect place for children and adults. Must go with time so you can see everything, there are a lot of sections and do not miss the time they feed the fished and otter",
          "A good place to kill a few hours on the way to the airport. A must visit if you are with kids. They can have the time of their life dipping in the pools and playing withe some of the fish",
          "A wide variety of aqua fishes and animals here.. specially piranha fishes... And the biggest screen for sea animals like shark and big fishes..",
          "Very nice location, for children's very good place :)",
          "Great place, highly recommended! They have attractions for any age. Interesting and safe place to visit with even small children. We've enjoyed our holiday there!",
          "Its such a wonderful place. Had an amazing time.",
          "Wow! It was my first time to visit any aquarium and it was great. I'm in love with arctic puffins. I would recommend parentes to definitely take kids here. Of course there's different price range for kids tickets. This is place that I could visit again.",
          "Really nice place. Wonderful views. Lots of fun for the kids (including touching things like starfish).",
          "This aquarium is absolutely beautiful! There are so many things to see! I wish I could stay here all day.",
          "Free shuttle available between Central Station, aquarium, airport. Great attraction for kids and adults. The main ocean aquarium is very impressive. Scheduled demonstrations throughout the day which are worth attending.",
          "For every family with Kids. This is the place You can stay for 4-5 hours. Very interesting and many things who Kids can play.",
          "I wish it were bigger but loved the aquarium. \n\nBig fan of all the exhibits though the tunnel made me dizzy and get a headache because of the distortion.\n\nThey have a huge range of animals and shows including a piranha feeding!!",
          "Awesome aquarium, definitely among the best I\u2019ve seen!",
          "Love it. It is big enough.",
          "4 million liters aquarium, with the most spectacular sea life, i have ever seen together thriving,  and well kept. A pleasure to watch. A lifetime memory.  Special mention to Ewunia The Turtle. Well done everyone!",
          "I was alone but the experience was still great, amazing diversity. The only thing missing were some Pacific fish. Very informative and it wasn't that expensive either. Probably the best exhibition was the Amazonian one, the birds were very \u2026",
          "Loved the aquarium. Lots to look at. 5 mins from a lovely beach too.",
          "Most amazing aquarium I've ever been to, really well laid out, excellent selection of exhibits. Would recommend this as a must visit place if you come to Copenhagen. Only a short walk from kastrup metro.",
          "A wonderful location for a fine aquarium. The way the exhibition developes is interesting, all and all it is a very beautiful and intriguing experience. Restaurant has great visuals on the sea, food is nice, but service is slow and unorganized: do not skip it but just consider you will need more time than the usual.",
          "A fantastic aquarium housed in a architecturally pleasing building. Each tank has a digital screen well explaining the species found, and they have educational programs throughout the day designed to be entertaining and informative, for \u2026",
          "Really amazing time at the Aquarium, highly recommend!",
          "Fantastic collection of fishies! Sting ray, otters, sharks, coral, mini rainforest. So much biodiversity to enjoy and learn from within these walls! Information is presented catchy enough to read easily with pictures, graphs, and \u2026",
          "Loved that place! Visit it",
          "Very impressive aquarium, breathtaking tank sizes and plenty of hands-on displays. Good restaurant too.",
          "Excellent aquarium, very informative and the under water tunnel is mesmerising. It is huge and has something for everyone. Look out for the timings of the show at different places in the aquarium.",
          "Sea otters were cute but sleeping when I was there so did not see them perform.",
          "Family friendly in every way, curation and the message about the environment",
          "Was cold outside but it is winter. Inside is nice and warm, just about the right temp. They have different aquariums with different species of corals and sea animals in them. Great information screens with danish, Swedish, and English as \u2026",
          "Nice and modern, many beautiful aquariums, and interactive touch screens with details of every type of fish and sea creature. Expected it to be bigger, but still worth the visit. We apparently went during winter holidays or something, so quite crowded with families. Probably better on more quiet days.",
          "Marvelous place for spending time with family. \nA huge number of different types of sea creatures.\nAnd of course there's a moral side of animals captivity for any aquarium. Thus feel bad about animals in a touching exhibition",
          "Nice aquarium but we were able to finish it within 1 hr. Tip: they have free shuttle in the summer to Copenhagen Central station and the airport. Just present your aquarium tickets when you board the shuttle.",
          "This was a lovely visit. The big fishtank is breathtaking",
          "Danish water life the strangest in the world with Baltic Sea fresh water to North Sea sea water and gradient of salinity along the brackish North coast.",
          "It is an amazing experience, I fully recommend for all families. It's really close to Copenhagen downtown. You can reach easily with the metro (if you come from the airport it is only one stop). I loved it \ud83e\udd70",
          "Awesome place, incredible sea show",
          "I love the place and often spend many hours here with the kids. Petting fish, playground and the shark tank are creazy good. I'm leaving one star out, as the exit requires you to go through the gift shop. This always ends a great day with arguments and crying children. They should change that!",
          "A very great experience. Very interesting for children,interactive and engaging . Will recommend.",
          "Very interesting and informative with very polite staff",
          "Grt place huge water tanks and lots of censory play stuff for the kids including hands on play with the fish etc",
          "Decided to try the aquarium as it was open later today and included free entry with my Copenhagen pass. Was really impressed with the variety of the exhibits and the detailed knowledge provided in multiple languages. I was lucky enough to \u2026",
          "We as family enjoyed our visit to Interactive Aquarium\nIdeally you can finish all show points with in 3 hours\n\nIt was also amazing to see the feeding time and the very good care being taken about\n\nHas nice small restaurant \n\nPlease be \u2026",
          "Very small, but nicely laid out.",
          "Quite enjoyable experience, the tanks are all very beautiful. If you have children there are some open tanks where they can play with some of the fish and touch them. There are organised activities and feedings that are also pleasant to \u2026",
          "Good food. Really helpful employees.  And a great place for kids to learn and play on.",
          "With the Copenhagen Card it's worth a visit. Not sure if I'd pay separately, although some interesting features and interactive elements for kids.",
          "A amazing place to spend the whole day. Very close to the airport then a good choice if you have a half day before taking the plane",
          "I was expecting more wild life, and the place to be much beager. You don't need more than 2 hours to visit the entire place. Best part is that you can sit in front of a big glass wall and watch turtles and sharks. There is only one restaurant with very few options, and you have to pay every time you use the locker.",
          "Definately worth to see. The architecture or the building is amazing. It is surrounded by yhe water.\nIt is located next to the airport (by walking distance) so you can visit it before the flight or just after. You can leave your lagguage for 10crown there. Outside you can spend time relaxing by the sea with a great view.",
          "A good stop to take the kids to while visiting the city.",
          "Very nice aquarium.  The arctic tank, Amazon rain forest and Otters are great, but the shark tank is the show stopper and not to be missed.",
          "Specimens in very good condition, water quality excellent, layout good. Must have time to enjoy visit.",
          "Easily accessible and family friendly",
          "I love the big fish tank with all the sharks. It's like a big screen TV.",
          "Great place to visit. A lot of beautiful and different fish.",
          "Great place to visit. Lots to see and touch.",
          "Good place for kids but it\u2019s not too big. It is divided into 4 departments so you can visit in 3 or 4 hours . Also there is a restaurant and ground for kids to play.",
          "Fun, interactive, informative and sooo soothing. Take your time to sit down and enjoy life in water. I will be back to take a break from real-life stress and worries. Medication for the soul!",
          "Nice building and facilities. Have many species to visit",
          "It's a fun visit and I think the price matches the cost of life of Copenhagen. But it is a sort of disappointment for tourists to pay the entrance amount and be out of there in little less than 2h. A good thing to visit with children before heading to the airport (just a 25min walk distance), but not a must see of Copenhagen.",
          "Not big but very substantial, pedagogical and great fish viewing experience",
          "It was amazing, a lot of things to see and do.",
          "Great place to spend your entire day. Aquatic life, presentations, food, sea-view. It takes a full day if you stand and understand everything about these beautiful marine creatures. Sharks and Seals were the stars.",
          "Quite a good variety of fish. The marine tank is impressive of them all. There is a small area where you can try to touch some small fish as well. The most interesting part of the visit was the feeding session of fishes which was at 13:00. If you are visiting try to see the feeding of the fish. It's amazing",
          "Just okay..... definitely a must for kids",
          "Beautiful aquarium on the outskirts of Copenhagen, we took the train which was about ten minutes from central station, the aquarium was a well sign posted 10 minute walk from the station. \n\nReally nice exhibits from cold and tropical waters \u2026",
          "A cool aquarium that has a bunch of fish from all over the world. The biggest attraction is their big salt water ocean tank that you can walk through. To be honest I expected more, because it was over hyped a bit. Apart from the big tank, \u2026",
          "Good place one time visit",
          "Has to be my all time favourite aquarium all the animals had plenty of space and all looked relatively happy. The otters we're amazing and one of their star attractions. They had an massive tank which held all their sharks and beautiful sea \u2026",
          "This was our first activity in Copenhagen. Right next to the Airport. It was beautyfull!! I loved every minute of it.",
          "Well maintained aquarium with regular shows. A bit of the way but worth a visit. Close to the airport so if you're transiting through CPH a great way to kill a few hours if you have the time.",
          "The architecture of this building is so marvellous! This place is ideal for a family visit! Wonderful activities for the kids outside, plenty of species of fish and gorgeous tanks and displays inside. It was fun, educational and we enjoyed \u2026",
          "Nice place to visit once, other wise ok ok.",
          "Phenomenal. You can not look away.",
          "Beautiful building. Lots of the usual marine life. Sharks, Ray's etc etc",
          "Biggest turtle I have ever seen. Plus the sea otters were a treat to watch",
          "I love this aquarium with all my heart, I'll keep coming back there every time i fly to Copenhagen <3",
          "best aquarium!!! agnes and jojo (sea otters) are soooooo cute! will go again just to see them!",
          "Great aquarium, very close to the airport, just a stop away. Good if you have a few hours to crash before your next flight. You can also enter for free if you\u2019ve bought the copenhagen card. If you are a fish lover, this place is for you. \u2026",
          "Very nice and well done aquarium. It has many different types of marine life in a wide range of sizes. It would be a fabulous place for kids in the summer because they have an outdoor playground with water puzzles. My kids loved the \"touch it\" exhibit. It took our family about an hour and 20min to go through the entire thing.",
          "Good to see. had much fun. Kids love it",
          "Very well designed aquarium with several interactive exhibits",
          "Lovely place......well maintained....and a must visit..",
          "This is by far the most beautiful aquarium I\u2019ve ever been to! The architecture alone is worth a visit and the view over the sea is amazing. \nThe staff here is also super friendly.",
          "The big ocean adventures presented in a fun inviroment. A must visit in Copenhagen!",
          "Wasn't the best but still pretty cool. Deserves to cost a bit less though.",
          "All the aquarium is unbelievable, you will get to see from fresh water pond's life to the salt water ocean life. You might get to see occasional extra activites of the staff there during the visit.  Great place to visit with the family.",
          "Beautiful building, with fish from around the world. Large basin with sharks. The aquarium is generally not that big.",
          "Beautiful architecture, but a bit small comparing to the one in Okinawa, still a good spot for family visit!",
          "Nice place well worth a visit. A little to expensive for a family.",
          "Very nice, but the prices on food and drink etc. are very very high so bring your own there's a nice picnic are outside with tables",
          "Spectacular design and can tell your kids it's an UFO from outside \ud83d\ude0b. You can have an interesting time inside, plenty of diversity and you can watch at certain times how the feeding is being made. When we went was something, as the place was opened in the first day of the new year!",
          "Was a pretty fun experience. Love the diversity.",
          "Great attraction for the kids.  Very close to the train station for easy access.",
          "Fantastic place for adults and children alike. Our 2 year old loved it. She was able to touch crabs and starfish and there was a great play area for her too.",
          "Kids will love this place. Outdoor kids play area is really good",
          "Superrrrr organised and top staff. Smiling and very nice people working there.",
          "More small children than fish today. Saturdays are clearly to be avoided by adults without children. I was disturbed to see one display including terns and eider ducks. The fish may not need the whole ocean to swim in, but sea birds should not be confined to glass cages.",
          "It is a very nice and modern building with very informative and interesting exhibition. The fascinating large aquarium is the highlight.",
          "I would very much recommend this plus over other famous and costly attraction in Copenhagen. This place is heaven for water babies and sea lovers, you can visit there many programs. Also I would suggest to check their website before \u2026",
          "Well-organized aquarium with good fish tanks. Otters are cutties!",
          "This is an excellent, well designed, aquarium. The highlights for me were the piranha tank with both above and below views and the otter feeding event (you should really try to catch one of these shows when you are there, they are utterly \u2026",
          "Adorable place,though too many people and the water tunnel smaller than expected. Nonetheless highly recommended to visit.",
          "Theres so much to see at the aquarium, we visited on a weekend and were lucky that it was fairly quiet. Its got a really open and accessible layout, divided into three sections so you can be sure to see everything and not get lost. All the \u2026",
          "Beautiful day. Restaurant packed and slow. I wish we had brought our own food. Next time!",
          "Perfect place for everyone",
          "Ticket prices are too high!\nThe experience is quite good. There are plenty interesting sea creatures and the corals look almost too vibrant and colorful to be real. The place gets very noisy, if there are a lot of children screaming, which there usually are, caused by the fact, that there is no sound dampening surfaces.",
          "Worth spending  a day here. Restaurant area towards sea I like the most.",
          "My second time in Aquarium ever , It was amazing , I really enjoyed the large screen display in the big aquarium and the tunnel.\n\nUnfortunately I went to see it on the last day of my visit to Copenhagen so I had only slightly more than one \u2026",
          "Great place to come and bring your kids",
          "Good location. Only one stop from CPH metro. Place is rather crowded so try to choose not popular days and hours. In fact is not so big, but very well organized and with beautiful huge aqua screen. You can feel like sitting in the cinema \u2026",
          "It was a very nice aquarium, but it's smaller than I'm used to. It didn't have a jellyfish section, which surprised me. I got to watch the otters eat and they were adorable. Lots of things to do here especially with children. Tons of fish to see, and they have a little rain for a section. They have food and a cafeteria.",
          "Great exhibition! Lots of thing to see/try.",
          "I felt like no balance in price and experience",
          "Breathtaking views of the nordic marine fauna, exotic fish and there habitats and the fascinating world of coral reefs. \nThe large aquariums with sharks and rays has to be seen to be believed. \n\nI do take pity on these animals which of \u2026",
          "Small. Recommended for small children. Touching the fishes is awesome for them.",
          "Excellent and completely worth the money.",
          "Nice aquarium. Not very big. In restaurant bad food. Zero options for healthy food. Only french fries as a side order. Low quality of sausages. Nothing i would like to give to my or other kids.",
          "A 'must see' for any nature loving tourist visiting Denmark, only 15 min away from Copenhagen's airport.\nLoved the ocean otters, the touch pool and the main tank, with its tunnel and the numerous sharks and stingrays that swim by, over your \u2026",
          "Great day out for all ages",
          "I love the place! So much inspiration I got from sea animals",
          "A little much to get in for how small it is but still a place worth visiting.",
          "Ok ok kind",
          "Great sea otter show and comments...loved the theater seating for the shark and large animal aquarium, loved the tropical fish and animal life aquarium",
          "Fabulous and interactive aquarium. Love the architecture. Food in cafe is also good. Lovely location.",
          "It's divided into three parts. Pond fishes, lake and river fishes and the mighty ocean. Perfect place to learn a lot about the fishes",
          "Very beautiful ocean view with a lot of sea animals",
          "As a vegan I found it cruel to have the animals caged in a similar yet fake habitat to their owns. It was exciting to observe them from so close but at the same time the big picture was kind of sad. It is just my opinion. There might be many people who do not see it like that. But personally Icould not recommend such and experience.",
          "My children loved this aquarium. The particularly enjoyed into pools where you can hold starfish etc. The sea otters were great fun to watch.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Especially if you are the owner of the copenhagen card.",
          "I love this place. It has a very nice and beautiful outer view of water and land. There are different types of things that can make you feel you are really in the world of sea. I feel excited very when I see dragon \ud83d\udc32 fish or sea horse. \u2026",

          "Best.... Every penny worth",
          "The architecture of the building is very beautiful.\nBig enough, mostly three \"rooms\" with subsections. Very beautiful reproduction of natural environments for different species. Great and suggestive the one for the ocean species. It's easily reachable by metro at the Kastrup stop (the one before the airport)",
          "Nice place to take the kids.",
          "We loved the attractions!",
          "I found it particularly boring. Is not huge either, is a 2 hours top kind of tour.  Nice coffee and cafeteria it's ok. The kids enjoy more than anything being able to touch some little fish they have in an open tank",
          "It is located very near to Copenhagen airport & in a close proximity to kastrup metro station. A must go place specially if you are a fan of sea water life. They have many large glass walls & a big lobby from where you can see big fishes \u2026",
          "Beautiful selection of sea creatures. Knowledgeable staff and interesting program",
          "Amazing aquarium! Had a great time, loved the otters",
          "Going to den bl\u00e5 planet was definitely a great experience!\nThe aquarium itself is very well organised. I was really impressed by how helpful the staff was, with young members called \"tellers\" walking around and helping you understand more \u2026",
          "Visiting Aquarium was a nice experience on the way to the Airport. At the end of the show we stopped just outside of the building and our daughters played in the playground while me and my wife had a tea looking at the seaview.",
          "Incredible Aquarium. The salt water section is a given, but I have rarely seen such diverse freshwater exhibits. Brilliant African and South American display aswell as national freshwater fish. For anyone interested in the aquarium hobby, it is well worth the entry to spend the whole day here! The food is also good.",
          "Pretty, but somewhat limited for what you pay. We made the mistake of coming during the school holidays, but despite tge crowds it didn't take us very long to see everything there was to see.",
          "A little bit small, but really cool",
          "Very child friendly place where they can touch almost everything. It is very interactive and people can join in on the fishes mealtimes and see how the tanks are cleaned aso. You can also bring your own snacks and eat them in a picnic area.",
          "I have been there at least 4 times. And I love it even more every time I go.",

          "They accept to many guests at the same time. Waaay to crowded. Spoils the fun.",
          "It's a nice aquarium, but it won't compare to the ones in Valencia or Barcelona. It is very expensive for adults. Exit through the souvenir shop is a cheap move, given that many people visit with kids, but prefer not to buy another plastic toy for them.",
          "Fantastic place to visit!",
          "Nice place to visit with young kids. They allow you to touch and feel few marine animals like star fish , crab at one place. Kids enjoy that part the most.",
          "Beautiful aquarium just a quick metro ride from Copenhagen. The aquarium is broken up into 3 zones to make it easy to follow. Several times a day guest are encouraged to watch the animals  get fed. There is an amazing view outside the restaurant where you can grab a chair and enjoy the view from the dock.",
          "The blue planet is on point for institutions that handles live animals. The displays and the care of staff is so high. \n\nThey just got a little shark that only got its specific pattern for the first two weeks of its lifetime. \nWe were 5 \u2026",
          "Honestly for the price that you have to pay for entrance it was quite disappointing, which is 25 euros per person. \nFirst area of the aquarium is absolutely pointless; Fish in lakes and rivers in Europe (which is very dull as half of the \u2026",

          "Overall a good experience, although there are a few details that haven\u2019t worked out.\n\n1)There is plenty of fish, but the aquarium is quite small if compared to other European ones. Fish look like they are well treated and there is a sea \u2026",
          "Aquarium was wonderful, with a lot of sorts of fish. Kids had a blast. You can bring your own food to eat at the picnic area. There are locks for your bags that cost 1\u20ac. I would recommend waiting for feeding of sea otters,  piranhas and sharks!",
          "Its the Best aquarium I have ever seen in Denmark you Should visite....I cant wait to visite this place again",
          "Lots of aquariums with different species. Really big fishes too. Prepare to get impressed. The building is roomy enough for everyone to see what they want to and you can bring your family or go on a date here. Done both and recommend both.",
          "Great place... Different aquatic life from piranha to hammerhead shark to sea otter, et al. We were lucky to witnessed the octopus coming out from its hiding place...",
          "A beautiful place to visit, the largest aquarium in Europe.",
          "Architecture (being a huge selling point) looks underwhelming. Designed in a way that allows for \"modern look\" photographs for architecture blogs does not wow a visitor.\n\nInterior is crammed. Some of the tanks are clearly too small for its \u2026",

          "Beautiful and huge place, definitely a place to visit. Its gorgeous already outside \ud83d\udc4d\nWhat I liked most was biggest aquarium with sharks \ud83e\udd88 and rays; connecting tunnel (you can stay there forever\ud83d\udc99); otter feeding and small aquarium with \u2026",
          "Definitely one place to stop while visiting Copenhagen. Lots fish to see and lots things to learn. Clean and well organized as the rest of Copenhagen. Saw shark and sea otter feeding, amazing! Some part of exposition is interactive, in some cases hard to figure out functions. I missed penguins and sea snakes.",

          "Great experience under sea",
          "If you are either passionate for animals or you simply like to visit beautiful modern buildings, you should go there. A wide display of exhibitions of dofferent animals in a modern building with unique architecture makes going to this place a beautiful experience to enjoy.",
          "I travel a lot with my grandchildren and we have been to many aquariums in different countries and cities. This was on the top of my list as far as exhibits and tanks.

      "name": "Kastellet",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Kastellet, (English: The Citadel) located in Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the best preserved fortresses in Northern Europe. It is constructed in the form of a pentagon with bastions at its corners. Kastellet was continuous with the ring of bastioned ramparts which used to encircle Copenhagen but of which only the ramparts of Christianshavn remain today.\nA number of buildings are located within the grounds of Kastellet, including the Kastelskirken (\"Citadel Church\") as well as a windmill. The area houses various military activities but it mainly serves as a public park and a historic site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== St. Anne's Redoubt ===\n\nKing Christian IV of Denmark initiated Kastellet\u2019s construction in 1626 with the building of an advanced post, the Sankt Ann\u00e6 Skanse (English: St. Anne's Redoubt), on the coast north of the city. The redoubt guarded the entrance to the port, together with a blockhouse that was constructed north of Christianshavn, which had just been founded on the other side of the strait between Zealand and Amager. At that time the fortifications only reached as far north as present day N\u00f8rreport station, and then returned south east to meet the coast at Bremerholm, the Royal Shipyard. However, part of the king's plan was to expand the area of the fortified city by abandoning the old East Rampart and instead extend the rampart straight north to connect it to Sankt Ann\u00e6 Skanse. This plan was not completed until the mid-1640s, shortly after King Frederick III succeeded King Christian IV.\n\n\n=== The new citadel ===\n \nAfter the Swedish siege of Copenhagen (1658\u20131660) the Dutch engineer Henrik R\u00fcse was called in to help rebuild and extend the construction. The fortification was named Citadellet Frederikshavn (\"The Citadel Frederik's harbor\"), but it is better known as Kastellet (\"the citadel\").Kastellet was part of the defence of Copenhagen against the United Kingdom in the Battle of Copenhagen (1807).\nChristen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848), Danish painter associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting, grew up in Kastellet and made many paintings of the area.\nDuring the German invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940, German troops landing at the nearby harbor captured The Citadel without resistance.\nKastellet was renovated 1989\u20131999 with funds from the A.P. M\u00f8ller and Wife Chastine McKinney M\u00f8llers General Fund.\n\n\n== Layout ==\n\n\n=== Gates ===\n\nThe Citadel has two gates, King's Gate on the south side, facing the city, and Norway Gate on the north side of the edifice, which both date from 1663 as part of Ruise's original citadel. They are built in the Dutch Baroque style, and are on their interior side flanked by guardhouses. The King's Gate is decorated with garlands and pilasters, and a bust of King Frederik III. The clock and two bells on the interior facade of the gate come from the Central Guard House at Kongens Nytorv and were installed in 1874 when the central guard moved to the Citadel. In front of the gate stand two so-called caponiers from where it was possible to keep assaulting troops under fire. The Norway Gate used to face open countryside outside the city, and has therefore been built to a more simple design. The caponiers of this gate were demolished in the late 19th century.\n\n\n=== Bastions ===\n\nThe five bastions are named as follows: The King's Bastion (Kongens Bastion), The Queen's Bastion (Dronningens Bastion), The Count's Bastion (Grevens Bastion), the Princess's Bastion (Prinsessens Bastion) and the Prince's Bastion (Prinsens Bastion).\n\n\n=== Moat and Smedelinien Outworks ===\nSmedelinien (English: The Blacksmith's Line) is a system of outworks, separating the inner and the outer moat, located to the south and southwest towards the city. It consisted of four ravelins and three counter guard interconnected by long, low earthworks. On Fyn's Ravelin, one of the eponymous forges has been preserved and is now used by the park authorities. Another forge was built on Falster's Counter Guard in 1709. Rebuilt in 1888, it now serves as residence of military employees. When the Free Port of Copenhagen was constructed, the northern portion of Smedelinien was dug away, but the remaining part was put at the disposal of the City of Copenhagen in 1918 and now serves as parkland.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\n\n=== Commander's House ===\n\nThe Commander's House (Danish:Kommandantboligen) served as the residence of the commander of Kastellet. It was built in 1725 in the Baroque style by architect and master builder Elias H\u00e4user who also designed the first Christiansborg Palace which burned in 1794. Built in yellow-dressed masonry with white detailing, it consists of two storeys under a red tile roof. The triangular pediment is decorated with a relief and Christian VII's monogram under topped by a crown. It is now the official residence of the Danish Chief of Defence.\n\n\n=== The Rows ===\n\nThe Rows (Danish: Stokkene) are six two-storey terraces which were originally built by Henrik Ruise as barracks for the soldiers based at the Citadel. The dorms measured four by four metres and contained two triple beds, a small table and two benches. Over time they became known under individual names: General Stock where the commanders resided until the Commander's House was built, Artillery Stock for the artillerists, and Star Stock, Elephant Stock, Swan Stock and Fortuna Stock. The Mansard roofs are not part of the original design but date from 1768 when the rows were altered. The original roof profile is today only seen at the end of Artillery Row as seen from the Prince's Bastion.\n\n\n=== Southern and Northern Storehouse ===\n\nThe two storehouses also date from the foundation of the Citadel. They were to store everything need in the event of a siege, and could when full feed the 1,800 men of the garrison, other personnel, and their families for four years. The Southern Storehouse (Danish: S\u00f8ndre Magasin) served as an arsenal while the Northern Storehouse (Danish: Nordre Magasin) contained a granary.\n\n\n=== Powder house ===\n\nThe Powder House at the Queen's Bastion, which was used for the storage of black powder, is the only surviving of originally two identical powder houses which were built by Domenico Pelli in 1712. The other one was located at the Count's Bastion. It was designed with massive walls and a slightly vaulted ceiling to ensure that a possible explosion would move upward and thereby cause a minimum of damages to the surroundings. When in 1779 a powder house at the East Rampart exploded, causing damages in the Nyboder area and all the way to Bredgade, it was decided  that it was too dangerous to store explosives at the Ramparts, and the powder houses at the Citadel instead came into use as a jailhouse.\n\n\n=== Church ===\n\nThe Kastelskirken (\"Citadel Church\") was built in 1703\u20134 in heavy Baroque style during the reign of King Frederik IV. It includes sound holes to the prison to enable prisoners to follow services.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\n\nA prison complex was built on the rear side of the church in 1725. Eye holes in the wall between the church and the prison cells made it possible for the prisoners to follow the church services.\nStruensee awaited his execution in Kastellet's prison. The English explorer and pirate John Norcross was the person to be imprisoned at Kastellet for the most extensive period. He spent 32 years in the prison at Kastellet, 16 of the years in a wooden cage.\n\n\n=== Windmill ===\n\nOn the King's Bastion, in the southwestern corner of Kastellet, stands a windmill. Built in 1847, it replaced another mill from 1718 which was destroyed by a storm the year before. The original mill was a post mill while the current mill is of the Dutch type.\nSince a fortified city needed secure supplies, including supplies of flour and rolled groats, in the event of siege, numerous windmills were constructed on the bastions. In 1800, a total of 16 windmills were found on the ramparts of Copenhagen. The mill at Kastellet is the last which is still working, while another one, Lille M\u00f8lle at the Christianshavn Rampart, was transformed into a private home in 1915 and now survives as a historic house museum.\nRussian Empress Consort Maria Feodorovna, daughter of Christian IX of Denmark, got her rye flour from the mill at Kastellet. The Army's Bread Factory would send it to the Imperial Court in Saint Petersburg where she was served \u00f8llebr\u00f8d every morning in the Anichkov Palace.\n\n\n=== Central Guard House ===\nLocated just inside the King's Gate, the Central Guard House was built from 1873 to 1874 with an attached jailhouse. The architect is unknown. It replaced the Central Guard house at Kongens Nytorv where the Central Guard had been stationed since 1724.\n\n\n== Kastellet today ==\n\n\n=== Military use ===\nThe Citadel is still an active military area that belongs to the Danish Defence Ministry. Military activity in the area includes use by the Chief of Staff, the Danish Home Guard (Hjemmev\u00e6rnet), Military Intelligence (Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste), the Judge Advocate Corps (Forsvarets Audit\u00f8rkorps), and the Royal Garrison Library.\n\n\n=== Visitation and museums ===\nIn spite of the continuous military presence in the area, the Citadel is today  a peaceful, protected area, serving as a public park as well as a cultural-historical monument. It is located close to Langelinie, The Little Mermaid, the Gefion Fountain. It is a popular place to go for a walk on a sunny day, and is very popular with children on account of the many animals and birds in the grounds, including Black-headed gull, Pomeranian duck, European herring gull, Grey heron and Mute swan. The site includes two small museums with limited opening hours. The Garrison's Historical Collections are on display in one of the guard buildings inside the North Gate. The other is the Livj\u00e6ger Museum.\n\n\n== Special events and concerts ==\nThere is a changing of the guard ceremony at the Central Guard House every day at 12.00. Military concerts take place at the drill grounds on summer afternoons at 14.00. The Citadel Church frequently arranges concerts as well.\nThe Citadel's birthday on 28 October is marked with an annual concert and the wings of the windmill. It is a tradition to promenade on the ramparts on Store Bededag, a Danish holiday, which is also celebrated with music.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPictures of Kastellet\nKastellet - Copenhagen Fortifications\nSource",

          "This was just across from our hotel, so we walked around the ramparts and through the centre on a couple of occasions, admiring the windmill and the historic buildings within this well preserved fortress. A relatively peaceful spot away from the hustle and bustle!",

          "A nice green area with some part with more trees, green fields, water and many different birds. You can meet there grey heron, swans, eurasian coot. And of course the old fort in the middle. The place give me calmness and rest. It is also a very short walk to the coast from",

          "My friend and I wandered through here en route to the Little Mermaid Statue - it is a working barracks, so tourists are only allowed down the main street and up around the ramparts, but it offers great views over Copenhagen and has a gorgeous, old aesthetic - great for some arty",
          "It's my favourite spot in town. Everybody just walks past it to go to the Mermaid but, hey guys, this is the beautiful part there! It's a green, relaxing place great to go jogging or for a walk. Don't lose time to see the super disappointing mermaid, come here!",
          "When you visit the mermaid then continue to the Kastellet for interesting and scenic views. Also if staying at Adina Apartment Hotel then this is a short cut into centre of Copenhagen.",
          "We stopped here on our city bicycle tour. You can park the bikes and have a nice walk around. It's right next to the Little Mermaid statue so it's an easy detour before or after. Great views of the harbor.",

          "We'd not planned to visit the citadel but stumbled across it when we were visiting the Little Mermaid statue and we're glad we did. It's a really nice place to explore, both around the buildings and grounds. There is a really nice memorial here too which commemorates the",

          "After Legoland this was a great brainwash. The weather was amazing. The kids enjoyed running around and walking around the trail on the barricades was refreshing. We started the walk in the Little Mermaid statue through Kastellet, finishing at Frederiks kirken.",
          "We walked on the ramparts of this star shaped fort after seeing St. Alban's Church and the Gefion fountain on the way to the Little Mermaid. It was quite beautiful and well worth the time and a nice break from the crowds around the fountain. It was probably my favorite stretch",
          "This is a peaceful place to walk. We walked to the windmill and around part of the outside. It offers great scenery and is definitely worth a visit.",
          "We were looking for the Little Mermaid and sort of stumbled upon Kastellet. After the Little Mermaid we just walked a short bit to the \"back\" entrance. We crossed the bridge through the gate and walked around a bit. It was very quiet and we even saw a few Danish Soldiers",
          "The Little Mermaid statue is past the Kastellet on the waterfront, so it makes sense to combine both in one visit. After the crowds around the statue, it's lovely to walk around this quiet old military settlement, walk up onto the mounds, admire the moats, the windmill,",
          "You can wander around the 'island' appreciate the landscape... there is a windmill too which is really well maintained. It seemed to be joggers paradise!",
          "Walking around Kastellet, the old fortress, and through Churchill Park is very pleasant way to start a morning. There are old barracks, a windmill and a church to see. It's close to the port, the LIttle Mermaid and other attractions, which can all be seen within a few hours.",
          "Most of the other comments cover the same ground, so I'll offer a slightly different perspective. There is a small chapel near the windmill in the fortress, and my friends were married there; in fact, we saw a wedding taking place while we were at the Kastellet. Another",
          "We rented bicycles from our hotel, The Admiral Hotel and were able to ride just up the road to the Gefion Fountain, the Little Mermaid and The Kastellet. We had to ride around the fortress to find it, but that was fun. Not many people were pursing a look so there were no",
          "Good to get out and see Denmark, lovely circular walk near to The Little Mermaid and Toldboden harbour restaurant/pub.",
          "This is a very pretty area and easily accessible. The walk around the grounds is impressive. It's not too crowded.",
          "This is a beautifully preserved windmill and definitely should be included if you are doing a tour of Copenhagen.",
          "Seek it out after viewing the Little Mermaid. It is a working fort with accommodation for soldiers, housed in interesting buildings. Amazing that you can walk through the middle of it! Take time to see the memorials to those who have died in various conflicts since 1948, and see",

          "We walked through the Kastellet on two different days, since it was a nice way to cut through from the city to our apartment hotel. It is a lovely, well manicured area, with very few people. There is a nice walking trail that encircles the compound and leads up to cannons and",
          "We stopped at this star fortress after visiting the Little Mermaid. We ended up being pleasantly surprised to have this be one of our favorite stops in Denmark. You can walk around the fortress and see the historic buildings, walk the path to see great sites of the city and",
          "Not far from the statue of the little mermaid, this place was used to defend the city centuries ago. A nice place to walk around.",
          "Go for a walk away from the Mermaid and you will come across some lovely sights of the city away from the 'crowds'. Discover other hidden gems and savour the space away from the centre.",
          "Nice place to rest and walk in the park. A lot of green around, calming, and what's more important, not very crowded.",
          "If it were my choice, I would skip the little mermaid and instead wander through and around Kastellet. It's a really nice place for a picnic on the grass, for a run/ride, or simply to sit and watch the world go by. Don't miss the old little church on the city side of the island",
          "I wandered around Kastellet, and the attached Churchill's park one beautiful morning with some cruise ship people. Kastellet is lovely, well maintained, clean, beautiful moat, the walk on top of the ramparts gives constantly changing vistas, and I found a shady bench under a",
          "While visiting the Little Mermaid I noticed what I thought was a pretty park with an artificial hill in the middle. Turns out to be a perfectly preserved 17th-century star-shaped fortress. When you cross the moat and go through a tunnel, you're in the middle of a functioning",
          "I went with my 16 year old son on the way back from the little mermaid. Neither of us were convinced we would enjoy it here but we both didI thought this was a beautiful relaxing picturesque place for a walk, he was thrilled at the defences and of the fortification and",
          "It's not the highest priority in terms of things to see and do in Copenhagen but since we're here 8 nights we had plenty of time. It was quiet a walk from our hotel and we're sure feeling it in our legs today! There are lots of things to see in this area so make a day of it,",
          "This fortification is still an active site. Being able to wander around and see how the fortification was set up and the views from the walls was well worth it.",
          "A really nice place for a stroll by the water. A must if you happen to be in Copenhagen during fine weather, particularly as it's free to visit!",
          "I love this place. It was one of my favourite places in Copenhagen. We stumbled on it on our way to The Little Mermaid in the early evening in May. It was so peaceful to walk around the wall, taking breathtaking pictures. It's free to walk around. Kastallet is one of the best",
          "Military buffs will love this sight, a superb example of Habour defences. We wandered through from first the botanic then Kings garden, through the Citadel then around past the overrated mermaid to the superb fountain before jumping on the 991 ferry to newhavn.",
          "Was glad that we had a little bit of time, before boarding our cruise ship, to visit Kastellet. A place with quite some history, beautiful maintained, worth the visit.",
          "As a matter of fact, this Kastallet is situated on one island, surrounded by the canal, on the border of inner Copenhagen and close to the port of danish capital, especially in the vicinity of the Little Mermaid Statue. We profited to make here one cool ramble along the paths,",
          "Originally I was on the fence about this place - maybe cool to see but it wasn't a must-do for me. But we stopped in, and it's gorgeous. We walked around to the windmill and then up a path that overlooks water and St. Alban's church. These were some of the best photos I took",
          "Came to the park to walk around, we grab some sandwiches at a gourmet mini supermarket, came to the park and had a glorious picnic. Walked around and surprised to see the windmill, very beautiful. Nicely landscaped, easy walking paths, plenty of benches.",
          "It's a very interesting and quite unique setting on the hilltop in the middle of Copenhagen. Quite impressive in terms of the views, cultural and historical heritage and scale. Most enjoyable in a nice sunny weather.",
          "But I'm not sure what I did expect...!!! The grounds are gorgeous and the windmill is charming and picturesque. Worth a stroll, as it is very peaceful and calm here. A nice way to spend one of Copenhagen's famously long evenings (the sun is up forever!).",

          "The area here is lovely to walk around. There are no admission fees and it is well tended. There are plenty of other sights within a few minutes walk of here so it is easy to do it as part of a route. It is popular with joggers too! It just needed a gelato shop somewhere and",

          "This is free to enter and not obviously an attraction, my partner and I decided to go in a different direction from Linguine Pier and found ourselves at the rear entrance, it's an old barracks, but still interesting to explore.",
          "I was walking around most of this area of C'hagen and wandered into Kastellet - ended up walking the entire the boundary - quite a walk - but relaxing, calm and connected to the history of the city",
          "We loved the castle but the windmill was such a treat. We'd just been in the Netherlands and didn't see a better one there.",
          "What a great place. A historic site this old fortress. A well kept oasis in the middle of a busy city. Great place for a stroll and picnic. Can easily be combined with a visit to the littele mermaid statue",
          "Not far walking from the Little Mermaid statue it is worth prolonging your harbour walk into the park and the city citadel. Efforts have been made to upgrade this former fortress. It looks great on a sunny day. Unfortunately there are no pubs neither restaurants inside for food",
          "It is just a short stop to get a picture. It is inside the Fort. There are some nice sites around this as well. So you could spend about an hour seeing everything.",
          "We spent a very pleasant afternoon getting lost in here and walking around the grounds and then around the entire raised perimeter. Very pleasant given the original purpose being a defence fortification. Easy walk to the Kastellet from the Little Mermaid statue nearby so you",
          "You can stroll along the ramparts of this old fortress above the moat complete with swans and ducks. Even an old windmill to photograph.",
          "Amazingly beautiful place. Despite the cold, nature generously endowed it with colors. Be sure to visit the park - even instead of some of the city attractions.",
          "Quiet place to take a stroll. Stop and see the little mermaid and the other sculptures near by. Easy walk to Amielenbourg palace for the changing of the guard.",

          "After taking pictures at the little mermaid with many other tourists, this is a nice place for a walk. There isn't much to see, a small war memorial inside, but walking along the bastions gives a nice view around Copenhagen waterfront.",
          "it is a very nice area to walk, very beautiful, well preserved fortress with long history. it is on the way to see Little Mermaid.",
          "Upon getting to or coming back from the Mermaid, it is nice to walk through the Kastellet, and ancient 5-pointed star fortress which is town. The old windmill overseeing the barracks gives an air of 'fantasy' to the place.",
          "Well maintained historic military structure reminding of old times, when fortifications encircled the city. Pretty buildings and gates, all laid out in orderly fashion. Makes for a great walk, either coming from the little Mermaid on the way to Nye Havn, or vice versa.",
          "It's where the war memorial is. It's quiet, and relaxed as most places in Copenhagen are. Nobody rushes you here. It's enroute to the mermaid so worth taking a stroll through the park.",
          "The place is right next to the little mermaid. If you have time, go to Kastellet and just walk along the path to enjoy the beautiful nature and fresh air of Copenhagen. This star-shape fortress is still owned by the military and once in a while, an officer would walk along the",
          "The Kastellet in Copenhagen has its pentagram ramparts remaining from when it was a fortress built in the 17th century, with the entrance gates and various later buildings including the chapel from 1704, the windmill from 1847 and the 18th century barracks known as \u201crows\u201d. Today",
          "Good for a walk in the fresh air....really fresh. I walked around the top and there were some good views but wouldn't say that this is a must do for Copenhagen, looks far more exciting on google maps then in reality. Prioritise Amalienborg and Christianborg over this",
          "The kastellet is a star shape fort for army dating from 1660, the buildings are nice but are not really interesting since you can't visit the inside, there's toilet and a windmill in the middle, good to see, for culture",
          "From Nyhavn we biked to Kastellet, after seeing the dissapointing mermaid, Kastellet made my day. It's a very beautiful place to walk arround, you can take awesome pictures, just chill and hang arround. Must see!",

          "Kastellet - the citadel is a lovely, peaceful,area og Copenhagen, AS it is closed to traffic. You may walk around om the walls and look down on the old army buildings- mostly from the 18th century-although the Citadel was established back in 1668. Observe the only still existing",
          "Interesting to have a look around, something different, very nice park, excellent place to have a training run.",
          "We walked from Nyhaven up through Churchill Park, through the military base and to the Little Mermaid. It is well worth the walk and you can always pick up some food from the Irma shop not far away. Interesting fountains and statues around the park.",
          "This was an amazing site to see and in such a beautiful and relaxing location. Definitely a must see. The grass around it was green which was nice also.",
          "This place is lovely in good weather, and very close to the Little Mermaid and several other beautiful places. So it's worth your time to wander around on you way to or from somewhere else. However, with all there is to see in Copenhagen, I wouldn't put this at the top of the",
          "Our family enjoyed walking through here, but the guards were sure to holler if you stepped onto the grass, which made it a tiny bit stressful with our two sons who really needed to run wild. Beautifully kept with pretty views, totally worth walking through on your way back",
          "Its souch a lovely fortress for a nice walk and a nice view of the ocean and admire a traditiobal old windmill and canyons from wars .You will enjoy it so much and its not at all far from downtown .You can see a little piece of the old Copenhaguen",

          "There isn't really anything to see there. Some nice park space to wander around if the weather is sunny but don't bother if it's cold cause the buildings are boring and if you want a park there are much better ones in the city. Disappointing.",

          "This area is lovely for a nice walk. You can go into the old fort and have a look around and at the top end they have a lovely old windmill. Wasn't very busy when I was there at 4pm I had just been to see the little mermaid what is close by.",
          "This well maintained area is perfect for walking! View changes round every corner. peaceful and plenty of benches to sit and relax. Used by many for running. this was close to where we were staying and we walked a different way through the park into the centre every day we were",

          "This place is such a great place to go for a walk and see all the beautiful sights from a higher point it takes about 1 hour to walk all of it! And if you walked through it you come across some beautiful traditional streets you will be very close to the little mermaid too so you",

          "Such a lovely early morning walk through the gardens. The way the sunlight hits the frozen water it simply stunning. You don't need to spend much time here but would thoroughly recommend even if it is just part of your trip itinerary to see the little mermaid.",
          "Very little to see here and no information boards. Keep off the grass signs everywhere but there is a path all the way around, up on the ramparts, which makes for a very pleasant walk. My Lonely Planet guidebook says there are excellent views of The Little Mermaid. That must",

          "Kastelet rebuild by the Dutch engineer R\u0171se and seems everlasting due to the way it's build. Still military, but open for public as a park to have a nice walk. We had a meeting in one of the formal storehouses with nice lunch and some fingerfood. Short walk from hotel Babette",
          "Kastellet is a truly beautiful green area near The Little Mermaid. Here you can find an old Mill and a cute little church surrounded by nature. I would recommend dropping by to anyone, it certainly was the highlight of my trip and quite a surprise for me because I came across",
          "I really enjoyed walking around the Kastellet. The buildings are pretty and on a beautiful sunny day, you could really enjoy a nice stroll around the area.. There are activities throughout the year so plan ahead.",
          "We had amazing weather while visiting Kastellet! There were not a lot of people, because the hour was quite early. I liked the contrast between the military houses and scenic green grass and cute bridges. We were short on time, so just walked through and not around, there was",
          "I would combine kastellet with the little mermaid, Gefionspringvandet, St. Albans Church. A great tour is to start at Skuespillerhuset which will allow you to have view of the Operahouse. Walk along the seafront past the old buildings, and the Quens Palace. Walk to",
          "This was on our way from seeing the little mermaid it is close by and a nice place to visit. There are also houses that soldiers used to live and it is a nice stop when you have time to explore the town and some time to kill.",
          "Being interested in military and its history, going to the Kastellet, you get to walk around the barracks and up on the rampart which is a lovely view and good fresh sea air. It's a good mile around and is utilised by local joggers and parents with their children in pushchairs",
          "Walking through you can see buildings of the fortress, lovely arch, wind,ill, and several memorials.",
          "After our disappointing trip to the Little Mermaid my son suggested this short walk through the fortification and Churchill Park. The war memorial was magnificent well designed and honored on the day. Going round the square we found many interested memorials to wartime heroes",
          "This scenic park is located just past the bronze sculpture of the Little Mermaid, toward Copenhagen. Definitely take the time to visit this locale, particularly if you enjoy taking photos. There are some good examples of windmills, historic buildings, a church, and canal.",

          "Nice respite from the other parts of Copenhagen. Very historic, and an easy walk. From the ramparts you can see how the harbor was defended.",
          "The Kastellet is a beautiful spot to do not a lot more than wander around or sit and watch the world go by. It's star shaped and on the morning I visited quite busy and full of autumnal colours. There was some sort of military something going on which meant lots of soldiers",
          "We went here early (I mean early) in the morning. And we were not totally prepared for the cold and windy weather. We chose the earlier time, so that when we finish we could walk over to the Little Mermaid site without all the crowds. This old historic fortification is",
          "Though the history of this fortification is interesting, as an original fortress built to protect Copenhagen, there is now not very much to see other than the moat and mounds . The site is still used as a military location. It is pleasant enough to walk along the pathway on top",
          "Well worth the walk round this beautiful place, it was bitter cold, but enjoyed the brisk walk. Very picturesque and worth a visit.",
          "HIghly recommend biking this park. If you walk you will not get to see it all. It is beautiful. You see St. Albans church, Gefionspringvandet, the Little Mermaid, a battery, a beautiful old windmill and picturesque scenery.",
          "If you are into long walks around outstanding places, this is your site. Cool in summer, colorful in spring and golden in autumn...",
          "I spent an hour in this beautiful park in the city. You can have a walk on the little hills around the typical red danish houses and enjoy some peace just a few blocks away from the heart of Copenhagen. Go there, it's worth a visit. Even if the weather doesn't look nice.",
          "This is one of the most impressive and very well-maintained fortresses in all of northern Europe. It used to be part of the original city's ring of protection. The great Danish builder King Christian IV initiated this massive construction in 1626, which too until the mid 1640s",
          "Nice park-fortification, you can climb up the external walls and have nice views, really nice the church near it. On the vay to the little mermaid.",
          "A marvellously preserved Citadel Fortress, still used by the Danish Military, dating back to the 17thC. Interesting scenic walks around the ramparts. It is still an active military installation so bear this in mind but the scenery particularly in autumn with the trees around the",
          "We visited on a Friday afternoon in mid-June and enjoyed strolling in the historic area. There were very few visitors, which made it very enjoyable. You can combine the visit with the Gefion Fountain, which is beautiful. Great way to escape the crowds!",
          "Kastellet and its surroundings are reminiscent of the Danish fear of the neighbours, a fortress overlooking the Copenhagen harbour. Nowadays walks on top of the fortress' earth-walled and star-shaped circomference are a much-loved pass time, and alows for a view of the harbour,",
          "It is very scenic to walk the hills of the old citadel but it is not really worth a visit for more than that, so if you don't have a lot of time on your hand while visiting Copenhagen, you will probaly be better off spending your time elsewhere in the city. A visit could be",
          "A short stroll from the busy center of Copenhagen is the historical old fort of Kastellet. I really liked the atmosphere here, calm and dignified. There are rows of barracks and buildings from the 17th and 18th century. The Little Mermaid, one of the iconic sights of",
          "Kastellet is nice to have a walk on the way for example to the little mermaid - it even makes more of the mermaid...",
          "Nice place, great view, very good for running or walking, it wasn't very crowded, Watch out if you're afraid of highs.",
          "Walk through gates that cross the moat beyond the berm that surrounds the castle and see the 17th century long red buildings that have housed the military for centuries. If needed, use the toilets near the north end of the grounds. Exit via the north gate and view the",
          "came upon this site without realising where we were, free to enter and walk the ramparts for views..",
          "A kind of garrison. Not much to see here, but the Little Mermaid statua is nearby. To get here I recommend a tourist bus.",
          "OK, it's actually an old fort, which is mildly interesting to walk through, but the best part is walking (or running) around the ramparts. You can easily fit this in as part of a walk along the harbor to see The Little Mermaid (I agree with the reviewer who called this statue",
          "A very beautiful fortress in Copenhagen. Well worth a visit. It's easy to access and very close to the famous, but tiny, Little Mermaid. The gardens and natural life are amazing! Highly recommended for all family.",
          "This is a large beautifully groomed Historic Fort with grass covered ramparts. It is right on the waterfront and only a few minutes walk from the cruise port or from downtown. It is beautiful and a nice cool quiet place to walk around. We saw that locals use it as a park and",
          "Walked through here on the way to see the mermaid statue (totally boring, but you have to see it, right). Don't miss the wind mill on the west side. As you head back you can stop into the Designmuseum Denmark. Great design museum with tons of furniture. Also a great cafe.",
          "Stumbled into this place by accident, but it turned out to be a lovely spot for an afternoon walk before heading back into the center of the city. It is very taken care of, quiet and relaxing, and lets you see many different sights of Copenhaguen. Takes about an hour to walk the",
          "This coastal structure remains in very good condition these days. Interesting to know and see how the old Danes defended thir home town through the centuries.",
          "For me the sites of Copenhagen were just excuses to do more cycling - for anyone who loves bikes, this city is heaven and I couldn't get enough of it.",
          "Kastellet is located in the northern part of Copenhagen (get off the train at Osterport station) and can be easily included in a visit of the Little Mermaid, St Alban's church and Gefion Springvandet which are all located around Kastellet. It is a plaesant area for a walk, as",
          "A military base that is open to the public.... A quiet cobblestone alleyway with red or yellow painted buildings. On the weekend this looked just like a museum fortress with great views from the ramparts but visiting later in the week caught sight of a patrolling sentry",
          "Spent an hour or so wondering around this area. Felt it would have been better with an information map or guide even some sign posts with the history etc would have been helpful.",
          "We happened upon the Kastellet after visiting the little mermaid statue in the harbor. This historic fort is right nearby but hard to see due to high protective berms built originally to protect the fort. I found the whole area quiet and picturesque and felt like I had gone back",
          "Kastellet has a rich history as part of Copenhagens defence and today it is very much preserved and restored. Quite close to the Little Mermaid lies the starshaped citadell with canons, soldier quaters, mess hall, museum and blackpowder storage. The old mill towering the area",
          "Walked by with my six-year old, and explained to him, yet again, the concept of a motte-and-bailey castle (even though this was probably neither). Interesting place. Have a look if you are on your way to the Little Mermaid, like we were.",
          "There was a calmness about the Kastellet. You could sense the serenity and great for some photos. Taking a slow walk through to the banks was pleasant.",
          "We walked through the fort from the Little Mermaid to the Fountain and enjoyed it. There's still a military presence and it's good to stroll through then up the embankments.",
          "It is a nice place to chill for awhile, take a walk, enjoy the quiet alone or with company. Great spot for shots.",
          "Very pleasant, calm and nice place to visit. Loved the park, which is surrounded by water, you can have nice walks, check the church, which is very close, beautiful fountain, soldiers etc.",
          "Thus is a rather overlooked place worthy of the short time (30 mins) it takes to walk around and enjoy its features and more interesting than the rather overrated nearby \"Little Mermaid\". Easy to get here by walking from central Copenhagen or via the nearby drop off point for",
          "Really enjoyed visiting this area on an early morning walk recently. Great for taking photos too and not far from the Little Mermaid statue on the harbourfront.",
          "If you head towards the Little Mermaid, but break away inland from the crowds on their way to view that quite unremarkable sculpture, you come to the gates of this impressive and still operational army barracks. It's worth walking around the star-shaped fortifications and",
          "It was so much fun walking on top of the green walls! Amazing view of the water and the small church nearby.",

          "The Kastellet is an old fort, now a free-entry star-shaped park right next to \u00d8sterport train station. Great for sunrise and sunset. Saw a lot of locals jogging and exercising here. It's calmer and quieter than most other places in Copenhagen. It's really close to the",
          "This is nothing particularly impressive. However, on a beautiful day with some time to spare a walk along the ramparts was beautiful. In a city with so many things to see this would not be on my list for Days 1-3.",
          "Your in Denmark, ofcourse you want to see a Windmill. Long walk around the pond to get to it though, but worth it all the same. We took our shoes off and just walked barefoot on the grass. The army barracks and lake around it, so beautiful. It's a great place to have a picnic.",
          "A good choice for a break during the visit... much more interesting then little mermaid, so when you are near go inside and climb the ramparts",
          "This is a beautiful and peaceful park located within walking distance of Nyhavn. I will visit this park again.",
          "The architecture is amazing typical Danish colourful buildings. The ramparts are wonderful to walk round but be careful of the joggers as there everywhere- not a problem as it just makes the place more alive. Lots of places to sit and rest. Toilets are clean.",
          "while strolling the parks and taking in a sight every few minutes we saw the windmill in the trees on the bunker in Churchill Park. This is a great place to walk and tour the city near new harbor. The water way makes a lovely walking area and the trees offer shade on a hot day.",

          "It is part military base, part recreational space. Great to walk around and take photos of Copenhagen.",
          "We walked by here on our way back from the Mermaid Statue. We noticed all the birds, which I assume had migrated? Someone had put bird feeders out for them. We loved all the statues, and the greenery.",

          "Beautiful site to walk along the numerous paths, or use bicycle. It was a little bit frisky when we visited, so we didn't spend much time there, but what we saw, the windmill and numerous military buildings were well maintained and nice to see.",
          "Nice place to seat on bench and enjoy ducks swimming in pond! Red long buildings are really red and long! I mean they do look wonderful! Wooden windmill looks amazing!",

          "Kastellet is a star-shaped fort surrounded by a deep, water-filled moat and with very steep ramparts. It has been a Danish defensive site for centuries and even today at its centre it hosts various working military buildings and a parade ground. The setting is very pleasant and",

          "This is a nice and sizeable park that you will likely walk through to get to the Little Mermaid. Good thing it's pretty, because the walk isn't short. It was chilly, as it was April, but we still went back on another, sunnier day to enjoy a picnic by one of the canals.",

          "You can easily spend half an hour walking around the green park like area and look at the old buildings of the former military site. I was looking for a place to sit down and have a drink but could not find one. But the mix of trees and water is still worth spending a bit of",

        "wiki": "Tivoli, also known as Tivoli Gardens, is an amusement park and pleasure garden in Copenhagen, Denmark. The park opened on 15 August 1843 and is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world, after Dyrehavsbakken in nearby Klampenborg, also in Denmark.\nWith 4.6 million visitors in 2017, Tivoli is the second-most popular seasonal theme park in the world after Europa-Park. Tivoli is the fifth-most visited theme park in Europe, behind Disneyland Park, Europa-Park, Walt Disney Studios Park and Efteling. It is located directly in downtown Copenhagen, next to the Central rail station for the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe amusement park was first called \"Tivoli & Vauxhall\"; \"Tivoli\" alluding to the Jardin de Tivoli in Paris (which in its turn had been named after Tivoli near Rome, Italy), and \"Vauxhall\" alluding to Vauxhall Gardens in London. It is mentioned in various books, such as Number the Stars by Lois Lowry, and was also used prominently in the 1961 science fiction film Reptilicus. \nTivoli's founder, Georg Carstensen (b. 1812 \u2013 d. 1857), obtained a five-year charter to create Tivoli by telling King Christian VIII that \"when the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics\". The monarch granted Carstensen use of roughly 15 acres (61,000 m\u00b2) of the fortified glacis outside Vesterport (the West Gate) for an annual rent. Until the 1850s Tivoli was outside the city, accessible from the city only through the Vesterport.\nFrom its beginning Tivoli included a variety of attractions: buildings in the exotic style of an imaginary Orient: a theatre, band stands, restaurants and caf\u00e9s, flower gardens, and mechanical amusement rides such as a merry-go-round and a primitive scenic railway. After dark, colored lamps illuminated the gardens. On certain evenings, specially designed fireworks could be seen reflected in Tivoli's lake, a remnant of the moat surrounding the city fortifications.\nComposer Hans Christian Lumbye (b. 1810 \u2013 d. 1874) was Tivoli's musical director from 1843 to 1872. Lumbye was inspired by Viennese waltz composers such as the Strauss family (Johann Strauss I and his sons), and became known as the \"Strauss of the North\". Many of his compositions are specifically inspired by the gardens, including \"Salute to the Ticket Holders of Tivoli\", \"Carnival Joys\" and \"A Festive Night at Tivoli\". The Tivoli Symphony Orchestra still performs many of his works.\n\nIn 1874, a Chinese-style Pantomimeteatret (pantomime theatre) took the place of an older smaller theatre. The audience stands in the open, the stage being inside the building. The theatre's \"curtain\" is a mechanical peacock's tail. From the very beginning, the theatre was the home of Italian pantomimes, introduced in Denmark by the Italian Giuseppe Casorti. This tradition, dependent on the Italian Commedia dell'Arte, has been kept alive; it portrays the characters Cassander (the old father), Columbine (his beautiful daughter), Harlequin (her lover), and, especially popular with the youngest spectators, the stupid servant Pierrot. The absence of spoken dialogue is an advantage, for Tivoli is now an international tourist attraction.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Tivoli also hosted human exhibitions.In 1943, Nazi sympathisers burnt many of Tivoli's buildings, including the concert hall, to the ground. Temporary buildings were constructed in their place and the park was back in operation after a few weeks.Tivoli is always evolving without abandoning its original charm or traditions. Georg Carstensen said in 1844: \"Tivoli will never, so to speak, be finished\", a sentiment echoed just over a century later when Walt Disney said of his own Tivoli-inspired theme park, \"Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.\"\nIn Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the word tivoli has become synonymous with any amusement park.\n\n\n== Rides ==\n\nThe park is best known for its wooden roller coaster, Rutschebanen, or as some people call it, Bjergbanen (The Mountain Coaster), built in 1914. It is one of the world's oldest wooden roller coasters that is still operating today. An operator controls the ride by braking so that it does not gain too much speed during descent of the hills. It is an ACE Coaster Classic.Another roller coaster, The Demon (D\u00e6monen), features an Immelmann loop, a vertical loop, and a zero-G roll all during the ride time of just one minute and forty six seconds. An old roller coaster, The Snake (Slangen), was removed to have enough space for The Demon. In 2017, Tivoli Gardens added an optional virtual reality experience to the ride, simulating a flight through ancient China, along with encounters with dragons and demons. The Demon is situated next to the concert hall.\nA well-known swing ride, The Star Flyer, opened in Tivoli in 2006. 80 metres (260 feet) high and built by the Austria based Australian company Funtime, it offers panoramic views of the city.On 1 May 2009, Tivoli Gardens opened the new ride Vertigo, a looping plane ride where the rider pilots the ride, able to control the plane.\nA Zamperla Air Race ride, Aquila, opened on 11 April 2013. It is a giant swing and spinner with centrifugal powers up to 4 g, named after the constellation of the Eagle.The newest attraction is Fatamorgana, which opened in 2016. This is the world's first Condor 2GH, which offers two separate seating arrangements, one milder version with two-seater gondolas, and a thrilling version in which riders are slung around at high speed while seated in a ring and facing away from the center.\n\n\n=== Roller coasters ===\n\n\n=== Other rides ===\nAquila - giant swing and spinner ride that opened in 2013; with centrifugal powers up to 4 g; height limit 1,2 m.\nThe Bumper Cars - classic bumper cars that date from 1926.\nFatamorgana - a 43 m (141 ft) tall hybrid Condor ride that opened in 2016.

As indicated by the name, it is primarily a scene for pantomime theatre in the classical Italian commedia dell'arte tradition, which is performed daily with a live pit orchestra. Besides this original function, the theatre leads a second life as a venue for ballet and modern dance, performing works by choreographers such as August Bournonville, Dinna Bj\u00f8rn, Louise Midjord and Paul James Rooney.\n\n\n=== The Tivoli Youth Guard ===\n\nThe Tivoli Youth Guard is a formation of boys and girls aged 8\u201316 dressed in uniforms reminiscent of those of the Royal Danish Guard complete with bearskins.

        "wiki": "Frederiksberg (Danish pronunciation: [f\u0281e\u00f0\u0281eks\u02c8p\u025b\u0250\u032f\u02c0]) is a part of the Capital Region of Denmark. It is formally an independent municipality, Frederiksberg Municipality, separate from Copenhagen Municipality, but both are a part of the City of Copenhagen. It occupies an area of less than 9 km2 and had a population of 103,192 in 2015.Frederiksberg is an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen Municipality. Some sources ambiguously refer to Frederiksberg as a quarter or neighbourhood of Copenhagen, being one of the four municipalities that constitute the City of Copenhagen (the other three being Copenhagen, T\u00e5rnby and Drag\u00f8r). However, Frederiksberg has its own mayor and municipal council, and is fiercely independent.\nFrederiksberg is an affluent area., characterised by its many green spaces, such as the Frederiksberg Gardens, S\u00f8ndermarken, and Hostrups Have. Some institutions and locations that are widely considered to be part of Copenhagen are actually located in Frederiksberg. For example, Copenhagen Zoo as well as several stations of the Copenhagen Metro (the stations Forum, Frederiksberg, Fasanvej, Lindevang, and Flintholm) are located in Frederiksberg. The Copenhagen S-train system also has several stations in Frederiksberg, including Peter Bangs Vej station and Flintholm station.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFrederiksberg's original name was Tuleh\u00f8j (= Thyle-hill), indicating that a thul (= thyle) lived there, the reciter of eldritch times. The term is known from the Snoldelev rune stone. In Beowulf, Unferth holds the same title. In H\u00e5vam\u00e5l, Odin himself is referred to as \"the old thul\". Thula translates as \"song\", like in the Rigsthula poem from the Edda. By 1443 the name Tuleh\u00f8j was spelled Tullesh\u00f8y. It was regarded as Copenhagen's border to the west. People lived here since the Bronze Age.\nThe history of Frederiksberg goes back to 2 June 1651 when King Frederik III gave 20 Danish\u2014Dutch peasants the rights to settle at All\u00e9gade (= all\u00e9 = tree-lined street, gade = street), and founded the town then named \"Ny Amager\" (= New Amager) or \"Ny Holl\u00e6nderby\" (= New Dutchman-town). Farming was not very successful, and in 1697 most of the town burned down. This meant that the peasants were unable to pay taxes, and the land reverted to the crown by Frederik III's son Christian V.\nIn 1700\u20131703, King Frederik IV built a palace on top of the hill known as Valby Bakke (bakke = hill). He named the palace Frederichs Berg, and the rebuilt town at the foot of the hill consequently changed its name to Frederiksberg. A number of the local houses were bought by wealthy citizens of Copenhagen who did not farm the land, but rather used the properties as country houses.\nThe town changed slowly from a farming community to a merchant town, with craftsmen and merchants. During the summer rooms were offered for rent, and restaurants served food to the people of Copenhagen who had left the cramped city for the open land, and to be near the royals.\nInitially the town grew slowly with population growing from 1,000 in 1770, to 1,200 in 1800, and to 3,000 in 1850.\nIn 1852, Parliament removed restrictions which prohibited permanent construction outside Copenhagen's city walls. Almost immediately numerous residential areas were constructed, starting in the eastern part near Copenhagen, and ending in the western part farthest away from Copenhagen in 1950. This led to rapid population growth; in 1900 the population reached 80,000, and in 1950 Frederiksberg peaked with a population of 120,000.\nToday Frederiksberg consists almost entirely of 3- to 5-story residential houses, large single-family homes, and large parks; only a few small areas with light industry remain.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nFrederiksberg, which lies west of central Copenhagen, is completely surrounded by boroughs forming part of the city of Copenhagen \u2013 the result of an expansion of the Copenhagen Municipality's boundary in 1901, which nevertheless did not include Frederiksberg in the list of municipalities to be incorporated in the enlarged area. Frederiksberg is thus effectively a municipal island within the country's capital \u2013 a unique phenomenon in present-day Europe. Other than administratively, however, it is largely indistinguishable in character from the districts of Copenhagen city which surround it.Frederiksberg has several stations on the Copenhagen Metro system, and is home to the tallest residential structure in Denmark and the second tallest residential building in Scandinavia: the 102-metre high Domus Vista.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe Danmark Rundt cycling race traditionally finishes on Frederiksberg Alle, often in a sprint finish.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nFrederiksberg houses the University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus, Copenhagen Business School, 9 public schools (run by the municipality), 3 private schools, 1 technical college, and more.\nThe Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Prins Henrik, a French international school, is in Frederiksberg.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe 3 streets Gammel Kongevej, Godth\u00e5bsvej, and Falkoner Alle are the busiest shopping streets. The town also houses the Frederiksberg Centret shopping mall.\n\n\n=== Main sights ===\nFrederiksberg Campus (University of Copenhagen)\nFrederiksberg Gardens\nFrederiksberg Hospital\nFrederiksberg Palace\nFrederiksberg Town Hall\nCopenhagen Business School\nCopenhagen Zoo\nRoyal Danish Military Academy\n\n\n== Demography ==\nPopulation of Frederiksberg (from 1769):",

        "wiki": "Langelinie (English: Long Line) is a pier, promenade and park in central Copenhagen, Denmark, and home of The Little Mermaid statue. The area has for centuries been a popular destination for excursions and strolls in Copenhagen. Most cruise ships arriving in Copenhagen also berth at Langelinie Pier.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Military area and the first promenade ===\n\nThe name Langelinie goes back to the middle of the 17th century where it referred to an idyllic path along the \u00d8resund coast that rounded the citadel Kastellet and continued towards a lime kiln north of the city. For a long time, the stretch was a military area where civilians were not granted unrestricted access. Under a general order from 1819, soldiers were required to \"throw water in the head and on the breast and to cool their feet in the water\".Eventually a beach promenade and a park for the Bourgeoisie were made but with access only on the payment of a toll to keep the more common people out. Not until a public uprising in 1848 did the area become open to everybody.\n\n\n=== Port area and the second promenade ===\nThe expansion of the city and the increasing industrialization soon made it clear that the city's harbour was becoming too small and in the same time old plans to create a free port were revived. In a plan from 1862 it was decided to dig out the area to allow access for the largest ocean-going vessels and use the materials removed for land fills along the coast. A suggestion to make all of Amager into a duty-free zone was abolished and instead it was decided to create a free port in the area north of Kastellet at the site of the Langelinie promenade. The beginning of the work was prompted by  Germany's construction of the Kiel Canal that was begun in 1887 and threatened Copenhagen's position. In 1894 the work was completed and Copenhagen had got an entirely new harbourfront. The old beach promenade with Bourgeois mansions had turned into the heavily trafficated street Strandboullevarden located several hundred metres inland and the beach where the soldiers had been required to cool their feet had turned into harbour basins. Langelinie became now a pier on the other side of that harbour basin.\n\n\n== Langelinie Park ==\nThe Langelinie Park (Danish: Langelinieparken) stretches from Esplanaden in the south to Langelinie Marina and the base of the Langelinie Pier in the north. Formally, it includes Kastellet although this site is generally referred to under its own name. The park contains numerous monuments, buildings, a marina, statues and a playground. Among these are the Gefion Fountain, the Ivar Huitfeldt Column and The Little Mermaid.\n\n\n== Langelinie Marina ==\n\nLangelinie Marina was established in the 1890s in connection with the foundation of the Free Port and the Langelinie Quat. Its purpose was to provide the  workers from the construction site as well as those from the Burmeister & Wain shipyard on the other side of the harbour with a chance to have a small boat, enabling them to supplement their incomes with a bit of fishing.Copenhagen rowing clubs have for many years had their base at the marina. Today only B&Ws and DFDS' are left after \u00d8K's passed their premises to Langelinie Marina's Boat Huild.\n\n\n== Langelinie Pier ==\n\nThe Langelinie Pier (Danish: Langeliniekajen) has a water depth allowing big ocean-going vessels to tie up. The area has a number of statues and memorials. These include a cast bronze sculpture polar bear with cubs and memorials for MS Jutlandia, Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen. The polar bear has some bullet holes at the head, which were made by a German soldier under the Occupation of Denmark.\n\n\n== Langelinie Pavilion ==\nThe Langelinie Pavilion was designed by Nils and Rva Koppel. It is the third building of the name at the site.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLangelinie Marina Boat Club",

          "It was dry during the time I visited. Looked fine, nothing specially outstanding.",
          "The little mermaid was the best attractions. It's a long walk besides the beach a wonderful place and it is peaceful. Being alone walking in the langlinie is the best choice. Not good for people who can't walk",
          "Calm place with dashing waters. The statue is nicely placed close enough to get beautiful pictures :) the mini dockyard is quite cute too!! The big smoke emitting chimneys however are quite a photobombers :(",
          "Nice promenade, also to bike past. With the little mermaid statue (especially over there you'll see many tourists), views of Copenhagen and a beautiful fountain. Can imagine its even more beautiful in the afternoon",
          "Worth going to see if your a fan of the fairytale, easy to find in the park follow the crowd's",
          "The cherry trees are almost more worth to look at than the mermaid. You should feel lucky if you can get a proper look at her for all the other visitors",
          "A little smaller than I imagined, but still pretty",
          "The Mermaid Point in Copenhagen, Denmark. One of the main tourist attractions during the City Tour Hop-on-Hop-off. Surrounded with beautiful parks and several ice parlours.",
          "Looks cool, no water in the fountain in January. Not sure why, possibly working on it or to stop the pipes freezing.",
          "Little mermaid ..famous place in Copenhagen to take Good pics and spend some time.",
          "Nice statue, nice photos, lovely views",
          "I've visited the place with the Free Tour - the area is very nice to walk.",
          "Beautiful. From this place you are in a short distance from seeing a lot of good stuff, that are to be found in Copenhagen.\n\nThe little Mermaid is to be found here, with a lot of tourists that are taking pictures with her.\nYou have a lovely garden, Kastellet and some restaurants near the dock, when you want to relax.",
          "This is the original little mermaid dont be fooled!",
          "This place is totally worth the walk! It's serene and beautiful!",
          "Highly overrated place to visit in Copenhagen. Sculpture and story lying behind it is nice, but it's located quite far away from city center and if you have 1 day here it doesn't make much sense to walk here.",
          "I jumped off a Hop On - Hop Off tour bus to visit this location. I was hunting for some Copenhagen souvenirs and there were many shops for shopping. The bus stopping at this location was very convenient before returning to Copenhagen center city. It was a good experience.",
          "Beautiful sculpture! She is never lonely with so many visitors daily. The skyline and windmills can be seen in the background and the sunset makes it a beautiful postcard moment.",
          "First impressions are this is a place to receive culture and style, the atmosphere is a story itself and clean and healthy living seems to be an in word.\nIt is expensive as you might expect, the shops are exclusive and many offer unique products all design made.",
          "Worth the visit. It's a delightful stroll to find the mermaid and so peaceful.",
          "Wow so colorful and amazing just a 2 minutes walking distance from metro",
          "It was really crowded when i went there but it was a great experience. We only took a few photos there as the hop-on hop-off sightseeing bus only stopped there for 5 minutes. Honestly feel that it is indeed a overrated tourist attraction as there are many better places to visit. But if you do have the time, do drop by there!",
          "It was a beautiful sunlit after noon with a large and varied crowd around the little mermaid statue. Watching people pose for photos is as interesting as the statue itself. The canal in the background shone in the late afternoon light. Also \u2026",
          "Another one day stop over really nice place to visit",
          "Nice to visit and learn about all the different aspects there.",
          "I love walking here. So many picture worthy statues and views.",
          "This is where you go to see the Little Mermaid. But, the place also has other things to see. A weird perspective on the harbour of Copenhagen, on your way out you get to see the Opera as well. There is a park with loads of statues and \u2026",

          "It is the place to see in Copenhagen. However, we were quite disappointed with the mermaid statue itself. I know there are lots of stories behind it but the statue somehow lacked the wow factor. Other than that the surroundings are fantastic. A great place to take a stroll and spend an afternoon.",
          "The famous little mermaid. Crowded with tourists but nice to visit. The park nearby is quite nice",
          "Just a 5 minute walk from the infamous Little Mermaid - this is a really beautiful (and sizeable) fountain!",
          "Nice area for walking around,  If you are lucky, you can get a photo with a statue of yourself without all the other tourists.  But the garden around is quite nice.",
          "Absolutely amazing. Found it randomly and we loved it",
          "Beautiful area. Perfect for nice strolls along the little hills",
          "A few so called Outlet Shops \"hidden\" in the pier for cruising ships in Copenhagen. Not really worth the detour although close to the Little Mermaid",
          "Weekens fun begins from here with fun nd beer... Just go and enjoy the cheerful place",
          "A nice fountain place. Place to get a lot of pics n selfies",

          "Amazing place \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Looks nice when there isn't a swarm of people around it... Probably better to see it online in a picture instead",
          "Nice for evening stroll and open air casual dining with the locals. Not a tourist in site despite it being on the way to the little mermaid... The day tourists are probably eating in a tourist trap somewhere else.",
          "Honestly I was underwhelmed. I understand the story of the mermaid becoming human and it is a pretty sculpture however it is small and surrounded by a crowd of tourists taking selfies making it hard to see or admire. It is free though and \u2026",
          "The air is so fresh and the scene is amazing",
          "Nice spirit and Greta Danish heling people",
          "Nice and popular pier with the Little mermaid statue",
          "It's a nice statue and has a good back story but both times I visited throughout the day it was being rather clumsily being stood upon by tourists (I visited it at 5am and 5pm). It kind of ruined the experience.",
          "Nice piece of history to walk around in and watch.",
          "Nice monument/ fountain near little mermaid, nice walk back to city centre",
          "Always a beautiful experience when the Japanese cherry trees are blossoming.",

          "What can you say more about The Little Mermaid statue?! Worth a visit to see it and the water, but expect that there always be lots of people, because it\u2019s famous. Easy to visit from Bus and subway and on foot.",
          "Lovely peaceful place... To visit!",
          "The area is very scenic with a fantastic view of the blue harbour. There are also many restaurants which offer good menus. There is a park nearby which makes the place good for a family visit with children.",
          "If your hoping for a big statue you better think twice. Little Mermaid is, as the name says, quite small. Probably, human size. But is a must! The walk 'til there is amazing and if your a fan of the story you sure will enjoy it. I know I did.",
          "Very good place for walk around. You can see lots of things by walk of 2 kms. Keep talking and keep enjoying. Don't forget to walk with harbour side.",
          "This was a fantastical stop. To hear the stories behind the stories. One of a kind experience that will stay with you forever. Such a fun place.",
          "mermaid looks like she needs a vacation in canaries",
          "Totally worth the walk if you want to visit the nearby palace and fortress (hint: you do want to do these things!).  Amazing view of the town and harbor from the fortress nearby.  Give yourself about 2 hours here.  We went when it was cold and still really enjoyed ourselves.  Can't imagine how busy this place is during the summer!",
          "Quite a picturesque spot. We can easily spend about 1 hour taking photographs by the pier, mermaid and at the parks.  We enjoyed the breathtaking views with a cup of coffee.",
          "Did walking tour of city. Little Mermaid smaller than imagined and very busy there. Watch out for bicycles: they have priority and don't take prisoners! City very clean and airy, with lovely green spaces.",
          "Fantastic experience watching the changing of the guards.",
          "We finally got to see the little mermaid, it wasn't all that unfortunately. However, it seems to be a big attraction to the Asian community. We enjoyed Copenhagen very much it's a beautiful city and wonderful people.",
          "It\u2019s really crowded by tourists, the mermaid is small and you don\u2019t really see her. Nice to see because it\u2019s famous but nothing really special!",
          "Beautiful place to walk along the pier with possibility to catch an ice cream on the way. but don't go there only to see the little mermaid then you will be disappointed. After all it's only a statue beautiful yes. But not something to look at for hours.",
          "Great place to hang out.",
          "Near to little mermaid\nSimple place to visit and take photos",
          "We were there in November was a bit of disappointment. Not much to see i believe a summer walk would be nice but if you miss it. Its not much of experience you losing.  One public toliet with a long que waiting for you. So make sure you pee before you go",
          "It is one of the most overrated attractions in the world. It is small regular statue. Though the walk by the water from Copenhagen city center is really nice. And each time I'm in Copenhagen, I walk there because of the beauty of Copenhagen, not little mermaid itself.",
          "It is so beautiful in a sunny days",
          "Impressive, would have been great to see it working.",
          "Visiting it was a little overrated... There is ALWAYS a lot of tourists there, so if you don't like crowds... Best you do a canal tour and see it from the other size, it's more informative and less crowded.",
          "It is nice to walk around in this park. I was lucky when visited this park, it was spring with a nice weather. There's a many statue around here, also some cherry blossom tree! You can find a  food stalls around Mermaid statue.",
          "A nice destination on a walk through the city.",
          "Nice place but around 45 minutes walking from city center, but you can't leave Copenhagen without visiting.",
          "Interesting place and story behind it.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Little mermaid is along the river bank. Walk past it towards the Centers with its colourful houses and restaurants. Very clean city. Best time is spring before the tourist rush in July-August",
          "The Mermaid in Denmark is little but the journey to see her is ultra-amazing. Not too crowded and you can go by boat or take a tour bus. Loved Copenhagen.",
          "Not sure why people complain about the size of the Little Mermaid statue, it's approximately life size (slightly smaller, but she was only 16 if I remember correctly) and that makes sense to me.",
          "Nice statue on a rock. Copenhagen is full of sculpture, and to be brutal, I don't see why this one is anything special. But if you're visiting the citadel nearby, wander down to the coast and make your own mind up.",
          "It's a beautiful area with a nice mix of culture and nature. Something Denmark does really well!",
          "If you want to take a nice and relaxing walk in Copenhagen, this is the place to be, especially in the Spring where all the cherry blossoms and other flowers are in full bloom. It is located near the pier and also near the statue of the \u2026",
          "Good but make sure you don\u2019t go in afternoon then it\u2019s too crowded to take a picture with statue!",
          "Beautiful place to have had the privilege of visiting. Also a great place to sit, reflect and grab a bit to eat by the bar/restaurant.",
          "Beautiful place to walk around",
          "Smaller than I expected but a nice visit and with a lot of history to tell without any word.",
          "I recommend to walk all the way up there, you can see many interesting buildings on your way or just admire the harbor view. Although it's a super crowded around the Little Mermaid, I guess it's worth it to go and see it once as it is part of the Danish culture.",
          "Easy to miss due to its small size, but beautifully simple, elegant and straight out of a fairy tail..",
          "I had to visit the famous mermaid of Copenhagen, but this is extremely crowded during normal ours. I'd recommend going either really early in the morning or late at night.",
          "really nice :D a lot to see. sadly a lot of tourists around the mermaid",

          "I enjoy the morning walk to this small church with a big signboard WELCOME VISITORS and is free entrance. Very peaceful area.\nOutside the church, nice landscapes and a short walking distance to Little Mermaid.",
          "The symbol of Denmark and especially Copenhagen of course. Once you discover the siren you realize that it's smaller than expected and you'll have to fight with Chinese tourists to get a beautiful picture of her. Good luck.",
          "Historical, beautiful and truly fantastic Copenhagen.",
          "It's a good place to visit. No matter the season, weather. Many other places to visit are nearby too.",
          "It's one of the must do things if you are visiting Copenhagen. It is a bit of a way out of the centre but you can get there on some of the local buses or the river bus. While there the St Alban's church is well worth a look too.",
          "Loved the little mermaid, but you should visit early because there are so many people",
          "It's a pier. Not more, no less. But you get a nice view at the opera house.",
          "It has some stores and a cafeteria, around the corner is the little mermaid and another monument. I'd say the little mermaid must be my least favourite attraction in Copenhagen. Langelinie at least has a great view to the water.",
          "it was a raining summer day . but a must see monument.",
          "The iconic walk of Copenhagen, with the little Mermaid. Love the bulls statue more actually. See it with the sunset behind though...",

          "You can walk to the Mermaid from here.",

          "Beautiful walk if you\u2019re a little mermaid fan. If not, you\u2019re not missing out on too much. Can get crowded with tourists and is a little out of the way but is a great walk if it\u2019s a nice day out!",
          "It have been upgraded and the shops are a bit better but all in al not a pier to visit for its own sake... it\u2019s not a destination in itself",

          "nice place, it s a must for visitors in copenhagen.",

          "Within walking distance of several other nearby points of interest. This one is interesting to see. The mermaid is much smaller than I anticipated it would be. One of the must see land marks.",

There are always plenty of things to look at and many tempting places for a break. Don't forget to pass Amalie Haven or a quick detour to see if the queen is home",

          "The little mermaid statue is a landmark you dont want to miss. It is rather small and unassuming. The pier itself is teeming with people and beautiful views across the water",
          "great place except that it is very windy here, so better go there prepared with some nice warm jacket and caps. beautiful and scenic all around.",
          "Although the statue itself isn't the most epic thing you'll ever see, the walk along the water and trough the park was very nice.",
          "Nice. I recommend going there when it's raining, so you can enjoy the Little Marmaid instead of tonnes of turists.",
          "It's a nice spot, a very touristy location, but in my opinion it's a bit boring. There's not much to do, other than take a few photos and selfies, and it's always very crowded, you can't get a picture of just yourself and the mermaid",
          "Nice walk along the river on way to little mermaid.",

          "Ideal cruise stop right next to a row of decent shops.",
          "An iconic view for Copenhagen. A must see. It's a smallish statue by the waters of the river, away from the city. Perched on some rocks, you can approach it and get close to it to have your pictures taken. You and the many tourists who have \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Church of Our Saviour (Danish: Vor Frelsers Kirke; [v\u0252 \u02c8f\u0281\u00e6ls\u0250s \u02c8ki\u0250\u032fk\u0259]) is a baroque church in Copenhagen, Denmark, most famous for its helix spire with an external winding staircase that can be climbed to the top, offering extensive views over central Copenhagen. It is also noted for its carillon, which is the largest in northern Europe and plays melodies every hour from 8 am to midnight.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen Christian IV planned Christianshavn in 1617, it was intended as an independent merchant's town on the island of Amager and it therefore needed a church. A temporary church was inaugurated in 1639 but construction of the present Church of Our Saviour, the design of Lambert van Haven, did not start until 1682. The church was inaugurated 14 years later in 1695 but important interior features like the altar had a notoriously temporary character and the tower still had no spire. The church got its permanent altar in 1732 but plans for construction of the spire was not revitalized until 1747 under the reign of Frederik V. The new architect on the project was Lauritz de Thurah. He soon abandoned van Haven's original design in favour of his own project that was approved by the King in 1749. Three years later the spire was finished and the King climbed the tower at a ceremony on 28 August 1752.\n\n\n=== Urban legend ===\nThere is a long-lived urban legend stating that the architect killed himself by jumping from the top of the spire, when he realised that the spiral turns the wrong way - anticlockwise -  around. This is not about Lambert van Haven, since the spire was added to the church almost 50 years after his death, but the designer of the spiral spire, Laurids de Thurah. There is no truth in the myth though, since Thurah died in his bed seven years after the spire was completed, and there is nothing in the records that indicates that he should have been unhappy with his work in any way.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church is built in a Dutch baroque style and its basic layout is a Greek cross. The walls rest on a granite foundation and are made of red and yellow tiles but in a random pattern unlike what is seen in Christian IV's buildings where they are generally systematically arranged. The facade is segmented by pilasters in the palladian giant order, that is they continue in the building's entire height. The pilasters are of the Tuscan order with bases and capitals in sandstone. The cornice is also in sandstone but with a frieze in tiles. Between the pilasters are tall round-arched windows with clear glass and iron cames. There are entrances at the gable of the cross arms except for the eastern gable where the sacristy is added. The main entrance is in the western gable below the tower and has a sandstone portal. All entrances are raised four steps from street level. At each side of the tower, there is a gate at street level leading to the two crypts of the church. The roof is vaulted and covered in black-glazed tiles.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\n\n=== Tessin's altarpiece ===\n\nThe altarpiece is the work of Nicodemus Tessin and is considered a masterpiece. It depicts a scene from the Garden of Gethsemane between two columns, where Jesus is comforted by an angel while another angel hangs in the air beside them, carrying the golden chalice. On each side, two figures of Pietas and Justitia illustrate the King's motto. The two columns carry a broken, curved architrave and gable. Behind the opening of the broken gable is placed a pane with Jahve's name in Hebrew inscribed and lit from behind. Around the pane is an arrangement of gilded beans and cloud formations.\n\n\n=== Organ ===\nThe huge organ with Christian V\u2019s gilded monogram was built by the Botzen Brothers from 1698-1700 and is mounted on the wall and supported by two elephants. The organ has more than 4000 pipes with the original cymbelstern tinkling in the background during a special part of a music piece, and the entire instrument produces the sound that was heard in the church over 300 years ago. The church arranges 15-20 concerts every year together with musical church services on Sundays. The last rebuilding of the organ was in 1965, reusing older pipe work and this instrument is equipped with 57 stops spread over 4 manuals and pedals. The facade of the organ has intricate wood carvings and a bust of Christian V in the centre.\n\n\n== Tower ==\nThe tower is raised three stories above the western cross arm. The levels are marked by sandstone cornices that become larger with height, and there are round-arched openings on all four sides at each level. The top level is decorated with flat pilasters and from the uppermost cornice has a gilded penetrated clock face centrally on each side. The hands are connected to a clockwork inside the tower.\n\n\n=== Spire ===\nThe black and golden spire reaches a height of 90 metres and the external staircase turns four times counterclockwise around it. Inspiration for the design came from the spiral lantern of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza, which turns the same way around.\nIt is built as a timber-framed structure, octagonal at its base, with round-arched openings and round windows with gilded frames. The windows are flanked by gilded pilasters in the composite order. Around the octagonal base of the spire on the four corners of the square tower, stand four statues of the four evangelists. The octagonal structure is topped by a small platform with a gilded railing and it is from this point that the staircase become external. There is a total number of 400 steps to the top of the spire, the last 150 being outside.\nThe spire is topped by a vase-like structure, carrying a gilded globe with a 4-meter-tall figure of Christ Triumphant carrying a banner. It has an infamous reputation for being the ugliest sculpture in Copenhagen but is intentionally made with exaggerated proportions because it is only meant to be seen from long distances.\n\n\n=== Views ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Carillon ===\nThe tower of the church is equipped with a concert carillon from 1928 that was rebuilt in 1980 and consists of 48 bronze carillon bells that have a musical range of four octaves, making it the largest carillon in Northern Europe. The largest bells weigh over 2,000 kilograms and the smallest 10 kilograms. In total, the carillon weighs almost 12 tonnes, and chimes every hour over Christianshavn with different hymn compositions. The church established the first full-time carillon performance position in Denmark in 1983, and carillonneur Ulla Laage held the position until 2006.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\nThe grounds of the church are surrounded by a fence and contains the remains of the church's graveyard. The current of Our Saviour's Cemetery is located at the corner of Amagerbrogade and Prags Boulevard on Amager, It was inaugurated in 1790.\n\n\n=== Burials ===\nBurials at the church include:\n\nAndreas Bj\u00f8rn (1703\u20131750), merchant, shipowner and ship builder\nOtto Fabricius (1744\u20131822), missionary, naturalist, ethnographer and explorer\nFrederik Holmsted  (1683\u20131758), merchant and mayor of Copenhagen\nCarl Viborg (1783\u20131844), veterinarian\n\n\n== Cultural connections ==\nThe Church of Our Saviour in Christianshavn appears in a chapter of Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth. The character Axel is made to climb the winding spire for five consecutive days by his uncle to cure him of his Acrophobia before their descent into the volcano.The French painter and illustrator \u00c9douard Riou has depicted the church in the original French illustrated version of A Journey to the Center of the Earth, but has the spire turned the wrong way around, that is, clockwise instead of counterclockwise.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVor Frelsers Kirke official website\nVor Frelsers Kirke map",

          "We arrived in Copenhagen on 14/3/20 for a short city break to learn that the whole city was in lock down due to the Corona Virus. Great timing eh. The one thing I really wanted to do was climb the spiral tower of this church, but sadly like all public areas the church was",
          "You need to have a good head for heights to get right to the top of the external spiral staircase t apparently it's well worth the effort. If you are not too confident then just getting to the first level provides good views. Some steep steps inside and some very intersting",
          "This place is amazing to visit, it is so nice inside. However, it\u2019s not for those who are afraid of heights as it is steep...however, my other half said the view was amazing so I took her word for it",
          "Perfect refuge if you\u2019re on foot between Christianshavn and Slotsholmen. The wood carving surrounding the organ pipes is intricate and magnificent. The external spiral staircase winding around the tower is closed during the winter months.",
          "We visited late afternoon (an hour before it closes) as we were in the area on a Monday. The entrance to the outdoor spire was via a side entrance. We had previously activated our Copenhagen Card so this was free for us, otherwise tickets can be purchased just before climbing",
          "Pleasant period typical church, organ playing on our arrival (not for us), some nice marble work as well, but nothing to really go off the beaten track for, unless you want to say a prayer of thanks that you survived Christiana Town visit (Just 200m away) on the way",
          "Really cool views of the city from the top of the tower. Cool climb up as well... the stairs get extremely narrow at the top. Definitely check the schedule before going - they are not open too many hours a week. Also, only go on a nice day - the tower closes in inclement",
          "An exhilerating climb to the top of this churches spire is a highlight of any trip to Copenhagen. It is not a hard climb but the spiral staircase at the top is magnificent. The views over the city are splendid.",
          "The walking path to the top is very nice with all the wood and historical decor surrounding. Sure the view at the viewing deck is amazing! But is you're not afraid of height, definitely a challenge and worth to walk over those 150 steps spiraling at the top of the church! The",
          "It was closed when I went, but the outside is beautiful! Worth the walk to see the spire (if that\u2019s the correct word for it)",
          "The top offers stunning views of Copenhagen, it\u2019s quite cool - at one point it\u2019s more like a ladder than steps but that\u2019s only a short portion. Free with Copenhagen card.",
          "Saw church in distance from open top bus. Decided to climb it the day we went to Christiania. Nice church inside. Lively church to climb and look out over the city. Can make u feel a bit whoosh at the top as it just climbs to a stop and u just turn and go back down. But few",
          "From the outside the tower looks interesting. You can climb right up to the top where the stairs get too narrow to go further. It\u2019s very windy but great views. Allow plenty of time to go to the top. If you\u2019re a doctor who fan you might be creeped out by the random broken statues",

          "Wasn't planning this specifically, but with local friends wandering back from a night time wander to Christiania and spotted it and was told you could walk around the outside of the spire - so made a beeline there the next day. A fairly cheap attraction 35dkk I think. Enter",
          "What a tower! It's a long way to the top but it definitely worth it! The entrance fee was around 25-30 DKK (3-4 \u20ac). You have to be carefull though while climbing because from some point you climb on the outside of the tower. That's why the tower is closed when the weather is",
          "The views are out of this world with the climb which is the highest point in Copenhagen the church tower is fantastic something we have never seen before this is one visit the visitors holiday makers worth the visit we had a great time",
          "Highest point in Copenhagen, a comprehensive view of the city. The top spot is scary as heck as there isn\u2019t much space to stand and it\u2019s worst when the wind blows. Definitely recommend if you are not afraid of height and small space. Tips: \u2022 refill your energy with a chocolate",

          "Unlike most churches, you are not encouraged to visit the interior of this church. The attraction is the bell tower and the spectacular spiral spire (say that three times fast) that can be seen from most of the city. Ifirst saw it from one of the canal boat tours and made a",

          "We have never felt more unwanted in a church anywhere. The people tending the door were rude to us and laughing after we told them it was our third trip there in three days and was told for the third time we could not go in. This church does not like anyone but locals coming",
          "An absolutely amazing building! Unique I'd say. Worth the effort if you can do do it totally .Be warned though, it's a tough climb.",

It was a lot for me but I did it and I\u2019m 31 and I\u2019m fairly good shape! So worth the view. Wouldn\u2019t recommend for larger people or elders or those with knee",

          "This was a completely different experience! For a small fee, we were allowed to climb into the rafters of this church, past the dust-laden attics and no-longer-used gargoyles and angels, and alight outside to climb a spiral staircase to the tippy top of the church steeple for a",

          "The opening hours stated on their website is for the tower itself which you have to pay a fee to enter (or use the copenhagen card like i did). For the church, they have shorter opening hours from 11 to 3.30 pm and i was unable to see this as it was 3.30pm by the time i finished",

It\u2019s a very very long climb and quite claustrophobic at times. Once out of the inner tower you get great views but",
          "Well worth climbing the 300 steps for the amazing views of the city all around Definitely not a handicap adventure They say at times the winds or rain will close it down but we were lucky",
          "First we didn't go up the top as there was a long queue and it was more expensive than the round tower which we had already been up so thought we would get a similar view anyway. However if the queue is long or you don't like heights go inside and look at the beautiful church.",
          "If you love a view and a bit of a thrill, this is the place to go. It was very windy up top and I have to admit, I couldn\u2019t go all the way on the spire but many of my family members did. If heights are not your thing, then this is probably not for you. But if you think you can",
          "This was one of the first things we did in Copenhagen, and loved seeing the view of this beautiful city from so high up! The walk up is a little scary at times- the outer steps are metal and a little slippery, and it\u2019s quite a climb, but totally worth it at the top, for the",

          "This is a very interesting tower to visit, having a fair portion of it outside. There are over 300 steps and some of them are quite steep, so those of a nervous disposition might want to go elsewhere. Give the Route is narrow it can get quite slow, so be prepared to allow",

          "At 50 DKK per person, entrance to the spire is quite steep. But it is well worth it. Not only do you generally have a nice view over the city from here. The walk up the spiral staircase to the spire is a thrilling experience.",
          "This building is worth seeing the tower is beautiful you can go up to the top at a charge however we were happy to admire the building from the outside. If you ventured up you will get an amazing view over Copenhagen.",
          "Come early and in clear weather. Climb the narrow wooden stairs indoor and finish outside with a breathtaking 360 view at the narrowest balcony up high. See most of Copenhagen and lots of northern Zeeland. Turn around and see the bridge and all the way to Sweden. When safely",
          "A very beautiful, bright building, and probably one of the morr interesting pieces of church architecture I have seen.",
          "For 50 dk you can Climb the 400 steps up and then down again to view Copenhagen from above. It is mainly a nice view, certainly Not worth to staand in line for a long time. The climb up and down is on the same stairs, narrow So you will have to make room for people going up or",
          "Didn't get inside. Had a look from the boat trip, as well as on the way to Christiana's. The helix spire staircase add to a great view.",
          "Danish ecclesiastical architecture - basically, big piles of grimy brick with copper roofing - is dull but must be to someone's taste - otherwise, why so much of it - unless drear is some form of collective self-mortification. This, however, is a distinct presence on the inner",
          "A really grand church, with a superbly carved organ. We didn't go up the spire, partly because the line was so long. Plenty of people drop in on their way to Christiania",
          "Exhilarating climb up steep steps. Not for the faint hearted - something like 400 steps, half inside with very steep ladder like steps, the other half outside and winding around the steeple. These are probably slippery when wet. So I suggest avoiding when wet and windy. But for",
          "I enjoy visiting churches due to the exterior and interior architecture. But here, my draw was walking up the outer steeple. Yes, the interior was very pretty (especially the organ pipes), but the thrill of walking up a steeple on the OUTSIDE was just wonderful. You get a",
          "Unique and interesting church with a trademark spire. We attempted to walk up to the top, but half of our party bailed out half-way up! If you're claustrophobic or afraid of heights, just admire it from the ground.",
          "A bit of a wait to get in and then a long climb. I counted, it is more than 400 steps. The space is very narrow and in some places quite steep. You will also meet people going the other way. Remember this if you are not in good physical shape and / or require a lot of space.",
          "Very nice experience climbing up the very narrow stairs all the way to the top. You can feel the tower slightly waving in the wind. Place worth visiting with cheap entry 50DKK.",
          "The walk up the stairs can be nice if you do not have to stop on your way up so people walk down, as only one person can pass at a time when you are three quarters of the way up. Once up there, the view is nice.",
          "We were lucky with the weather and got amazing views of Copenhagen from the top. A great way to conquer your fear of heights and totally worth it.",
          "Well worth a visit. If you have the energy walk up the spire. The views are worth it but really all you can see is flat countryside.",
          "Interior is more beautiful than expected featuring a remarkable wood carved organ pipes. Beware: walk up spire is not open if windy or rainy.",
          "Beautiful and historical architect and peace full place to sit down. Church is in the center near the other attractions.",
          "going up at the tower is some scaring but worth it when you get out and continue to the top. you should plan at least half an hour and visit the interior of the church as well",
          "The walk outside on the spire is breathtaking. And... Truly scary. Not for the faint at heart but the view of the city is a great award.",
          "Tower is full of various artefacts including old bell mechanism and the ringing bells - each floor you climb has more to offer. Then its through the tiny door and you are on the outside of the tower. The balcony isn't big - but there is room to pass and get a good view. Then",
          "Interesting fact about this church is that the tower was added at a much later stage and designed by a different architect,therefor the difference in architecture.",
          "Beatiful spiral tower attracts all to this beautiful church. There was a big queque to go up hence we skipped that. Only had a view from inside. Very close to freetown Christina.",
          "We did not go inside but viewed from the land and from a canal. It is stunning and although not as tall as the Round tower, the views of the canals and the Harbour must be excellent.",
          "For a reasonable price, you walk up the stairs to the top of the church tower. Most of the stairs are inside, but then they go outside, giving you an amazing 360 degree view of the city.",
          "I was recently on vacation in Copenhagen and decided to climb the spire of Our Savior's Church. I love looking at city views from high vantage points, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Chrysler Building in New York City. But this was a more difficult climb than I",
          "A unique church tower in Copenhagen, and built in the 18th century before modern calculation tools. For those nervous of heights, about half the climb is inside the wooden tower and so you emerge outside on the ever-narrowing spiral when about half way up. The views are fine",
          "Go and climb al those steps.. 50 DKK to clump to the top. Worth it to get a good idea of Copenhagen. Informative video if the history of the church. From there go to Christiania just down the road",
          "My wife and I love to get up high when visiting a new city - it\u2019s a great way to get a lay of the land and is typically a great photo. However, no offense but Copenhagen\u2019s skyline is not awesome and the stairs are a one way street on the second half- so when it\u2019s crowded people",
          "Prepare yourself for a steep climb inside and outside! On reaching what I thought was the top of the spire - you then venture outside to climb more steps, in a helter skelter form, on the outside of the building! Great views of the city but a scary climb up and descent down!",
          "Located close to Christiania, the Church of Our Savior offers baroque architecture and a great view of the city. The church features a spiral staircase on the outside which you can climb all the way to the top. There was a long line to climb the stairs however you get to pass",
          "While there are a number of vantage points in the city of Copenhagen, I would strongly advise those who are looking for one to trump the rest to venture to come here. The whole experience of climbing to the top makes the view even more spectacular. The winding stairs on the",
          "This church was interesting, with some information on the way up while still inside the structure. Then, when you emerge outside to go around the top of the steeple, the view of Copenhagen is wonderful. The stairs eventually get narrower and narrower until there aren't stairs",
          "Climbing to the top of the church's tower was my favorite part of visiting Copenhagen. Although it gets nerve wracking towards the top, the views are unbelievable and unlike anywhere else in the city. There is an observatory deck or you can climb further to where you can",
          "Our Saviour\u2019s Church is a striking building with its brown exterior trimmed in gold. Particularly beautiful on a nice day against a blue sky. Very prominent on the exterior is the staircase wrapping its way around the exterior to the top. Climbing to the top is a unique",
          "A great view from the top of Copenhagen and a great place to visit. The church had some great stained glass artwork inside.",
          "If you have a spare 45 minutes or so put this on your CPH list. For 50 DKK for adults and 40 for students this is a fairly cheap attraction for Copenhagen. The climb up is relatively easy so long as you are in decent shape and have good balance. The view from the top is",
          "I don't have a head for heights but decided to climb the tower anyway cos I'm an idiot. The staircases are quite narrow, so sometimes have to spend a bit of time waiting for people to pass by the other way, and one steep ladder near the top before you get outside. Once you get",
          "Our Saviour's is one of Denmark's most famous churches. Ever since the serpentine spire was inaugurated in 1752, is has been a popular passtime to climb the 400 steps to the top.",
          "This is a great place to get a view of the city. It is an easy stop if you are strolling through Christiania. Compared to some other church steeple ascents I would say this one is not too rigorous. On the other hand because of the railing and tight stairway it definitely made me",
          "The church was really beautiful, but the best part was the view from the top of the tower. It's not free of charge (for who doesn't have the Copenhagen Card), but the view is worth it. You may face a line while you climb the stairs because there's no balcony or plataform at the",
          "Not for the feint hearted! The tower itself is all stairs, mostly inside, with the very top part outside, which feels very high and can get quite windy. But, the views when you get there are great. Expect a lot of climbing, some steep parts, and some waiting for others to",
          "This church is beautiful. After climbing the 400 steps you can enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of Copenhagen.",
          "You could get a really nice view of Copenhagen from the top of the church. But you will need to climb some narrow staircases, but definitely worth the climb!! A must see\uff5eEven the church itself look beautiful from the outside.",
          "What an amazing building, with its spiraling exterior stairs rising into the sky. Climb up the inside of the functioning bell tower and emerge out into the open air for the final stair climb. The stair cases are narrow and steep in parts so be prepared for a bit of effort. The",
          "Fantastic views, quite a challenging climb as some inside and some outside the tower but views were worth it.",
          "An interesting way to see the views. Well worth the entrance fee. The railings on the external section of the stairway are high enough to reassure all but the most sensitive acrophobics. It's one of Copenhagen's unique experiences.",
          "This beautiful church has one of the highest towers in the city with a super nice view over the city. This is also the highest tower you can climb in the city. The entrance fee is 50, - and for students 40, -.",
          "I puchased the Copenhagen City Card which included entry to this site. Also, I took the Hop On/Off bus which stops a block away. I did this in May, before the hordes of summer tourists. Even at that, I had to wait about 30 minutes before I could go in. They let only a",
          "This is a must do if you are fairly fit.I do not recommend it if you are overweight, unhealthy or have problems with heights and stairs. It's a small fee to enter maybe 7 euros but it is well worth it. This may be one of the only churches in Europe with an outdoor spiral",
          "Really beautiful, better from a distance though like most tall structures. Didn't go up purely due to how hot the weather was but looked fab. See from Christina lake.",
          "This church was lovely, its highlights are its spire that you can walk up (on the outside) and its organ. Other than those two elements, it's not that impressive but it is lovely and worth a visit if you've got the time.",
          "After a queue outside we began our climb. There is one way up and one way down. This means that you sometimes meet people coming down / up. It's also very high with a low-ish railing at the top. Not for the fainthearted! We had a great time!",
          "A visit on the top of this church is a must! The view is amazing, the whole city in front of your feet!",
          "Great view from the top of this unusual spire. Costs 50kr but on a good day, the view is worth it! Be aware the steps gets quite steep and narrow at the top before you go out onto the spire.",
          "Walk up to the top to get a panoramic view of Copenhagen. Worth the pain in the legs later. They also have a cafe near the top of the church for visitors.",
          "This place is centrally located and can be seen from far. Architecturally beautiful. One has to climb 400 stairs but it is doable. If you are scared of heights please go only till half way. Most of the attractions are covered under Copenhagen card.",
          "This is a great and ornate church located near the center of Copenhagen. Even thought is't not as \"ambitious\" as other churches as far as relics and decorations go, it's still a nice place to visit. Climbing up the 400 steps to get to the top of the tower is an added bonus",
          "We absolutely loved this church. When we got there we went straight to the tower-- there was a little queue out of the door but it soon went down. Its very cheap to go up the tower considering and is very much worth it. The only thing I would warn about is the walk up to the",
          "What a stunning building. So clever to see the tower twist like that. It was hard work as I'm scared of heights, but I made it to the first balcony via internal stairs. I saw the bridge (famous for the film and TV series, The Bridge) in the distance, I love seeing things you",
          "This was such a fun thing to do for our family while visiting Copenhagen. Even when crowded, the climb to the top took only about 15 minutes. The stairwell is *very* narrow (you will get cozy with people going the other direction, there is one way up and it's the same way to",
          "A church turned to be panoramic viewing of the city on the top.I didn't use my drone, but instead I climbed the tower.Be careful on climbing it on windy days, because it is terribly dangerous. On the top is very rewarding.",
          "Without a doubt the best views of the city. On a clear day you can Sweden! The cost was 35DKK per adult. The queue was long as they only let a few in at a time but it truly was worth the wait. Being extremely honest, if you're a larger person, unfit, or scared of heights, you",
          "Situated on the island which also hosts Christiania, Our Saviour's Church is a must on your walking tour of the city. If you are physically able, climbing the 400 stairs to the top of the tower will reward you with a beautiful view of the city. If your legs are not up to it,",
          "We climbed all the way to the top. luckily it was not too crowded because several places are one way only and you have a backlog of people climbing up and down. views were spectacular - would highly recommend this on a clear day. - beware the bells ringing while passing thru",
          "Amazing view over Copenhagen. Both the view and the walk to the top can be breathtaking. But it's worth it.",
          "I didn\u2019t go all the way to the top of the church because the queue was very long, but wow what a beautiful baroque building! I was left speechless by the magnificent organ that turned out to be one of the most photographed music instruments in the world. I highly recommend",
          "Afraid of heights or confined spaces ? if so forget this. It costs (\u00a34.50) its a steal because the views once you reach the top are worth double that. Be prepared for some delay as its one way in and one way out. As an English person I loved the fact there was none of this",
          "Great view - gets narrower as you go up but it is impressive. It is four hundred steps to the top but worth it. Legs were a bit sore on the way down, think you need to have a level of fitness to tackle this activity.",
          "On our last day in Copenhagen I encouraged my daughter to climb to the top of the steeple to see the views from the top. It was quite a climb up the steep wooden stairs and I have to admit our legs ached when we got to the top but the views were worth it. Not sure how it copes",
          "The climb up the steep steps of the church was well worth it! The view was amazing, but the steps up the outside of the tower on top aren\u2019t for those who don\u2019t like heights like me! I stayed on the observation deck while my husband went up. Definitely a must do!",
          "One of Denmark's most famous churches. Popular with visitors to climb the 400 steps to the top for a fantastic view. Not recommended for people with weak knees.",
          "Fantastic church which combines a fantastic walk to the top of the spire - an absolute must to visit if in Copenhagen- be aware it gets very busy and there is very little room towards the top of the spire",
          "You can't miss this church tower which has the unusual feature that you climb to the top of the spire, finishing with an external spiral staircase. It starts normally enough inside the tower, and the stairway narrows as you climb before the ascent on the summit When you have",
          "It was first monument we have visited in Copenhagen as the gold tower it\u2019s visible from far. It\u2019s a big job to get on the top as it\u2019s plenty of stairs, very steep and narrow. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anybody with mobility issues. The view on the top it\u2019s spectacular and be",
          "Great experience. It took me 3rd time to get inside as 1st time I was early arrived, 2nd time close for windy and 3 rd time yes I did it at 10 am sunny day lovely. I was bit afraid once I get to last steps in top outside as is impressive the view and looking down through",
          "Just over \u00a34 for a ticket and well worth it! Obviously it's best to go on a clear sunny day if possible to see some majestic views across Copenhagen.",
          "This church sounded interesting so walked to it. Entrance to the tower is cheap. The church itself is closed to tourists. The internal climb to the steeple consists of uneven wooden steps, not good for those afraid of heights! I climber the 250 steps to the platform, at that",
          "To be honest i surpised myself by climbing up this tower. I didnt have and plans to. I wanted to go up close to take a photo and found myself in a line to go up. I do think there should be a sign and possible pictures of what it is like going up. The tower is free to go up if",
          "A bit annoyed by this attraction. I went out of my way to visit enticed by a climb up the impressive looking tower. Ten minutes after opening time the door was still locked. Eventually someone who worked there came by but I really had to knock determinedly at the door to attract",
          "This impressively large brick church is close to a railway station and Christiania. Highlight is the 400 step climb to the top of the spire. Internal wooden steps make way for copper steps higher up. The architecture and craftsmanship is absolutely incredible. Outstanding",
          "Definitely worth a visit! It\u2019s a lovely church which you can climb to the top of. The best part is you climb the outside of it near the top! Once on the outside the views are amazing! Don\u2019t miss it while you\u2019re in Copenhagen!",
          "On the first day the tower was shut due torain, on the second day we managed to get half way up. People were saying the next lot of steps up were slippery. When we reached the bottom the whole tower was shut again.",
          "I am sure the church is very nice, but unfortunately my family trekked about 30 minutes through substantial rain to get to the church, only to find their stated opening times on their website were incredibly incorrect. The tower was closed and we couldn't even visit the church.",
          "The one and only day that was sunny. Amazing view from the top of the spire. I even got a little leg shaky higher up (surprising as I rock climb!)",
          "It looks magnificent and the story behind it is great. Shame I was too tired to go upstarts and nevertheless it was great tobsee it from the ground perspective.",
          "queuing is a little bit long because it allows only a certain number of people climbing up at the same time... climbing can be tricky for over weighted people and elderly people... sneakers are better than high heels!!",
          "A beautiful church, but the attraction for me was scaling the stairs located on the outside of the steeple. The top of the steeple offered beautiful views of the city. My husband, who is somewhat bothered by heights, refused to join me. But if you're okay to climb a lot of",
          "Such a fun place and super cheap. The church is very beautiful but the tower is amazing!! This really is a must see place in Copenhagen!",
          "The first thing you need to know about this church is the hours! It does not open early. I believe it opens at 11:00 AM. SO plan your trip to this area accordingly. The bells that ring when the clock strikes an hour is nice, so you may want to be there when this happens. It is a",
          "I\u2019m not a fan of heights so was wary of going up the tower however I joined the rest of the family in the 400 steps to the top! There are some steep staircases within the building and I did nearly bottle it when we got to the outside steps but they were actually easier to climb!",
          "If you are not afraid of heights dare to climb the stairs outside the tower. the panorama from the top won't disappoint you!",
          "Lovely church and was open to the public. Unfortunately we were unable to climb the tower, due to it being shut until 23rd Feb.",
          "Discovered this church when we went on a canal tour of Copenhagen. Most climbs to close to the top of a church spire are normally done inside the spire. This one was on the outside! Apparently it is a left-hand spiral and should have been a right-hand spiral. Nevertheless it was",
          "As we made our way up the internal staircase to access the external helix spire staircase, we were thrilled to enjoy a carillon concert! WOW! What an experience! Do not miss going all the way to the top...just follow the external winding staircase until you cannot go any",
          "Before I begin to tell of this attraction I\u2019d like to say make sure you dress warm it\u2019s cold at the top and I got sick for days \ud83d\ude44 it\u2019s definitely a must if you want a birds eye view of Christianshavn and the surrounding canal and Christiania, it\u2019s a pretty steep climb so I",
          "There can be long queues here but this church gives you the best views of Copenhagen and you can see across to Sweden on a clear day. Don't attempt if you are too claustrophobic.",
          "Climbing to the top of this steeple is as fun as it looks, and not scary at all. The church interior is interesting, but the climb to the top is spectacular. I don't remember that it was in any way strenuous, and it certainly was not frightening, even on the outside towards",
          "We stumbled on this church and went inside for a look to arrive just in time to listen to the pipe Oran being played. It was wonderful. We would have liked to have climb up the steeple but it is closed in winter.",
          "The curch is very beautiful and take some time to study the history prior to visiting the curch. Especially the story about the spiral stairs leading to the top of the spire.",
          "What a beautiful church! It's mesmerizing to watch watch the spire as you walk around to get different photos of this place. Definitely a must-see attraction.",
          "Stunning architecture, definitely worth a look. Although we didn't get to climb the tower as we felt out children were too young for this one.",
          "We had to wait in line for close to 30 minutes to get into the tower, and you do have to pay a fee. However, it is worth it, the views are very good and climbing the tower was a fun experience. I saw a few reviews that said it was closed in the winter, but we were able to do",
          "We couldn\u2019t go in as there was a service on Sunday. Also you can\u2019t claim the outside tower in the winter. Still a cool church to look at",
          "The tower of the church of our Saviour used to be climable . They considered it not to be save so the possibility was open for us . Still worth the visit",
          "Such an unassuming facade, almost blends into the street. The interior is quite exquisite, with a beautifully delicate ceiling detail & lighting that make for an almost intimate setting.",
          "I didn\u2019t actually get inside to take some pictures as there was a service underway. However, from the outside the church looked stunning and I was able to get some great pics.",
          "With Copenhagen having lost so much architecture to its eternal flames, we are lucky to be able to see and adore this beautiful building with a fantastic organ. Do check if their have a concert on.",
          "Fun activity with great views. We went early on a Friday morning so it was not crowded. In Copenhagen Card.",
          "If you are not much into visiting religious buildings, make an esception just for this one in Copenhagen! The Church is very beautiful from the outside and it doesn't let you down when you go inside it.",
          "Really hard to get on top but worth all the efforts. View of the city is fantastic. It's a must do thing in Copenhagen",
          "A must visit in a lovely part of Copenhagen. The organ is especially amazing and was playing when we visited which made the experience magical.",
          "I am drawn to towers. The city hall in Sienna 14 years ago and its swaying wooden stairs... Anyway, I felt more secure climbing this exposed tower that I have felt in many enclosed towers. The railing was significantly higher than I had imagined it would be. The tight loop",
          "The location of the church is a bit tucked away in from the main road. Views from the first observation point are some of the best in Copenhagen. Climbing to the top can be tough especially if you need to stop and wait for others to pass. Towards the top the climb becomes very",
          "For the best view of Copenhagen, my vote most certainly goes to this church! Located in Christianshavn, this church is a respite in many ways.... a prayerful place for the soul with its quiet church hall, an uplifting atmosphere for the spirit when the pipe organs plays, a",
          "Beautiful, unique church tower. Great experience to walk all the steps up through the old building (a little exercise) and thrilling when you reach the top and the railing suddenly do not feel like it suffices the steepness of the narrow curves of the remaining tower when you",
          "You can go up the tower at certain times of the day and weather permitting. I didn't I just viewed it from outside.Our tour guide said it's an old rickidy wooden winding staircase. So I'd say the view is amazing,up to you if you want to do or not!",
          "This tower must offer one of the best views of Copenhagen. It's quite a climb but if you're relatively fit and don't suffer from vertigo you'll be fine. Beautiful building too, one of the highlights of Copenhagen for me.",
          "We went on a wet winter Saturday to find that the church was closed for sightseeing as a service was taking place. They also closedf the tower as the steps were slippery.",
          "If you afread the hights, don't do it. It is scary but also so exciting when you are closing to the top. The view is amazing",
          "If you are afraid of heights, I think it is better not to go. The steps are very narrow and steep at some of the places. Beautiful place with lovely view.",
          "Famed as highest point in city. Not eiffel Tower or empire state. Does give panoramic view, but in cramped quarters. Not bad. Leave out if you stuck for time",
          "Of all the towers we climbed, this was the best and highest view of the city. Lots of steps so helpful to be in shape. Not sure worth the extra money to go up, but definitely worth it with the Copenhagen card",
          "The climb to the stop is very worth it, it was a bit windy and scary at times and there is a lot of steps but the views and the experience is amazing",
          "A really unusual church and spire. Visit it if you are on your way to Freetown Christiania. Or see it from a canal cruise.",
          "Unfortunately this was closed to visitors when we went on a Sunday afternoon, however we did walk around the church and managed to get some pictures of the huge tower...",
          "After a 400 step climb the views from the top were spectacular, only slight negative point was the distance from the centre of Copenhagen which was around a mile.",
          "This is a must! The church is beautiful inside, and if you\u2019re not of a faint heart then it\u2019s worth going up the spiral steeple for a panoramic view of the city!",
          "The design definitely stands out. If you like design and architecture it's worth a visit. Also, the location is super central so you can combine a visit with shopping too.",
          "The beautiful tower is a must see when you visit Copenhagen. The entrence is fair Price. You have a great view from the top. It is a long trip to the top, but Worth it.",
          "400 steps is totally worth the walk to the top, it's a very awkward tight squeeze at some points and the queue was big, but totally worth the view at the top",
          "A nicely decorated church well worth the visit. You can climb the clocktower if you want, and i recommend it! It costs a couple of euros but it's well worth the price and the climb. The view over Copenhagen is breathtaking!",
          "Be aware that the climb is steep in places. It can get busy and there are parts where you may have to go back down to let others pass. It\u2019s however lovely the see the bells and inside of the church. The best part is the spiral staircase you climb outdoors. It can get wet and",
          "This was quite the climb. It starts indoors but the last part circles on the outside to the top. We did this with some bad weather, which is less pleasant, since it get\u2019s crowded when you get close to the top and it get\u2019s packed. Not a lot of space to have a nice view over the",
          "Great view if you don\u2019t mind climbing 400+ steps, and have a head for heights. Over in the Christianshavn area of the city.",
          "On a grey day, the view isn\u2019t spectacular, but still worth the climb. It is a difficult climb though. (I\u2019m not a youngster!) Much of the climb is on narrow wooden stairs, often more like ladders than stairs. Many should be one-way at a time, and when I was there people were",
          "It costs 30 dkk (adult) to go up the tower, to get an amaizing view over the city. Definitely worth the money! (Also: student discount available) +not as claustrophobic as you might think, I have this mildly, but everywhere windows and fresh air on the inside stairs.",
          "Really nice visit with a lot of, sometimes scary, stairs. Really a typical attraction. All the stairs are made of ancient wood. The view is interesting. But they only allow 60 people at the same time inside. So be prepared to wait on weekends. Great visit",
          "We queued quite a while to get in but once inside was well worth the many steps to the top, offering great views all over Copenhagen.",
          "It takes a few hundred steps to reach the top and the steps get narrower as you go higher. However it is worth the effort to climb to the top as the view outside was awesome seeing the whole of copenhagen. The only negative is the difficulty to find a parking space if you are",
          "We went to the church specifically to climb outside the tower. However when we got there it was closed as it was considered to windy. Get there as soon as it opens and avoid the wind.",
          "Beautiful building, the roof top is very high, and not easy to reach, but worth to visit because the view is beautiful.",
          "Quite a long queue waiting in front of the church. As soon as you are up on the top (which means mastering an outside stairway - be brave!) you will understand",
          "We were not able to enter as the hour of service we very limited. The architecture appeared very sophisticated and interesting from outside.",
          "I got there about 3pm and queue was quite long to go to the top. I decided not to do the climb (because hubby was waiting). Very interesting building and the Church is lovely",
          "Not wheelchair accessible!!! Lol Steep and tight but try to get to the last step for a great view... look close at my pic of a girl in our party to see how small the last step actually is! Good time to be had by all a must in Copenhagen....",
          "Arrived on time only to find the tower tour cancelled due to \u201cweather conditions.\u201d It was a nice sunny day w/ some wind but nothing too extreme. So disappointing as there aren\u2019t that many tourist attractions in the area to go all the across the bridge to this east side of the",
          "This church has got a unique spiral top which attracts tourists from far. This spiral type dome architecture has been replicated in other countries like Qatar but this remains the one to be seen. We couldn't go on to the stairs as the church was closed for the day (though it was",
          "I've climbed into a lot of buildings over the years- on stairs, on elevators, on scaffolding, on ladders. If you want to get to the top of this one, you have to leave the comfort of the balcony and take to the outside of the spire, which climbs in a pretty wedding-cake pattern",
          "One of my parents has been a church organist for 40+ years, so I've seen a LOT of churches and a lot of church organs. That said, this church is breathtaking (including its organ) and worth a stop to look around. It was raining hard and very windy the day we went, so sadly, we",
          "The church itself was lovely inside, fairly modest and plain but to very good taste. The top and spire is why people go, you can Queue and go up but the wait for a walk up was long. It\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. We took the water taxi to get to it, you could also get",
          "There was a bit of a queue for the tower when we arrived, but it moved on steadily. There are a lot of steps up to the top but once you get there the views out over the city are phenomenal. Pop your head into the church as well afterwards.",
          "The ascent is not for the faint of heart. You have to climb through the cellar and when you get outside the passage gets narrower and narrower, but the view is incredible!",
          "Beautiful tower from the outside. They have places to stop to rest, information explaining everything and you can see the bells. Quite a unique tower. Really enjoyed it.",
          "Very unique church, you can climb the stairs all the way to the top of the steeple for breath taking views of the city. Be warned not for the feint of heart as the last 100 or so stairs are on the outside of the steeple. It's worth it though for the views and picture",
          "My friends and I climbed to the top of this tower which was very towering but worth the climb we got an amazing view of Copenhagen from the top and we could see all the way to Sweden!",
          "The view is great, but if you have any fear of heights, the place will not be very pleasant to you, but the view up there is very good given that most of the nearby areas of the city doesn't have any tall buildings",
          "The Church is very easily accessible by foot / public transport.. it's a beautiful structure..eye-catching from if you take a boat ride, but difficult to take a pic from the boat ..get near by foot and have a stroll around this beautiful structure..if possible and your energy",
          "The Church of Our Saviour was built in 1696 I think. Located in Christainshavn area of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is hard to miss because of its tower and gold steeple. It is 400 steps to the top. The outside of the steeple is only accessible from April to October.",
          "On the boat and bus tour we saw all of this, and then we walked around for a bit and were able to review what we saw, very happy wirh our desicion , the guides are very good !!!",
          "The Church of our Saviour is in Copenhagen. The church has a unique helix spire with an external staircase. There are 400 steps on the spire with the last 150 being outside. The views are amazing. The spire can only be climbed during set hours that varies each day of the week",
          "Must visit attraction. Be ready to have some decent steep step climbing experience. Around 400 steps to be climbed in total out of which around 150 are outwards. Its really windy at top.",
          "Worth the trek here but wow, narrow staircase that goes extremely high up, spectacular views. Had to take it slow so I wouldn\u2019t hyperventilate! Glad to say I did it though.",
          "Stunning views from the top. A must even if you are terrified of heights. I almost had a panic attack on the top as the stairs are very narrow, but it was well worth it.",
          "Not a bad value for 50DKK, brilliant views, but not for the faint-hearted. Staircase is rather narrow at the top sections, it would most definitely benefit from a presence of a stewrad or two to facilitate flow of visitors going up and down",
          "My wife and I who are seniors climbed all 400 steps. Great view from the top especially when it was clear",
          "We spent a few hours in this area on a sunny September morning. This is another attractive European church. Its most interesting feature is the unusual steeple. Take a look if you are in this area.",
          "Must be the most beautiful church interior we've ever seen. The wood carved organ sculpture takes your breath away.",
          "Again one of the striking features of the city, the stairs can be climbed to the top! and the story goes that when it was built the architect commited suicide because the spirals went the wrong way!!",
          "Tickets are not that expensive. Quite a few steps to the top but the view is so lovely, especially when is nice, great weather with blue sky ! Worth a visit.",
          "Have to say I've never seen a church with stairs on the outside of the spire but it was very pretty. The 360 views of the city were beautiful and if you don't want to go all the way to the top there is an observation balcony at the base of the spire. There are a lot of stairs",
          "Are you agile, strong a stubborn like of a goat in Nepal? If yes, let's go on the top of this church! Several small and strange steps offer you a different point of view on Copenhagen (modern and old). 360\u00b0 of panoramas you can't miss.",
          "This Tower is a must sight in Copenhagen. There are many many steps, but they really pay off when you get out of the Tower. The best part are definitely the steps on the outside of the Tower, which lead nearly to the very top. The view is really great, you can see a big part of",
          "Unfortunately, \"strong winds\" meant the tower was closed on every day of our visit, although we would happily have taken our chances. It's still an impressive building to explore, inside and out, particularly the organ and font.",
          "This is a very unique church. It looks great outside and even better when you look down from the top of the church. Be ready to climb up 400 uneven wooden steps. But it is worth it.",
          "The tower of the church of Our Saviour is really extraordinary. I cannot think of anything else but the old picture that I saw as a child, of the tower of Babel written about in the bible. From the tower of the Christiansborg palace you also see this tower very well.",
          "I have to say as someone who isn\u2019t the fondest of heights it was a challenge but it was worth it at the top. There are hundreds of steps to climb and it can get congested with people going up and down. That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad before we went up they made us wait to ensure there",
          "Not for those scared of heights. Lots of steps that get smaller and steeper the closer to the top you get (id say you have to be relatively fit and agile) narrow in places and at busy times I imagine a little uncomfortable and crowded. We went around 10 am and it was just",
          "This church was founded in 1752. There are 400 steps to the top of the serpentine tower, the last 150 on the outside. It\u2019s close to Christiania and is an easy stop on the way there.",
          "We just had to visit this church as the unusual spire could be seen from the river tour. The interior does not disappoint. Not to be missed",
          "Fascinating steeple with steps going round the outside to the top. From pictures seen the inside looks interesting too. Unfortunately we got there too late to do either so check the times on line in the morning as it clearly closes mid afternoon sometimes.",
          "50 Dkr for the tower tour that includes walking up the steps to the top of the tour but it is worth it since it goes to a good cause and its a great view",
          "My husband kept spotting this swirly stair care encircling the spire of the church as we toured the waterfront area near Nyhavn. He just HAD to go see what it was all about. So we trekked over to the church and discovered a long line waiting to go up the spire. You start the",
          "I was not able to walk the tower. There was rain. But on a sunny day it should be a nice spot to view the city",
          "This a MUST to visit if you are in Copenhagen. THe church was builtback in the 1700's with an external sgtairway wrapped around the steeple. It takes 4 full turns around the steeple with beautiful views of Copenhagen, Check for opening times.",
          "You just have to do the climb. The view and outside staircase is great. The kids also may it up there. It was windy the day we went but worth it.",
          "make sure the weather is good ! lots of steps, not an easy climb for some I'm sure. ladders and such through the bell tower. Once you get outside and start climbing the circular staircase on the outside of the tower you will be in awe. dizzying heights and great views.",
          "Beautiful ornate church with lovely decoration and a peaceful atmosphere. Worth checking it out. Good",
          "Tough climb up the stairway but you get a great view of the city. recommended to complete your adventure in beautiful Copenhagen",
          "Worth a snapshot to add to your collection for memories of Copenhagen. Nice story about how architect rationalized counter-clockwise spiral",
          "The church spire is what you'll notice first- beautiful and unordinary! Try climbing to the top- it's over 400 steps but the view is worth the work. The church is also lovely. A good stop in Copenhagen.",
          "The spiral tower is such an impressive landmark! To be able to climb it, out in the open, is an awesome experience and provides great views of the city.",
          "If you are in the area - it is a nice stop if you enjoy churches. The steeple is quite unusual and the inside is free to visit.",
          "We could see this spire from our Airbnb and we walked the city and wanted to see it from above. I've seen a lot of church spires and this one was unique and needed to be explored. Just a mere 400 steps to the top up steep steps and narrow walkways to see an amazing view. It",
          "400+ steps and then The finale winding stair case outside the steeple, not for the faint of heart but if your legs can handle the climb the views of Copenhagen are spectacular! Inside the church was very nice too.",
          "You do have to queue for a while as the entry is controlled however it is well worth it and you are rewarded with fantastic views of the city. Not for those with a fear of heights, the inside is actually worse than the outside though with narrow stairs and limited places to pass",
          "Fantastic views, would recommend trying to make the evening for the views as the sun is going down, I also didn't have to pass that many people on the narrow ascent, as I entered 20 mins before closing. The girl at reception was incredible nice as she told me about the time",
          "Bit of a workout but definitely worth it for the spectacular views. Quite expensive but everything in Copenhagen is anyway. Wouldn\u2019t recommend for anyone unfit or nervous of heights though as there are some steep and narrow steps towards the top. If you can manage all that the",
          "A short walk from - and a marked contrast to- Christiania, you can stare up at - or climb up - the corkscrew spire of the Church of Our Saviour and look across the city. There can be quite a queue though!",
          "Making a visit to this church and walking up the steeple is what I would consider a must-do while in Copenhagen. I can\u2019t imagine there is a better view of the city.",
          "This was, perhaps, the only \"attraction\" I visited in Copehagen that I did not completely enjoy. The entry to the tower is extremely well controlled, only allowing a few visitors in at a time to avoid congestion. The climb up is not physically demanding, with places to rest",
          "It's little bit expensive for just a possibility to get on the roof, but view is really good. Also it's little bit extreme climbing outside if you have fear of hight. Otherwise it's quite exciting. Be aware that there are quite steep steps and narrow passes.",
          "The view was really beautiful. It was a bit windy, but I think it would have been really nice with sunny weather.",
          "We only did the 400 step climb to the top of the spiral as the church was not open when we got there. The climb is a good workout. The steps are steep & narrow in some cases, there are landings to catch your breath from the climb or you have to wait for others coming down (",
          "We made sure to stop at the Church of Our Lady since I knew it housed a statue of Christ and His 12 Apostles and we are SO glad we did. The Church is beautiful and tranquil The statue of Christ is very moving. At the base of each apostle is a symbol you and click with your",
          "The church can be seen from many places in Copenhagen and is definitely recognisable. Inside is impressive, but climbing the outside staircase is something that just has to be done. At the top you will be impressed by the magnificent views.",
          "This church south of the old city has one of the most interesting roofs I have seen in a church. Inside as well it is beautiful and you can go up to see the city. An absolute must if you are in Copenhagen",
          "Very striking church, colourful and can be seen from quite some way away. You are able to climb the outside of the church and I have to admit I wasn\u2019t one of the brave souls that climbed the winding stairway. Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re in the area.",

          "A very beautiful church. My husband try to go the the time but only made 120 step out of 400. He had fun trying..",
          "Only a limited number of visitors can make there way up the church spire at a time. When you start to climb the very old, windy steps you understand why. Very narrow, hard to pass those coming down when you go up. Patience and some level of fitness required. However the views on",
          "We visited and climbed the tower on a Saturday afternoon. Narrow staircases and waiting while one way traffic descends/ascends. Once back in the open, the copper steps lead you up and round to a dead end. Great views of the city, the red rooves, spires, waterways and so much",
          "The climb up the tower is not an easy one - the narrow wooden steps become more like ladders as you approach the top. There seemed to be no restrictions in place for the number of people allowed in the tower at any one time - on a hot summer day that made for a lot of people in",
          "The tower at the Church of Our Saviour provides a great view of the city and is fun to climb. You climb outside and spiral around the steeple with the walkway becoming narrower until you reach the tippy top. Well worth the price of admission",
          "Did the climb today. Fun, quick, cheap. Able to see everything in the area including the bridge to Sweden! Worth it - also the neighborhood, Christiantown, was super cool.",
          "Beautiful church inside and out,you can see the distinctive black and gold spiral from most of the streets in Copenhagen. You can take a walk up the steps but on the outside of the spiral tower and once at the top you get a great view of Copenhagen. This is a lovely church to",
          "We did saw the Church on our tours and walking around Copenhagen. We did not walk up, so can't comment on that, but it's rather a landmark of Copenhagen and quite unique",
          "You\u2019ll climb, you\u2019ll get to know your neighbors! We all want to get to the top! Had a great time saw some fantastic views- but wow, it\u2019s a workout :) bring a water :) they sell some adorable magnets if you want a cheap-thrill reminder of your hike!",
          "My husband and I walked to the Church of our Saviour first thing in the morning within the 24-hour period of our Copenhagen card for free entry into the church. This attraction is a little further away from the main attractions, and in retrospect, we should have taken advantage",
          "This tower is the only one I know with spiraling stairs outside of the steeple. The tower itself is really beautiful, with rich, yet simple details such as the copper stairs narrowing (of course) all the way to the top. I found the climb quite easy and very rewarding. My only",
          "You can see this church tower from just about anywhere in Copenhagen, so naturally, if you climb up it, you get a great view of the whole city. It's not as scary as it looks, the stairs are pretty wide except towards the very top (I didn't try to squeeze myself into the final",
          "This was a short bike ride from our hotel to this church. Normally you climb to the top of church steeples from the inside. This one you start inside the steeple but then head outside to complete the decent to the top. While your walking up the steps you will notice a",
          "We did not know this existed. We were going to Christiana when we stumbled onto it. It is included with the Copenhagen Card. Walking up the roughly 400 steps provide the best views of Copenhagen. You will also see the inner working of some of the church musical equipment in",
          "Why not visit on your way to Christiana? A larger park is located outside where you can take a break from the city and its noises.",
          "This church is available for tour and for an outside climb spiraling the tower of the church. Amazing views! Golden Railings are quite high and the steps wide and not steep. Don\u2019t miss this.",
          "We got there right as the church opened and I was so glad we did. There are about 300 steps on the inside and 125 on the outside of the spire. The steps are very narrow and only one person at the time can be on the steps. There are little cubby holes where you can stand and",
          "Not only is the curch stunning both on the inside and outside, but it is also a much better view of the city than the Rundetaarn, for example. I am sure you won't regret visiting the church and getting to the top, even if it's a but tiring going all the way up",
          "An incredible experience in Christiania, a very beautiful church. If you have the courage, you could climb to the serpentine spire with the 400 steps to the top, 90 metres above street level. I had a lot of fear. Believe me.",
          "This one is very good to look from the outside for its shape. Inside, basically its a waste of time!",
          "You can see this in the distance from central Copenhagen and it is worth the effort to go to it. We had hired bikes so it took only about 5/10 minutes to get to. There are bike parking places in the grounds. Architecturally impressive tower with the staircase coming to the",
          "The view of the city of Copenhagen is awesome from the top. The King liked to ride his horse to the top....so it is cobble stone slope with no steps most of the way! If you are in pretty good shape you can do this!",
          "If going to Christiania Freetown, this is definitely worth a stop. Amazing steeple. If adventurous try climbing the steps for one of the best views of Copenhagen",
          "Climbing the staircase is pretty challenging. The stairway is narrow and some steps are steep. The feeling is thrill near the top and the view is spectacular. By far the most wonderfull experience from climbing any towers. The church organ plays a very nice music.",
          "Great photo stop. Outside the spire is very unique. Inside there is an impressive amount of history. Views from top are unique",
          "Definitely something worth visiting. It is a very european visit of a very old temple with its old time and traditional woodwork, brass handles and copper steps.",
          "We decided to make it to the top and had to climb narrow stairs to achieve this goal. It was not an easy task but we accomplished it. Once at the top it is worth it as the view is gorgeous and one can appreciate how beautiful Copenhagen is from every side.",
          "I visited here with my friend at the end of July, our intention to walk up in the tower to see the views over the city. The inside of the church itself was closed, so no chance to see that. There was clearly a lot of waiting and a long queue to the tower, which we'd prepared for",
          "That was maybe the most beautiful church in CPN. But what was more amazing was the song of the bells.",
          "Went on the off chance Wednesday afternoon to climb to the top- wait not too bad even if it was stiflingly hot Well worth it to climb to the top- amazing views Would not recommend for any one with fear of heights nor if you have problems climbing some very steep stairs towards",
          "The Church of our Saviour is a very beautiful Church and with the stairs to the top of the steeple located in a spiral on the outside of the steeple, it is very unique. The climb to the top takes you through the beautiful, old, giant wooden timbers that frame the attic of the",
          "Location: Located in Chirstianshavn, which is easily accessible and can lead on nicely to Freetown Christiana or a Canal Tour. Price: Free with the Copenhagen Card - If you're planning on doing lots of tourist attractions or using public transport, this is a fantastic purchase",
          "We didn\u2019t intend to do this but as we walked past it was just too tempting. It\u2019s an amazing building and we learnt that the spire was approved by the King in 1749. Three years later the spire was finished and the King climbed the tower at a ceremony on 28 August 1752. We climbed",
          "If you are up to climbing the 450 steps - 150 of them spiraling around the outside of the steeple, then this should not be missed. The views of the city from the top are wonderful. The interior of the church (no climbing required) is very beautiful with one of the most",
          "You can climb to the top of the tower to get a 360\u00b0 view of the city. It's a wooden stair with 400 steps that gets more and more narrow as you get to the top. Once you get to the tower, the stair is made of copper steps. Graet view, well worth it. While climbing you can see old",
          "What a fab church to go and visit. The inside is lovely, although quite plain compared to some other churches! When you walk in make sure you turn around to see the organ. It's a work of art. You can't visit this church without going up the tower! Once you're half way up the",
          "If you, like me, like to climb anything in a city that is climbable, then this church is for you. The outdoor, spiral staircase that encircles the steeple is unique. The views from the steeple are beautiful.",
          "400 steps. Hard work, but rewarded with a good view. The staircase is on the outside for some of it. Quite unique.",
          "We didn't get to the Church but we climbed all 400 steps of the Tower and the effort was totally worth it! We were awarded by arguably the best view of Copenhagen from the top.So without any doubts do climb the Tower and enjoy the view!",
          "Paid to go to the top, in the heat claustrophobia set in, and didn\u2019t make it. Interesting looking building but not fun going up with a child in hot weather.",
          "The church itself is well worth it, but the climb up the steeple has lots of history, and things to see along the climb. Getting out is a bit of a start (you are suddenly very high) on a slanted floor (slanted down), so not for faint of heart. Make sure you go all the way",
          "Okay, are you up for it. This church is beautiful but its main point of interest is the staircase which allows to you ascend the spire - up that external spiral. No way... but it seems to suit some!",
          "Very cool thing to do! 400 steps up and 400 down in narrow halls and on the exterior of the spire too--very unique experience. Views from top are amazing and it's a good workout--people there are from all over the world and work together to let each other pass on the",
          "Good climb, nice view outside since suddenly you have to climb out of a hole and go climb up outside of the tower! Was a first, original. Inside there was orgelmusic with an impressive woodcarved instrument high up.",
          "In the middle of Christianhavn this small church is so intriguing. We waited in line to pay and made our way up the steep, one way, stairs to the first level. It is a roof with a wooden platform and railing. The views are wonderful and the thrill is equally good. I did not go",
          "I only had the opportunity to see this stunning church from outside as it was closed when I arrived. I was most impressed with the sheer beauty of the spire. It was impressive. It reminds me of a fairytale cake topping.",
          "To being Denmark the price is alright and the view is amazing. You can even see to Malm\u00f6 in Sweden. The climb is uniquely in that way that you first have to go up on a small tree staircase and then you will be able to climb higher outside where the staircase will become smaller",
          "You can see this lovely church towering above the skyline, its truly beautiful inside and out. Wasn't brave enough to climb the tower, but can imagine the views would be awesome. Well worth a visit.",
          "The outdoor stairway to the tower area gives you a exceptional view of the city. The building is an architectural wonder both inside and out. The decor is beautiful, ornate features throughout and the statues are very colorful. It definitely adds to the skyline of the city",
          "It is a good climb up stairs and ladders but the payoff is a beautiful view of Copenhagen. Well worth the climb. The architecture on the inside of the church is pretty too.",
          "If you take the boat trip you will get a quick view of the Spire and the most photographed tree, but up close it is something else. The 400 plus steps are a challenge and a bit of a squeeze at the very top but worth it. The views are spectacular and once you exit out side on the",
          "My husband took my 6 year old son up to the top. They absolutely loved it, the views were amazing. Not far from the canal so handy if doing a canal cruise to stop here.",
          "Take a walk, it\u2019s worth the view! Ironically the spire is best taken in from afar but if you\u2019re willing to pay the price you can go up to the top for some great views!",
          "We specifically went to see the elephants \u201csupporting\u201d the organ and were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful interior. Elegant alter, gorgeous organ, really a special and different church. We did not walk the cork screw spire but it\u2019s pretty cool.",
          "Having caught glimpses of the tower from all over town we were curious to see inside and what a beautiful place it is. Very light with huge windows ( no stained glass) and white washed with a vaulted ceiling encrusted with white cherubs. The theme of music is very noticeable and",
          "This is a beautiful church, and its spiral spire is visible from all over CPH, but I was so disappointed that we could not climb the steeple on the day I visited the area. \"Closed due to technical reasons.\" I did visit the inside of the church, and wandered a bit on the grounds,",
          "Great Hike to the top of the Church. We did it our first day ( the Same day as the harbor cruise) and the views helped orient us to the city. Very close to Christiania and you can do both sites at the same time.",
          "The view at the top is worth this 400 feet climb through the narrow spiral wooden stairway to reach the outside stairway. It is a counter-clockwise stairway, so ask the locals about the history behind it.",
          "I really suggest to go there and go up to the tower, pay attention to the wid and take a lot of pictures of the 360* panorama.",
          "My family enjoyed the trek up the church. The views were stunning. One of the best things we did on our trip. I highly recommend it. The 8 year old was the only one who could actually get to the very top because of his size.",
          "Climbed the 400 steps to the top of this beautiful church in Copenhagen. Incredible 360\uff9f views. We were blessed with a clear and sunny day and able to get some really good shots of Copenhagen. Highly recommend this climb!",
          "The inside of the church is stunningly beautiful. There was a very good piano recital when we visited and we happily sat listening to it for nearly an hour before venturing upwards. They manage the queue really well so isn't packed at the top. The views are amazing. And, for",
          "There are 400 steps, but it is worth the effort! You will need to pay attention to what you are doing! It is too narrow at the top to indulge in dangerous selfies. I would not recommend for anyone with balance, height, or climbing issues. It is NOT a safe place for small",
          "In Verne's \"Voyage to the center of the Earth\" , they visit Copenhagen on the road to Iceland. As a challenge before the trip they go all the way to the top of the tower of the church. \"Now you geg a feel of what is about to come\", the professor says in Jules Verne's book. It is",
          "Amazing experience to climb the tower with its outside staircase winding up to touch the golden globe at the top. Fantastic views at the top and the climb is well worth while with steep wooden stairs inside until the copper stairs around the spire. Great little animated history",
          "Reading some of the reviews here I was apprehensive about visiting the church tower but am so glad I did! I\u2019m not a fan of heights or taking big risks but was really proud of myself for going. It\u2019s definitely an adventure! The first few flights of stairs are indoors and straight",
          "We are oldsters - 69 and 71 years. We had no trouble climbing to the top. We had to rest once for a minute, but that was it. Along the way, we found a man experiencing a bit of acrophobia and he wasn't even all the way to the top. My husband has acrophobia, too, but he",
          "This church is unique in it's design: the inside stairs continues outside of the tower until the golden sphere on the top. Panoramic view, with some acrophobia towards the top. Highly recommended.",
          "A beautiful church with an amazing tour up to the tower. The church is free to visit, but if you would like the tour up to the tower there\u2019s a fee to be paid; 100 dk and the ticket office is one stair up from the ground floor. I was really excited while climbing up the",
          "One of the many lovely old churches in Copenhagen.This one you can venture to the top of the steeple if you are fit and game.A great way to see the city from the top.The railings are in a bad state and really need a bit of attention.But I suppose it adds to the originality of",
          "From here you\u2019ll get the best view OF Copenhagen and not FROM Copenhagen. Be sure not to miss it. Have guts to try the outside stairs.......?",
          "The church is in the Christiania area of Copenhagen. An area where people can freely smoking weeds A little bit awkward to realized this. But I think the church should be there and open all time to serve the lost soul :)",
          "The views from the top of this church are magnificent, but a few in our group had to go back down (before the top) due to fear from the height, loose railings and just fear that it wasn't very safe.",
          "One of the more striking church steeples that dominate the Copenhagen skyline. A large church tower with a unique spiral steeple. The climb up is quite arduous and not for the elderly or people in poor shape. You got to climb very steep stairs ( almost ladders) up the bell tower",
          "It was an amazing experience riding this historical tower. Feeling the engineering value of old engineers. It is a real landmark and I am so lucky that I have visited this place.",
          "We climbed the 400 steps of the spiral tower and got a great view of the city. On the way up, the stairs became very small and had little headroom and at time we had to wait for the people to go down before we could come up. It's worth the fun and the effort.",
          "If you are challenged by heights this may not be for you. It is an amazing experience. Climbing through the inner upper regions of the church roofline on very steep wooden narrow stairs that lead you to the outside of the spire which you climb on the corkscrew spire. Fantastic",
          "Most people go for the well known tower. The interior of the church itself is also interesting. It is worthwhile to spend some time and meditate.",
          "Beautiful church and amazing views of the city, even if you do not complete the climb all the way to the top. Well worth the visit.",
          "The inside is very beautiful and the top gives excellent views to Copenhagen and Amager. It is 400 steps so prepare yourself. Had to wait a bit to get to the tippy top because it narrows but it is very beautiful-great place to see the city.",
          "What a view from the top of this church spire, but what a climb!! Be prepared for steep, narrow stairs and stepping aside to let others pass on the way up or down, but well worth the trip.",
          "I absolutely loved climbing this spire. It\u2019s unique selling point is that the last part of the climb is outside. The steps are small and it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted but the views from the top are out of this world",
          "What a great, unique experience to scale the tiny steps up inside the steeple, passing the old bells cast in atmospheric lighting, and then climbing up the exterior steps to the top and to (unfortunately) nothing. They just end on top, no platform, no look out. Just enough space",
          "Entry to the tower is included in the Copenhagen card. It doesn\u2019t look that high from the ground, but as the staircase narrows and you get higher it is a bit scary. So if being around other people high up in an area that feels confining could cause anxiety, think twice. I",
          "Beautiful view at the top of the tower however it's really crowded and there is not much pace to move out of the way however the view from the top is absolutely stunning !",
          "Make sure to visit when the church interior is open because it is stunning with a huge organ and gorgeous statues. The optional tour climb is for agile, fit people because there are a series of winding steps the move through beams and awkward corners. It's a one way climb that",
          "Wow! This is a steep winding climb in a constricted old staircase. But, the climb is well worth the effort when you reach to top. If it's windy hold on to your hat and any small children! The views of Copenhagen are incomparable.",
          "Great experience to climb up on the outside of a building and get a great view of the city. Must do in Copenhagen.",
          "We were walking our way to Christiania when we came across this church. I wanted to try it but my wife was hesitant at first. But once we went in and started the climb up the 400 stairs to the top she became fascinated with the church. GREAT view from the top of the church and",
          "At the top of the church, there is a very picturesque spot with like the best aerial view of the city. Unlike the Rundtaarn or other places - there are no grates that obstruct the view - everything is very close and uncovered! There is also middle spot where you can take photos",
          "Let me start out this review by asking you, are you physically fit? Are you also able to maneuver yourself in tiny, narrow spaces while ascending wooden creaky stairs and ladders? If you answer NO to either or both these questions, I would skip this attraction and probably do",
          "If you are planning on walking in Christiana, make sure to take a small detour to take some pics of the Church of Our Saviour. The architecture outside is phenomenal. Sadly, visiting inside is too expensive.",
          "If you\u2019re looking for views I\u2019d recommend the Round tower instead. It\u2019s 50 kroner here for a long sweaty walk up narrow stairs. The outside railing is precarious, so don\u2019t head up if you don\u2019t do well with heights. Other than that there\u2019s not a lot here.",
          "This is another of Copenhagen's main attractions. You can climb the tower (think it was around \u00a35) and its worth it to see the old timber work, and then climb up the spiral external staircase (which is quite wide and easy apart from the last few steps at the very top) - gives a",
          "Lovely unique building with a stunning organ built in late 1600s, long walk to the top in narrow stairs",
          "Be sure to climb to the very top for an incredible view of the city! The winding outside stairway is not for the faint-hearted but it is worth it!",
          "This was worth the steps. The view is awesome.... But definitely not for the fainted heart \u2665. It's pretty high and the steps are narrow so don't have a big backpack with you. And select a day with clear skies so you can enjoy the view",
          "This amazing and beautiful historical church tower is a must see if you visit Copenhagen in the summertime. Experience the stair climbing all the way outside of tower and have a the best and most beautiful view over Copenhagen.",
          "This spire climb is so unique. You climb inside up wooden ladder-like stairs and eventually come to a fairly narrow viewing platform. The ascent continues up stairs hugging the spire itself. The stairs narrow to the point of disappearing just underneath the base of the golden",
          "We stopped in hear as we were walking back from Christiania. You can see the spire from a long way off and it looks great. We didn't do the spire climb, but the inside of the church is really nice. There is a fantastic organ directly over the main door.",
          "The iconic spite of the Church of Our Saviour is visible from virtually every corner in Copenhagen, so imagine the awe when standing right below it! Anyway, the ascent to the pinnacle is exhilarating. Yes. Most visitors I passed at the stairs were panting hard and I\u2019m sure all",
          "We were introduced to this church's tower when we were in a canal boat tour. We saw people walking up the stairs and thought about doing the same. Finally, we put it in our plan on the next day and did it in the afternoon. There were about 400 steps. The climbing was not scary",
          "with Copenhegan card, admission is free. I took the train to Christianshave Station. a 5 minutes walk and you will see the church. Another 5 minutes walk, you can go to freetown Christiania. Inside the church has a lot of angels statues. it's a free admission with Copenhengan",
          "Very interesting place. However, you should be very careful and brave to go right to the very top. But it worth it! Great view",
          "This was one of our favourite sights in Copenhagen! Make sure you brave it and get to the top as you see the most gorgeous view from the top.",
          "The church itself was not open to visitors when I went because there was a funeral on, despite the opening times being advertised as 11am onwards. We had gone the day before to find it closed between 1pm and 3pm so had decided to return the next day only to find it closed again",
          "My husband and I were so excited about this visit. But there were so many people inside the staircase, that it made it not as fun as it could be. The views from the top were stunning though - but make sure that you like heights before you get up there lol (my husband only",
          "Great views of the city. It\u2019s a small price charged for entry but a big climb to the top. Not one for those scared of heights.",
          "We enjoyed our stop at the Church of Our Saviour. The climb to the top was well worth it, but if you don\u2019t like heights then don\u2019t go. We witnessed one young man climbing on this hands and knees up because he doesn\u2019t like heights. We felt bad for him. The view of the city is",
          "Walking up the spire on Church of Our Savior was certainly a highlight of our visit to Copenhagen. There was a small charge, but its covered with the Copenhagen Day Pass card. At the time went they wanted cash-only (if you dont have the card). We had very good weather and the",
          "For roughly 8 USD a person (50 Danish Kroner) you can hike up the many stairs all the way to the top pinnacle of the church for a birds eye view of old Copenhagen. It is a hike through uneven beams and through different parts of the attic of the church ending up in the ever",
          "The climb was more strenuous than I had though it would be, but the views at the top are absolutely worth it! Not too terrible up until about the last staircase, which is quite steep, and the external stairs are a bit terrifying, but really, really worth it!",
          "The church is situated in Nyhavn area. A very unusual architecture and design. Copenhagen have many historic buildings and churches but the Church of Our Saviour is the most impressive.",
          "Nice place to visit. Beautiful to be seen from different places around. Take nice pictures even during your cruise for the tower.",
          "A beautiful church with great views. It was truly terrified walking up the external tower steps but you have to do it.",
          "This was amazing climbing up this old church. Never would you see something like this in the United States quite honestly because of the liability. The climb is not for the faint hearted! But the view is worth it!",
          "This is a lovely little church. If you have the energy you can climb the tower for a view over the city. Inside is peaceful & has a magnificent organ surrounded by the most amazing wood carving.",
          "Since I got the Copenhagen Card the climb is included otherwise it is 50 dk. I wanted to do this and read to do it earlier so on Tuesday i got there at 9am but they don't open the stairs until 9:30am. I was first in line which was great I was up and down in 24 mins. The view",
          "Climbing up the tower is very nice indeed. The wooden structure is interesting and the sight up there is for sure worth.",
          "The best views of Copenhagen! Bring a camera...It\u2019s worth the climb to the top. Suggest going early or during a weekday to avoid crowds.",
          "A must see if you are fascinated by art or architecture. Great views and a tranquil environment inside with lovely designs. It\u2019s certainly worth a visit- they don\u2019t build like this anymore!",
          "Free entry to church and small fee to climb the tower but free with Copenhagen Card. Health and safety doesn\u2019t feature in the tower climb. It\u2019s dark steep and narrow at times do not good if you\u2019re claustrophobic and as parts are one way you can wait a while to get up or down,",
          "Wear your sneakers and you\u2019ll be fine as you walk up the 432 steps to the top! The view is magnificent!!!!",
          "Admission included with the Visit Copenhagen card, we visited early on a June day. This is one of those venues where the pathway to the top is shared with those coming down. As a result, it is highly recommended to visit early to avoid as much of a crowd as possible. Walking",
          "Fantastic views over the city from the tower, right to Malmo in one direction. It was crowded on this sunny Saturday, so patience was definitely needed. Take a few minutes to watch the short informative and entertaining introduction. I am afraid of heights, and managed to get",
          "The steeple of the church is unique and worth seeing from a boat ride or on the ground. The climb to the top is via very narrow steep stairs. Near the top you go through a door to the outside, where you can either walk around most of the perimeter or continue up the outside to",
          "This is a beautiful church, but the tower is what sets it apart. It's a daunting climb, but there are a number of areas where you can rest. The indoor stairs end at a narrow platform (it seems to be a yard wide all the way around) with great view of the city. However, there",
          "I love heights so inevitably loved the spire. It\u2019s quite a hike, but steeped in history as you see the large pieces of wood that hold the structure firmly. The views at the top are fantastic. Some of our party said they felt a slight swaying motion.... Great activity!",
          "From the top of thew tower you have sensational 360 degree views of the city. My friends who stayed below looked like ants. You need to be relatively fit and able as there are some steep ladder staircases to climb. Its also not for the claustrophobic and its up and back down by",
          "Most exciting tower we have climbed. Great views of Coppenhagen as your spiral up the outside of the steeple! Don\u2019t miss this unless you dont like heights.",
          "Definitely worth the walk!!! A quintessential church from an era long since passed. Pay attention to the detail in the craftsmanship in every aspect of the building. You can feel the history.",
          "1stop with the metro \ud83d\ude87 from kgs nytorv and 10 min walk from Christians havn station You can also take the canals tour boats \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s a very nice area of Copenhagen where there are many things to see and do",
          "This church is on most sightseeing tours and the roof of the church tower is unique and beautiful. You can also go up on the tower to enjoy some nice views of Copenhagen. However you have to pay for this.",
          "The view from the top is truly amazing, though the climb is tiresome. The stairs are getting steppier the higher you go. My calves were hurting day after from all this climbing. But it was worthy it!",
          "The climb is over 400 steps but well worth it for the view. Not for those who don't like narrow or closed in spaces. The stairs are narrow and steep in some places.",
          "The very cool part of this church is that you can climb the serpent spire where the last third is outside! It affords 360 degree views of the city and is free! We had perfect weather and clear skies, you can see all the way to Malmo, Sweden!",
          "I always considered myself for a person not afraid of the hights at all. I live on the 23rd floor. But this... That was the scariest experience in my life! I went up somehow just to prove myself not to be a chicken, but when I went down, it took me more than 10 minutes to stop",
          "Went to this church on a Sunday morning at 11:00. We only waited about 20 minutes to get in. It was 50 krone( almost $8 US) to get in. The steps are nice and wide and then start to narrow. It\u2019s 250 steps to the outside and then another 150 to the top. There is a platform once",
          "Vor Frelsers Kirke ,it is a Wonderful place to walk around, enjoy the sights and people watch. I was visited this place yesterday with some friends.",
          "Take the stairs all the way up. Fantastic view from the top under the dome. Narrow and not for those narrow and not for those with fear of heights. Be there early as it gets crowded",
          "This was different because the last of the climb is outdoors around the steeple to the top. Nice views. 400 steps isn't that bad. Glad we went.",
          "Made it to the top! Scenic view of Copenhagen! Worth the climb! May not be for those that have a fear of heights, especially the spiral climb at the top. Interesting history of the church itself",
          "Church of Our Saviour is well visiting in Copenhagen. Lovely church and the views from the tower give you one of the best views across Copenhagen and the surrounding coast on a good day.",
          "It is a bit of a climb with steep narrow wooden steps. I managed to get to the outside but vertigo rushed in and I had to go back inside. Hubby went the last few steps to the very top and said the views were incredible.",
          "The church has a unique architecture with beautiful interior and challenging tower. The top of the tower is climbed on the outside, so it requires courage, but the view on the top is amazing. The staircase is narrow, they allow small groups up while other small groups go down,",
          "The church of our saviour is a beautiful building with striking architecture and history. I would recommend to all, my only hesitation in giving five stars is that it's not the easiest to climb. It is fairly congested and the stairs narrow. The views at the top are breath taking",
          "This place looks gorgeous in various lighting conditions. Every time I passed by during the day it looked pretty from all all angles at all times of the day. You can even go up the chapel some. It is known that the architect jumped off the top as he accidentally made it in",
          "Great views from the top but the staircase inside is narrow and steep, as you get to the top climb the rest of the staircase on the outside of the tower that gets more narrow to the top.",
          "We would have loved to visit the church, not the tower, too much queue, but unfortunately, during the time of tourist visit they thought well to make a private concert!",
          "Stopped there to visit the nice old church, and found it intersting. Guides explained to us the history and we found it very interesting",
          "Stunning place to visit, unfortunately tower was during renovation but even tho the inside of the church was great experience.",
          "This church is best known for its tower (daily 11:00-15:30, DKK35) affording panoramic views of Christianshavn, Copenhagen and beyond. But the queue is often notoriously long in the afternoon, and squeezing up the spiral tower isn't enjoyable at all; too many people try to",
          "stunning view over copenhagen from the top of the building. but i must say that I had a bad feeling climbing up inside the church on very narrow stairs. cant imagine what happen if there is a fire or another incident... only go there it you\u2018re not afraid of small rooms or",
          "Most amazing view I have ever seen of Copenhagen. The queue started long at opening time, but the moment opening time passed the queue went down extremely quickly and the view was absolutely phenomenal. Petrifying but beautiful!",
          "A Must See- one of the best churches in copenhagen to visit. My favourite. Apart from the steps to the tower (with the view), the organ and ornate carving supporting the organ is something to behold. Friendly staff that provided additional history.",
          "We walked up to the top of the tower on the outside and it was well worth the climb. Some of the steps are very steep on the inside of the spire, but they're pretty uniform when you get outside to the spiral. Great view of the city from all sides. Inside are some really well",
          "We really enjoyed the climb and views from the top. Note, the visitor numbers are managed so good to get their early.",
          "Sitting accross the road from the area of Christiania, this church has the most unusual of spires. A spiral spire. There is a visitors area that allows access to the spire and you can scale the dizzy heights. The church is a red brick affair and is quite imposing in the",
          "As it is not located in a very tourist area, it is not crowded neither is expensive to access. The great part of the attraction is that you can see the Copenhagen skyline. Remember it has no elevator so you must walk up and down the stairs.",
          "We where staying near and so decided to take the walk up ended up getting great photos and would recommend to others. Unfortunately they are over 5mb so can\u2019t share.",
          "Beautiful church located on the other side of the water from Nyhaven. Interior is beautiful with exceptionally organ from the late 1600's Organist was playing when we arrived. Wonderful to her the old organ music. There is a steeple access, which we didn't do but there were",
          "This was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Copenhagen. Take a bike for a day and explore the Christianshavn neighbourhood, but make sure you stop off and climb the tower of the Church of our Saviour. We did it on a perfect sunny day and were not disappointed. The views",
          "This is nothing more than a tower to climb, but that said its quite a striking tower. If you are afraid of heights or climbing very steep and narrow stairs then be aware this may not be for you. Some parks of the climb will require quite a decent level of mobility at least.",
          "A great way to see the Christianshavn neighborhood. The church is very close to the metro station and there are lots of cafe options for a drink after climbing all the steps. Not for the faint of heart...or those scared of heights. The spire stairs get narrower as it gets to the",
          "I'm in two minds about this one. The view from the top s stunning and the way up inside actually is also very interesting. The issue that I have is you have to wait a very very long time to get up (because its so small they only let a few small groups up at once. I was okay with",
          "If you get up close, sorry but a church is a church is a church. To really appreciate this building you need to step back and take in the amazing spire. My knees didn't allow me to go up and challenge the spire but for those that can, go for it.",
          "After many flights of stairs, you eventually get to the roof part of the spiral. The stairs get narrower and you really need to take turns going up / down. Though you can see the view at all angles of the city as you go up further, at the very top, toward the end of the \"spiral\"",
          "Located in Christianshavn , cross the water from the main city. Not for the faint hearted. A steep climb to the very top, via narrow steep stairs and wooden ladders, watch out for low protruding beams near the top of the climb. The view from the top is breath taking across the",
          "You gotta pay to go to the top and it is by climbing ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP! the view is Amazing from there, completely Worth it!",
          "This isn't the easiest of climbs, gets a bit steep at the top. But once you reach the top the views are lovely. You get to walk around and see great views of Copenhagen.",
          "This original tower is really worth climbing to see great view from the top! And it is on Christianshavn, so You can see Christiania from above :)",
          "The church looked good from the outside and is supposed to have a nice viewpoint. Unfortunately, i couldn't visit it as I was 2 minutes past 4, when the church closes entry to the viewpoint.",
          "We sought out this church after reading other reviews and so glad we did. It was off the beaten track, but so worth the trek. The church is of a gothic design which is also replicated inside. There was a wedding on, when we visited so we weren't able to take in the full",
          "This was cool experience! Great views and unlike anything I have ever done before! You can\u2019t be afraid of heights!",
          "Not an easy climb up to the spire but once outside it is well worth it. Try to visit at quiet times as it can be challenging making way for those going in the opposite direction. You definitely need a head for heights but the pay off is awesome views across the city. The novelty",
          "It's a beautiful church and the view is spectacular. The railings are not really low unless you are a very tall person. It's very safe to go to the top. You just have to be early because the line gets really long. But don't be scared of the line because it's only up to the",
          "Visited this on a snowy day in March, had a fantastic experience. Winding my way up through the tower to the outside platform then up the spiral steps you end up 300ft in the air. It\u2019s not for the faint hearted or anyone scared of heights & you would need to be relatively fit.",
          "We did not go into the Church of our Saviour but we did look at the outside. A really lovely building and worth a visit.",

          "We didn\u2019t go to the tower, the queue was too long. However the organ is huge and worth a visit. If you\u2019re lucky, the organist will play while you\u2019re there!",

Only one thing I would definitely change but that\u2019s the problem pretty",
          "I've been to this church a few times with family visiting me in Copenhagen. It is a beautiful church and definitely worth a visit, besides there are other great places to visit nearby so why not make this part of it. You can walk to the top! Well, technically you can climb to",
          "Brilliant views from the city on a clear day, don't climb if you are not steady on your feet or don't like small spaces - it's the true old town tower shape it's great and gives a fantastic view right across Copenhagen. The queues got quite big but it was worth the view. No",
          "A long wait (good Friday) but a good view of Copenhagen from the top. A long and at times challenging trip to the top, with lots of stairs, all at different heights and sizes. Same route up and down so a tight squeeze at times.",

Quite scarey when you are doing stairs. Getting to the top is test of your physical fitness\ud83d\ude01.",

          "The place is badly managed. The entarance is for the fee, but they take money without issuing the ticket or give a receipt. A few steps after you'll undrestand why. There is a big sign saying somthing like \"your visit is at your own risk\" (if something happens - they are not",

          "We climbed the church tower. There was a 6 minute video in English & Danish alternately that gave a concise history of the church and then, you climbed up the inside of the square bit of the tower. You then stepped outside and walked around the heater-skelter type narrow path",
          "The interior of this church is spectacular...don't miss it!!! Even though we weren't able to climb the stairs to the top as it was winter, we almost skipped it completely. It would have been a big mistake... so be sure to go inside and look at the organ, the altar, and all of",
          "The tower was closed when I first visited, due to bad weather. When I passed later in the day, it was open. This should be heeded as a warning to anyone who isn\u2019t steady on their feet. The climb, once you get outside, can be very, very slippery as you are walking on lead tiles.",
          "I mean there\u2019s very little to criticize here. It\u2019s a beautiful church spire, with awesome old bells inside on display. If it\u2019s a remotely clear day then pay the whatever it is 5/6 dollars or something and go climb the steps to the top and get some wonderful views. I guess in",

          "The Church of Our Saviour has an amazing tower and it is worth the visit. I would recommend asking the tourism office if the tower is open, as even during summers, it does not open every day. I went for two days, before I could get up there! When it gets very windy, they close",
          "...the steps around the tower are closed. That's what they are until the end of February due to winter season. If you cannot climb the tower the church isn't worth a visit - unless you are into churches.",

          "A wonderful old church. Open to visitors from 11 to 15:30. Offers a nice quiet spot for rest and some reflection. Architecturally attractive too. The tower is closed for winter but it's still worth going inside to take a look: it's not as ostentatious as the Italian churches but",
          "You can see this town from quite a distance, and it looks very interesting with its steep curve upward. Sadly, we did not get the chance to visit as it is closed for winter. The Church itself is very nice with some curious features, not least the giant organ resting on the back"

          "Great view from the top of the spire. Not great for people with mobility issues or who don't like small spaces or heights.",
          "AMAZING views. Not for those who are afraid of heights or those who have physical challenges with taking stairs (there are over 400 steps!).",
          "It is a lot of stairs but the view is awesome.",
          "Beautiful interior, but audio is lacking.",
          "Get ready to walk up stairs!! The view is wonderful and the excercise great!",
          "The wait was going to be so long that we couldn't stay. It's pretty from the outside but if you don't have time to commit (and the ability to climb a lot of stairs) it might not be worth it.",
          "A beautiful classical church building, wonderful architecture and it's in a good state of repair it looks like it has had a recent renovation, so very picturesque place to visit if you are in Copenhagen, it also has a big statue of an angel inside",
          "Very nice church. Worth climbe the tower.",
          "You can climb to the top of bell tower.Nice views!",
          "A unique church with a unique experience. Don't miss the chance to climb up the stairs and enjoy the beautiful view over Kopenhagen! If you are afraid of heights, you better skip this... ;-)",
          "We walked till the top. And it was so amazing to see the city from the top. People who are not scared of height should definitely try this. It is fun!!",
          "Climbing the tower was fun and there were great views. The church itself is beautiful too.",
          "This is a great and ornate church located near the center of Copenhagen.  Even thought is't not as \"ambitious\" as other churches as far as relics and decorations go, it's still a nice place to visit.  \nClimbing up the 400 steps to get to \u2026",
          "Nice view above the city. It's not easy to go up the clock tower and definitely not made for big or large persons. Prices were ok",
          "Beautiful church with lovely views from he tower. But be aware that the tower is closed during bad weather.",
          "The views were great and it was fascinating to see the bells and history.\nAt the top there is no platform, the stairs just get narrower and narrower until you can't go on.  It was a peculiar way to end the climb and a little unsettling.\nBut it was overly crowded and overpriced- hence only 3 stars.",
          "Nice to see but definitely not the main attraction of Christiania for me. The queue for the tower was way too slow and long, so I didn't stay for that. The church was beautiful but not the best in Copenhagen.",
          "Very beautiful cathedral, can orient yourself to it when in the centre of Copenhagen",
          "Great experience to see all of Copenhagen! Beautiful church too. Tight stairs and high, but not too busy on a Tuesday mid-afternoon.",

          "Spectacular view fron the tower, highly recommend it. Best panoramic view ib the city.",
          "Totally worth a visit. The church itself is unique and offers a commensurately singular experience. You can get a ticket and walk all the way to the top of the spiral... on the outside! Do it on a nice day with minimal wind and lots of sun \u2026",
          "A must see if you visit copenhagen. They have historical english cartoons that teach you danish history, and a view and architecture that blows you away. Also, the tourist flow is controlled against overcrowding, so this is a big plus",
          "Great place to visit , not really expensive, consider other places . But main reason to visit it's to get look on all Copenhagen from top of the church, a bit hard to climb up, very narrow spaces.",
          "Go to the top and enjoy the views. It is for everyone, YOU WON'T FEEL OVERWHELMED.",
          "It\u2019s quite nice to go up and you get a nice view on the city.",

          "A beautiful church with unexpected elaborate sculptures . I particularly loved the elephant sculptures. There is a fee to walk up the stairwell to get a beautiful view.",
          "Very nice thing to do in Copenhagen. The view is great. Inside the stairs are quite narrow and you often have to let people pass (up or down). Once outside you can reach the top until the golden sphere. Don\u2019t do it if you have problems with heights. The price is 35 for adults and 25 for students/reduced.",
          "A nice church with an amazing view. 50 krown for an adult and 40 for students so not to pricey. The stairs are a bit narrow and steep at the top bit manageble.",
          "It said \u2018closed during the winter\u2019 but what\u2019s all these reviews from who got to the top of the tower?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05",
          "Absolutely stunning views of the city. When you come out the top turn left and keep going up, some people didn't realise there was higher to go. You can always get higher in Copenhagen with beautiful views of Christiania and much more. \u2026",
          "What a lovely Churchtower - a must see in Copenhagen",
          "Well worth a visit if your in Copenhagen",
          "I stayed in Copenhagen for 3 days. I simply had to bike on a rental here at the beginning of each day to enjoy the beautiful cityscape despite the cold March weather. It was simply too entertaining to climb the spiral stairs fitted on the \u2026",
          "Beautiful exterior, nicely maintained church and also the 400 wooden and copper stairs. Magnificent view from top.",

          "An amazing Lutheran church, with an interesting spiral, outdoor, staircase where you will find an amazing view of Copenhagen. O and the climb through the bell tower was just as much of an experience as the veiw",
          "A tremendous view of Copenhagen and surrounding from this church.",
          "This beautiful church has one of the highest towers in the city with a super nice view over the city. This is also the highest tower you can climb in the city.\n\nThe entrance fee is 50, - and for students 40, -.",
          "Just visited the tower (access is directly from the outside of the church). It's a pretty steep, narrow climb (as you would expect), but quite peculiar in the last and highest part, when you can walk around and outside the spire on metal \u2026",
          "The beautiful church is also a visit worth, but most people come for the extraordinary tower, where you can climb the outside spiral stairs to the top (92 meters) for the best view over Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6 - a \"must go\" \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Lots of history and great views from the top.",

          "A very beautiful, bright building, and probably one of the morr interesting pieces of church architecture I have seen.",
          "Beautiful church, that places different variations of bell songs depending on the day we heard from our guide!  Staircase goes all the way up to the top, but that was not for me.",
          "A lovely church, the spiral staircase on the outside is unusual but it looks really good.",
          "Definitely worths a visit! Great views of the city!",
          "I really liked this church. It\u2019s easy to spot this church already from far away because of its intriguing tower, namely this spiral fence on a roof. Wonder if there are stairs? In case there is and you can go up on the top. Only over 100 \u2026",
          "just a simple church, a little fun if you fancy climbing the 400 stair cases",
          "My favourite view of Copenhagen, definitely worth the price of admission.",

          "Spectacular view of the city! Must watch when you have short time.",
          "Go on a day when it's not raining so you can go to the top. Best views in Copenhagen.",

          "The climb to the top on an exterior corkscrew staircase was unique and offered good views of the city.",
          "Very slow line during mid day. Recommend The Round Tower instead because a lot more people can fit.",
          "Climbing this church tower became, quite unexpectedly, a highlight and great memory of our recent trip to Copenhagen. Not that I didn\u2019t have \u201chigh\u201d expectations for this tower, but when we got there, the weather was a little iffy. It had \u2026",

          "Super cool tower, awesome wive and very beautiful church!",

          "It is the only fantastic church of Copenaghen because there is an amazing tower with a stair composed by 400 steps so you can do a good physical exercise to keep yourself fit. It is visited by a lot of people from all the world. From the top of the tower you can admire all the city, from Christiania to Bella Centre.",

          "Best place to have a view of entire Copenhagen",
          "You need to pay for the entrance. Adult price was 50 dkk, I guess. Reaching to the top is hard; you need to climb narrow wooden stairs. You can leave your heavy bags to the person who you pay to for a while because, otherwise, it might be \u2026",

          "A great place to visit, a great panorama of the whole area. The interesting part of this church is the tower, it's a must see! It's unique because you have to climb the stairs outside the tower, in a spiral, and everything gets narrower as you get to the top. You'll also see Christiania from up above.",
          "Inspiring, untypical architecture. Payment for entry only in cash :(",

          "Besides looking impressive from the exterior, the big church tower also offers an excellent 360\u00b0 view of Copenhagen.

          "You can walk up the stairs of this church passing trough the bells all the way to the top of its tower. The view from there it's amazing. As it is one of the highest towers in Copenhagen. Of course the sky should be clear to have a nice view. ",

        "wiki": "City Hall Square (Danish: R\u00e5dhuspladsen, pronounced [\u02c8\u0281\u028c\u00f0hus\u02ccp\u02b0l\u00e6sn\u0329]) is a public square in the centre of Copenhagen, Denmark, located in front of the Copenhagen City Hall. Its large size, its central location and its affiliation with the city hall make it a popular venue for a variety of events, celebrations and demonstrations. It is often used as a central point for measuring distances from Copenhagen.\nCity Hall Square is located at the southwestern end of the pedestrian street Str\u00f8get which connects it to Kongens Nytorv, the other large square of the city centre, passing Gammeltorv/Nytorv and Amagertorv along the way. Opposite Str\u00f8get, Vesterbrogade extends into the Vesterbro district and later crosses the border to Frederiksberg. H. C. Andersens Boulevard, Copenhagen's most heavily congested street, and Vester Voldgade pass the square on either side of the city hall.\nApart from the City Hall, notable buildings around the square include Politikens Hus, the headquarters of national daily newspaper Politiken, and Industriens Hus, the headquarters of the DI.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Hay market and exhibition area ===\n\nCity Hall Square is located at the site of Copenhagen's old hay market and the Western City Gate with surrounding fortifications.When the fortifications were disbanded in the 1850s, it was decided to use the vacant land for an exhibition area which played host to first the Nordic Exhibition of 1872 and later the Nordic Exhibition of 1888.\n\nVilhelm Klein designed an exhibition building for the first exhibition which was built at the corner of Vesterbro Passage which was built from 1870 to 1872. The four-winged, two-storey building was built in red brick to a design which was inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture. In 1879 the centre of the complex was re-built into a large domed exhibition hall.\n\nOn 1 January 1888 the hay market moved to a new location outside K\u00f8dbyen, the new cattle and meat market which had opened in 1878. The site is still named Halmtorvet after it. The main venue of the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 was a large timber structure topped by a huge dome with a flag pole at its top. Its architect was the young and unknown Martin Nyrop who was later also to design the new city hall.\n\n\n=== The new city hall and its square ===\nIn the 1880s, plans were conceived to build a new city hall on the grounds, and in 1888, the expo area was cleared. An architecture competition was held in early 1889. Apart from Nyrop, who won the competition, Vilhelm Dahlerup and Valdemar Koch were among the participating architects. The design of the city hall was greatly inspired by the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, Italy, and the design of the square was accordingly modeled on the shell-shaped Piazza del Campo outside that building.On 28 July 1894, the foundation stone was laid. When it was inaugurated in 1905, the square in front of it became one of the most central and important spaces of the city.\nThe square was redesigned in 1995 and 1996 by KHR Architects, on the occasion of Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture. The intersecting street leading from Vesterbrogade to Str\u00f8get was removed, uniting the two sides of the square. A bus hub was built on the northern side of the square.In 2010, work began on a metro station on the site, requiring a major reorganisation of the site, with work was opened on 29 September 2019.\n\n\n== Sculptures ==\n\nThe Dragon Fountain (Danish: Dragespringvandet), depicting a bull and a dragon in combat. Designed by Thorvald Bindesb\u00f8ll and Joakim Skovgaard, out was inaugurated in 1904.\nThe Weather Girl (Danish: vejrpigen) is perched high on the Richs Building on the corner of R\u00e5dhuspladsen and Vesterbrogade. It is a gilded sculpture group telling the weather. One sculpture  rotates to the front, depicting the girl with her bicycle. When the weather is set for rain, another sculpture rotates to the front, depicting her with an umbrella walking her dog. The sculpture group is from 1936 and designed by Einar Utzon-Frank.\nThe Lur Blowers is a bronze depicting two lur blowers standing atop a column on tiles. Standing 20 m tall, it was created in 1911 to 1913 by Siegfried Wagner.\nA statue of Hans Christian Andersen is in the square.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe square's central area is 9800 m\u00b2. It is often a venue for demonstrations and buskers, and several bars and nightclubs are located in the vicinity. R\u00e5dhuspladsen also houses one of the city's bus centrals.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nIn the Danish edition of the board game Monopoly (Matador), R\u00e5dhuspladsen is the most expensive location (see also Localized versions of the Monopoly game).\n\n\n== See also ==\nVester Voldgade\nHotel Bristol (Copenhagen)\n2000 UEFA Cup Final riots\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDen Nye R\u00e5dhusplads\n\nImages\nSource",

          "Beautiful big main hall, but most of the rooms were rather no-nonsense and plain compared to other fancy City Halls I've seen. Our guide was nice and friendly, but her voice was low and she tended to fade out at the end of sentences. The tour price of 60 DKK was not included in",
          "A beautiful building to walk by and admire, but even better to go inside! Anyone can enter and walk around, but there are tours in English and Danish daily for a nominal fee. The tour guide was amazing! We learned details about the building, the artwork and history that we would",

I was so intrigued by the exterior structure and it\u2019s simplicity yet complex detailing. It wasn\u2019t open inside or at least I didn\u2019t believe it was at the time I went. This was a",
          "We visited here twice, once in the evening and once on a sunny morning. The square has plenty of restaurants and is quite lively at night. During the day there seemed to be lots of tour groups around. You can climb the tower of the city hall for views but we'd already been up",

This is also the starting point for the main street, \u2018Str\u00f8get\u2019, which has all the shops you could wish for, as well as restaurants and cafes. Here is also a lovely statur of H. C.

          "Beautiful building, located between the train station and the city centre. It\u2019s location dictates that most visitors to Copenhagen will walk past the city hall and its square. There was a flea market on when we visited and buskers playing. Very nice.",
          "This is a remarkably historical and beautiful building. Be sure to explore the fantastic interior where consequential decisions were made.",

          "Shame some of our City Halls cannot look like this one. The bizarre statues round it made me smile, a lovely meeting up area, with eateries near by, also across the road from Tivoli Gardens. Hans Christen Andersons statue is right on one corner.",
          "As far as city halls go this is one of coolest I have ever visited before. The size of it is amazing. It is a huge building in the middle of the city center of Copenhagen with a large square in front of it. There is no entrance fee and you can just walk in and be amazed by this",

          "Very impressive old building. Went in and saw the arts that were exhibited. Went up to see the wedding hall. Saw two couples taking photos there. The square in front of the building was very large and tourists were taking photos of the fountain and the copper column. Proceeding",
          "We saw it on our way to Christiana as a part of the free tour, and I think that's sufficient. Even if you don't do the tour, I still don't recommend taking time out of your way to see it as you'll probably pass by it on your way to something else. It's a cool building that is",

          "Very helpful staff at the Visitor Centre inside gave lots of good recommendations of museums etc. The City Hall is a beautiful building and it's possible to climb the tower for great views. We saw two wedding parties there as they marry couples at the hall. There are free",

          "very attractive place with good view and some ancient materials with a good feeling! A most see place.",
          "I have been in this place over the years more times. And like this place, it is a part of a good story about Copenhagen and it is a must to see it. If you like old buildings, old story's and new, then go here and you will love it. Btw it is good on a Danish raining day ;-)",

          "The City Hall is a striking building dominating the R\u00e5dhuspladsen. Worth stepping back and looking at the architecture. There's also some gargoyles near the entrance that are worth taking a photo of. The city hall hosts various exhibitions. We visited a school art work",
          "It is a beautiful building smack in the middle of the city, close to Tivoli and the train station. It is a pity that climbing the tower is so restricted to certain days and times.",
          "Copenhagen city hall is a large and impressive building in the heart of the city. The building was constructed in the National Romantic style and completed in 1905. It's possible to go up the tower for a great view of the city. City hall is situated on a bustling public square",

          "My wife and I ended up at this location towards the end of our own little tour of Copenhagen, having first visited the Little Mermaid, then made our way to Nyhavn, and finally headed up in the direction of the City Hall. The City Hall is one of the tallest buildings in",
          "The city hall is a very commanding building and one that is easily recognisable. Located right next to the H. C Andersen statue opposite the Tivoli gardens it is hard not to see this building whilst in the city centre. We actually missed a trick on this as we were unaware there",
          "We were ushered in here to wait for our walk and not only was it warm (and free) but the architecture was beautiful and there was an art exhibition taking place inside. A real mix of pieces and wonderful to walk around and take in at ones pleasure! Worth a stop in even if you\u2019re",
          "One of the places you must visit in every city! City Hall of Copenhagen is very huge. Dont skip it. Take a minute for this piece of art!",
          "Going inside this building was incredible; seeing the architecture and art within it was a great experience. I chose to take the English guided tour for 50DKK, and I regret that it was not worth it in my opinion. Our guide rushed the tour, did not know some questions asked to",
          "It's great that you can go in for free and go up with a comfortable elevator. The view is definitely worth it!",
          "This is a lovely building and it is free to visit it. There is an interesting clock just inside the main entrance too",
          "The main hall in the interior of this building is beautiful. A couple was having their wedding photos taken while we were there. We didn't get a chance to go up in the tower and the Jens Olsen's World Clock was closed for restoration.",
          "You can enter the building and stroll along it corridors without buying any tickets, which I absolutely recommend. The only advantage of the guided tour is that you get to see some more rooms, but the tour itself is dull and uninteresting with a twist of cringy humour (at least",

          "If you miss the allocated time to visit the tower then there's not a lot to visit. It doesn't cost anything to go into the hall and you can visit the wedding room. The whole visit only takes about 15 minutes. the visits up the tower folloy danish time. If you are not punctual",

          "This is a city hall which expresses the intense pride of the citizenry in the capital city at the turning point of the 20th to the 21st century when half of the population of Denmark lived in Copenhagen. Danes love their flag, with its white cross on a brilliant red background,",

          "I previously called St Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium the most beautiful building in the world. However, the City Hall of Copenhagen can really compete. It is a wonderful combination of the simple robustness of the brick walls, and its subtle yet stilish sense of ornament and",

          "Part of the exterior of the building was covered, they were working on restoring it, but you can visit the interior for free. And when I say for free, I also mean that you can walk freely almost everywhere, see employees at work in their offices. The frescoes are the main",

          "An interesting building but few guide books mention the world clock of Jens Olsen. It is a mechanical marvel and one gear will take about 25,000 years to make a complete revolution. It is worth taking the tour up the tower but you will need to book and pay. Admission to the city",
          "It is a great piece of European architecture. When we reached in the evening it was already closed so we could see it only from outside. It is also the meeting point for all walking tours. Tivoli Garden is close by so also Hard Rock Cafe and famous pedestrian street Stroeget.",

          "We came through here several times on our stay in Copenhagen. It's right between the pedestrian street (Stroget) and the train station. Also across from Tivoli. The free walking tour meets here at 11:00am for the 2 1/2 hour tour around the city.",
          "I definitely would like to sa a BIG THANK YOU for the guided tour of the Slovak Mayor group (Austra Agency, 40 people) on 21 June 2017. I could not imagine that a City Hall can be this interesting and an architect such a perfect and complex personality. It is a phantastic",

          "There are 3 floors and galleries to wander around and amazing deep sinks with brass taps from bygone years all still in working order. It is historic and majestic with a lovely garden court from the ground floor, it is completely free.",
          "We stayed at \"The Square\" hotel across from City Hall. The area is currently torn up because a new subway station is being built. Even so, It is worth a visit if in Copenhagen.",
          "We arrived early at town hall to meet for our Sandeman walking tour of the city (which was excellent!). We decided to stroll through the building while waiting. The clock room was well worth our time, and we found its history and viewing the gears very interesting. We also",
          "Lovely town hall with plenty of history going on. Impressive paintings and architecture and loved the story about the clock - the most accurate in the world we were told. Don't miss the central courtyard with fountain. I made some new Chinese friends there too!",
          "Nothing dramatic about the city hall. We met several of out tours at this location. A very well known spot for tourists to find.",
          "The city hall was open and no fee to get in there. We loved the huge open area in the center....marble staircases and amazing architecture.",

          "you will come across the town hall in your travels...free to get in its a lovely building with a nice interior....in a side room is a large astronomical clock.....you won't spend much time here but well worth the stop",
          "use the hop on hop off too see this its so nice, the building is really nice. there was some display when we were there, like a band marching, apparently this happens once a day and is just for the tourists.",
          "That was the first major attraction we've seen in Copenhagen. Finding ourselves on the vast City Hall Square, just across the beautiful Tivoli Gardens, we were amazed with the view of this red-brick building in which are set the headquarters of the municipal council as well as",
          "You can climb the tower, but we were satisfied with the Italianate hall, and the amazing clock designed in 1940s, showing the planets and continents.",
          "While we met our tour guide at this location, and passed it everyday, we did not go inside. I am not sure if there are tours of the building or not. It is an impressive structure with a clock that strikes the hour and portions of the hour. There is a large square outside that",
          "The Copenhagen Town Hall is a popular meeting place but it is much more. It is very pretty from outside with statue of Bishop Absalon, Hans Christian Andersen, and dragon fighting an oxen from Asia. You can step inside and there is a magnificent old fashioned clock display to",
          "It was very cold and snowing when we went inside here, not entirely sure what the building was. It was beautiful with a huge roofed courtyard feel inside. It was great to go upstairs and through each floor and see the amazing ceiling frescoes, artworks, murals, chandeliers etc.",
          "We stopped in as it was on our way to the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek but really enjoyed our visit. There was a display of local school children's art that had some very interesting pieces. Highlight of the visit was Jensen Olsen's Clock, but that has its own entry.",
          "You must go to the City Hall Square and see this building.- Even if you do not go in, it is worth seeing.",
          "As well as being an elegant example of architecture, and housing a Tourist Information Centre, on the ground floor, there was a display portraying the lives of refugees who came to Denmark over the years. It was very interesting, and elicits greater understanding as the people",
          "Located in the heart of the city it's beautiful building that you can admire even from outside. The arquitect is so amazing",
          "If you are in the area, walk by and enjoy the impressive architecture and statutes. We used it as a navigating landmark to keep our bearings.",
          "Open to the public, easy access, next to the main train station, shopping area and Tivoli gardens. Will be back:)",
          "We walked round the city hall which was very grand but our favourite part was the world clock. So interesting to read all about it!",

          "The Clock inside the City Hall was one of the best thing to visit in Copenhagen if you are interested in technology. The Clock was build to show planetary position along with time in one system and all the gears mechanically coupled. The City Hall is used for events and well",
          "Stunning views from the Tower of the City Hall. Fairly easy walk to the top. You will go on a guides Tour. Duration about 45 minuts.",
          "Nice looking building. Very noisy due to metro work being carried out in front. Starting point for the walking tour",
          "This impressive building hides wonderful architecture and holds the very impressive Jens Olsen's World Clock , quite simply a beautiful creation.",
          "This is a lovely building from the outside and it's a working city hall but free to have a look inside. Beautiful building and well worth a visit up the tower.",
          "The city hall is open for visitors on guided tours ( 50 DKK, twice a day). More than 100 years old is extremely well preserved and reflects Danish history and customs. Lamps, furniture, even small detail were designed by M. Nyrop.",
          "This is a nice building in a nice square! There's a nice statue of Hans Christian Andersen, where his legs have been so polished as a sign of good luck from some tourists. Unfortunately they're building the metro so there was a lot of works which hindered the scenery in the",
          "In the center of the city, this building is outstanding mixing the old and the new of the city. You can go inside and if is Saturday, you can see brides and fianc\u00e9.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect when we went in here. Once inside we had a look round and found the beautiful d\u00e9cor and went on a tour up the tower.",
          "This is a gorgeous building inside. The tourist office inside has very helpful staff. The only downside is that the top of the building is limited access - only available twice a day to go up for the views.",
          "I only went in here as it was raining but was really impressed, beautiful details in the artwork and carvings up all the stairways and carved doors, this is a working town hall but easy to walk around all 3 floors and nice views of the garden courtyard, plenty of toilets,saw a",
          "The Town Hall is located in the centre of Copenhagen, not far from Tivoli Gardens and the main train station. The architecture of this building is absolutely stunning and there is a large plaza to the front of the building - great as a meeting point and there are usual a few",
          "We waited for about 20 min to get to the front and it was not even busy so in the summer it must be a long wait,however its free and you do get good views",
          "This was on my must see list, being a fan of The Killing. The Town Hall is a very impressive building, with a lovely clock tower. The large plaza in front of the Town Hall is a great meeting place. I was a little disappointed that the Toen Hall was surrounded by American icons",
          "This is definitely worth doing, fairly cheap to do and a lot of steps but the view at the stop is spectacular and gives a great way to start your visit to Copenhagen!",
          "The impressive town hall was bulit from 1892 to 1905 in a national romantic style and is more than a hundred meters tall. A must see in Copenhagen.",
          "At present with large amounts of building works to improve the infastructure to Copenhagen its true beauty is a little marred but you can clearly see it is a spectacular building by day or night.",
          "Your free to access this building at any time it is open. And what a marvel you will find once inside. Lavishly decorated with flags and opulent spaces. The only cost would be if you wanted to visit the tower. That you have to book and pay for and only happens a few times",
          "I only went to have the view experience at this historic building. You can access to the tower's view for free, not reservation needed and almost not queue to wait. It was quick and nice with the right info on the top of the place.",

          "Copenhagen Town Hall, is a very nice place to visit and was buildt between 1892-1905. The ceilings and stairwells are beautiful decorated. There's guided tours and you can also see the famous \"Jens Olsen's World Clock\".",
          "The free walking city tours start in front of the City Hall Building. In the corners of the building, on top, you will see the polar bears, at least that was what we were told, because they were not white. They said that they are white when it snows, dah.... !... I think that",
          "At some point in your visit to Copeenhagen, you will probably walk past this building as its near Tivoli and at the end of Stroeget. Quite an impressive looking place from the outside!",
          "This is a working city hall, ut it is also a monument built by the best craftsmen in Copenhagen at the beginning of the 20th century. Check out the great hall just inside the main entrance and consider a visit to the tower, which is one of the tallest in town",
          "Impressive silence, not oppressive, is what I felt walking the long corridors of Copenhagen Raadhus, climbing the large staircases from basement to top floor. Rebuilt around the beginning of the XXth century in Romantic style, it is said the architect was inspired by the Siena",
          "How often does it happen that you are in city for a day and see the Queen! Yes thats what happened. Apart from that its a beautiful building and square. Just good to catch breath and have a coffee or beer like the locals",
          "We planned our wedding to take place in the marriage hall of the Copenhagen City Hall. The town hall, and especially the wedding rooms are beautifully designed and impeccibly maintained. From the architecture of Martin Nyrop, to the furniture designed by Klare Kint, to the",
          "The building itself is worth a look out, for both the outside and the inside; the hall is particularly nice to look down from the balconies. However, there is very little to see in the building apart from the building itself.",
          "If you are in front of the City Hall building, please, go inside... It is free (public building) and you can see a little bit more....",
          "The Copenhagen City hall is in a great location and is a great Central point for you to start a visit, the building itself is fantastic too with a statue of Hans Christian Anderson outside and just across from the Tivoli Gardens. To the other side is streets upon streets of",
          "This building looks like good as outside so inside. From the tower opens the perfect view to the city center and harbor. Also, you can see interesting pictures about the history of the city. Entrance, except the tower, is free.",
          "Radhus is the Town Hall and it is located on the Radhuspladsen (main square). It is opened and you can walk around almost all building. Close to the entrance there is a very beautiful big hall, which you have to see. Moreover, you can go up to the upper floors and you can see",
          "We had pre-arranged our wedding here, incredibly easy to organise and what a venue. From the first moment you clap eyes on the building you marvel at its beauty and detail. As you walk in there is a gift shop / reception on the left and an exhibit room on the right, whilst we",
          "It's a nice building with a large square where everybody comes together on a new year for spectacular fireworks. It's a piece of history as well, if you're interested.",
          "Waited an hour for a ticket for the tower tour. We asked beforehand if we needed to reserve and we were told it was not needed as there were always enough places. After an hour we were told that all the tickets were sold out even though we started quieing 15 minutes before the",
          "I wish we had been able to tour the tower but there was so much to do in Copenhagen. The large room was well decorated and we walk the room and then walk the second floor overlooking the main room. The best part of the visit though was the astronomical clock.",
          "Beautiful and historical, the city hall is located in the center of Copenhagen in a square steps from the pedestrian street Stroeget.",
          "Its a nice building, but shadowed by Tivoli garden and Stroget. Chances are that you will walk pass there eventually without planning. Across the City hall is a construction project with a viewing deck, so check it out!",
          "a very nice and beautiful building of a city hall...inside there is the history of astronomical clock..",
          "I sugest a visit to this bilding if you are visiting copenhagen. Near to city center easy to get. You can have guided visit.",
          "The town hall is nice in- and outside! A long history from a bishop in the 12th century onwards. See his staute above the entrance. Look inside; a beautiful hall.",
          "Great area its situated in. Go inside and check it out. Fantastic place to hang around with lots of shopping outside nearby.",
          "beautiful building to appreciate the arquitecture, sculpture and watch people. Go around the building including the back to appreciate the details",
          "Stayed in Scandic Palace Hotel next to the City Hall. Imposing clock tower and the architecture of the building is along romantic lines. In the middles of the square is a large lighted Christmas tree. Other than this the large square stayed empty for the duration of my 3 nights",
          "Most places were closed on Monday at this time of the year. But city hall tour was available. I don't regret going at all . The hall and building is free for you to explore, which is interesting. But the guided tour is the one you should take part in . Not much of a guide, but",

          "When I first visited and saw this city hall, it looks like some museum due to nice big impressive square building. It is located at center of Copenhagen, and you can not miss it if you follow famous shopping road. There are always many tourists around it. It is opened on normal",
          "Walking around bought us to some pretty cool places, such as the City Hall square, which has some interesting buildings and fountains in.",
          "Unsure if you can enter this building but the facade is worth seeing. There is a large pedestrian square in front of it which provides space to stop and look even on a busy day.",
          "Can't comment on interior. Major gripe - cars driving on the front square! Building works opposite at the moment.",
          "Wonderful and imposing town hall building that acts as both a landmark as well as a meeting point for all sorts of excursions in the near vicinity.",
          "It's nice to see the really modern building for the Lord Mayor in London, and other cities in the world, but there is something special when you come across a building like this. Very impressive.",
          "The city hall building is fairly new ( almost a century ) older versions suffered terribly by fire in earlier centuries..offers a tower for viewing the city and has an impressive image of Bishop Absalom adorning the main side facing the square..inside you can feel the Moorish",
          "Radhus is just down the road from Copenhagen's main rail station, on Hans Christian Andersen Boulevard. It is inspired by Siena's architecture and is lovely inside and out and will need about 30-45 mins to see it. When I went there was a film festival going on and if you hang",
          "Had a wander around City Hall on a Friday morning and enjoyed taking a few pictures and seeing some of the exhibits. The flags around the main hall are a very nice touch. Not a whole lot to see here but it was free to enter and another site to tick off the list. There was a",
          "the free walking tour starts just outside this building. the architecture is wonderful and gold detail is amazing! didnt get to go inside though.",
          "If you just walk in city center you will find it and cross it.it is good but not so good to spend your time for it",
          "The building closed at 15.00 (in october) so I was not able to visit it inside, outside it is nice, it looks like Siena buildings. Nice lights at night.",

          "My wife and I stayed at the Scandic Palace Hotel right across the street. The City Hall building is nice but not a destination worthy of a special trip. That Bell sounds off every 15 minutes from 8AM till 12 Midnight. Do not think to sleep if you are hoteled up anywhere close.",
          "We took a walking tour in Copenhagen and one of the stopping points was in the Square outside the City Hall. Beautiful structure. Statue of the founding Bishop has in his hand a religious staff and a Sword, in gold colour",
          "We started our walking tour of Copenhagen from here. There is a free walking tour every day and it is for 3 hours. Google it and you will find it and it is very well conducted and worth it. You have to sign up before and show up on time. The building itself is impressive in its",
          "Whilst staying in Copenhagen I met my friends here and it is a good central point. The city hall itself is a great building and has interesting architecture - it hall inside when I visited wasn't so busy and neither was it outside",
          "We took a walk around the city hall, but nothing really impressive was here. There is a Clock room which is nice, but you really only get to view a large hall with statues (at least when we were here.... they seemed to be preparing for an event).",
          "We decided to visit the City Hall as we were staying right across the street. The building and the clock tower are awesome. We saw the clock museum/ exhibition inside. The square outside is also very nice.",
          "What a splendid building, you are allowed to wander upstairs and down corridors, delightful decorations round doors and windows and up the staircase. Lots of loos too so worth remembering when out sightseeing",
          "I passed by there a few times during my 3 days in Copenhagen as my hotel was closed by and I always took a few minutes to admire the place. Cant miss this building and this plaza if you visit the beautiful Danish capital.",

          "It is a beautiful old city hall and architecturally interesting. Nice photo stop. Wonderful music on the square. Free exhibits and clean bathrooms inside. Direct tot he right of the building is HC Andersen statue.",
          "A huge city hall building which has plenty of character and opposite tivolli park. The whole of Copenhagen has so much character within a small area.",
          "This richly decorated city hall is home to the Jens Olsen World Clock and the famous Dragon Fountain. Its at the heart of the city and is at close proximity to Stroget.",
          "One of the biggest and most interesting buildings in Copenhagen. Located in the centre of the city, surrounded by Tivoli Garden, Stroget quarter etc.",
          "City Hall is a large imposing building that you can't miss. Going inside is also a surprise. There is a magnificent clock just off the entrance and beautiful architectural details both inside and out. There is a tour up the tower which we didn't do, but some people we talked to",
          "Having been fortunate to visit several cities in Italy, Ravenna, Florence, Rome, Assisi, Bologna, Milan; Cologne Cathedral and lots of place sin France; I'm not that easily impressed. This place had the wow factor.",
          "The interior is very nice. The clock off the entrance is a very sophisticated item that one wonders how they designed such a complicated piece of machinery without the use of computers. The tower tour is a must do, but be warned. You MUST be in good shape to climb the stairs to",
          "located in the heart of the city. u can easily spot it while walking across the street. big building with some history. dont expect much, each european city has such a city hall.",
          "Hi, It's free to walk into Copenhagen City Hall and look around. Currently it houses Jens Olsen's World Clock and a \"One Stroke Calligraphy\" exhibit. Check it out before it's gone! I really liked it. Just before noon we were on our way out but noticed that there was a 30",

          "Did not go inside. Maybe should have. From the outdoors it is beautiful. If there are things going on in the square then a great place to spend some time, otherwise, good to see, spend a half hour and move on.",
          "World clock is amazing. Take the long walk up the tower..so worth the view of the city. You get a great view of Tivoli Gardens and all the major land marks.",
          "A great looking building architecturally and worth a visit when in Copenhagen. Free entry too makes it even more worthwhile.",
          "The world clock is an amazing piece of science history and mechanics. It's a must see and great value for free entrance.",
          "This was a very surprising fun adventure. Didn't realize how interesting the architecture and especially all the tile work were in this building. Loved all the stairs and various architectural details throughout the hall. Fun place we totally enjoyed it!",
          "Don't let the intimidating doorman put you off going inside. We were free to explore the entire place including the \"Wedding Room\" none of the couples there queuing for their civil ceremony seemed to mind us peeping inside. Amazing Grand Hall with it's balcony, fabulous murals .",
          "It was pretty, but the construction took away from the site. It was cool to see and it is a pretty building.",
          "Very central location close to shops and restaurants. An impressive building worth a few photographs. Particularly like the architecture.",
          "Enjoy a magnificent view of the city by climbing the tower. Regular visits twice a day - 11:00 and 14:00. It is worth the effort.",
          "We hadn't planned to go inside the Radhus, but a canal tour salesperson encouraged us to do so and we're glad he did. In addition to a famous clock in one of the ante rooms, the central space is awe inspiring with its glass ceiling, amazing brick and tile work and hanging Danish",
          "Not sure what there was to look at. Just a large building that is still in use. Seemed kind of strange to be a tourist and people were getting married at he same time.",
          "We visited for the tower your but found ourselves enjoying the architecture of this fantastic buildings as well. The world clock is really interesting and well worth a visit. The building is accessed through the main door on the square. The tower tour leaves at 11am and 1400.",
          "It's one of the few places that is completely free to visit. (There are also public restrooms here.) The World clock is displayed here and interesting to look at. When we visited, there was an art exhibition in the main hall.",
          "Not knowing if it would be opened or not, we got there and visited the small in-walled garden. Didn't find any doors opened for visitors. Admired the beautiful architecture! Close to a shopping street and square",
          "Opposite the city tower building there is a fantastic monument \"Ox killing dragoon\", across it the monument to great fairy-tales author, Hans Christian Andersson. You will find the place if you pass main railway station and Tivoli gardens on you right hand. It's also close to",
          "Although with a lot of building work happening in central Copenhagen this still offers a great photo and dominates the square.",
          "We did the tower to get our first view of Copenhagen and it was very impressive. You get to see a little of the inside which I thought was impressive but we mainly went for the tower and it was worth it.",
          "Copenhagen is a beautiful city where biking is king. Many historical buildings and City Hall is one of them that you should visit if not just stop for some good photos.",
          "The astronomical clock is amazing. The inside has some interesting paintings and is worth a hour of your time",
          "This is a very unimpressive building for a city hall and it is not possible to visit it from the inside. However, one can visit Jens Olsen's world clock which is of course a masterpiece. In fact it is not to be missed in Copenhagen.",

          "We liked the coty hall, because it was opened to public. We just could not find the viewing tower, because it was nlt marked anywhere. In the main hall there was some exhibition held.",
          "Recognised the interior from Danish TV series. Vast hall. Jens Olsen's World Clock can be seen there. Incidentally, it is refreshing that it is one of the tallest buildings around - not overshadowed by some ghastly skyscraper - long may that be the case.",
          "Step inside for free, but you may need to do online studies beforehand to appreciate the history and architecture. We enjoyed a local guide to tell us a bit about it on our walking tour.",
          "A large building with good architecture. The free areas are good to wander around, but you can't really go to too many different rooms. I'd say you could do the whole thing in an hour or so.",
          "While here in Copenhagen take a tour of this great landmark and you will be glad you did.well worth the price of admission",
          "Pretty to walk by and people watch. Close to Stroget. Lots going on in the area and a nice place to get a picture",

          "This is actually the 5th City Hall (I think) in Copenhagen as three of the previous ones had burned down and the fourth is being used as the courthouse. Although completed in the early 1900's, it's been built to resemble a Medieval building. Best of all were all the brides",
          "I walked by this like four times and then finally figured out what it was, I figured it must be something of national importance due to the design, but with older cities you just never know what they are currently used for. Great design, and awe inspiring as you see it on one",
          "It's one of the attractions you will get to see as it's located in the downtown area so make sure to check it out.",
          "Glamoring jewel of past architure that would directly catch your attention. Awesome historical artifacts.",
          "Across th street thre were drunks and drug addicts lying on benches and broken bottles around them. `Not unsafe but not something you expect to see near the city hall!!",
          "Definitely more riveting things to do in Copenhagen, but this is good if you're waiting for one of the free walking tours or looking for a private toilet around the city. The inside of he building is nice and warrants a photo or two, but that's about it.",
          "All walking tours etc start from here. It is just a busy town square. Quite an unremarkable place.There are markets in and around the place and some cheap and expensive eateries.",
          "The City Hall (Radhus) is an impressive building in the centre of Copenhagen, right on the expansive city square. It houses the Jens Olsen World Clock, which is why we visited. But we soon found there is more to the place than the clock (which is great and not to be missed).",
          "Well worth the visit. Easy to access as it is in the city square in the centre of the City Tells a lot at about Copenhagen and its history and events",
          "The Hotel we stayed at, Palace Hotel, is right across the street from the City Hall what a buzzing place at all times of the day. A lot of different activities in the weekend. A lot of the tours take off from this location. Right around the corner from Stroget. Lots of bicycle",
          "Radhuspladsen \u2013 the Copenhagen City Hall is Art Noveau Style. Highliht for the beautiful Jens Olsen's Worldclock. Free entrance and free toilets.",
          "The city hall is a very large impressive structure on the plaza in the center of the city. Many wonderful buildings and things to do all around the city hall.",
          "There is a small square outside the hall, good food moments can be had there. Inside is beautiful as told by my wife who went inside",
          "The building of the city hall is huge and beautiful. The architectural perfection of the place wooed us. The city hall houses the famous world clock made by Jens Olsen and also always have a temporary exhibit going on inside. There is a wide open area outside, where you find a",
          "This is an imposing and beautiful building situated in a large open area. I would recommend getting a tour inside the building if you get a chance. They have a lot of benches in the open courtyard around the building, so its a nice place to grab a sandwich and eat your lunch",
          "We popped in here, and it was a pleasant enough stop. There was an art exhibit and great architecture to oogle at. The library was closed but they have an exhibit on the world clock which was interesting.",
          "This massive brick building occupies one city block in downtown Kobenhavn. It is more than a hundred years old. Its clock tower rings every hour or more, and can be heard for a long way. Our hotel was across the street from City Hall so we dropped in. Its ground floor looks",
          "We were just walking by when we came across the city hall so decided to enter, it is free and is well worth a walk around. Lots of different rooms to visit in many a different decor.",
          "It's always nice to pop into a no admission, hassle-free historic building. With lovely features on the outside, the interior contains some hidden pleasures. While a guard is posted outside at the door, we climbed the stairs and wandered the hallways at our whim. Not sure if",
          "The City Hall in Copenhagen was directly across the street from our hotel, but we nearly missed seeing it -- had not idea what an artistic and historical treasure it is. The world clock itself, which is just inside the front entrance, is worth the visit, and the design, art, and",
          "The City Hall close to the main train station and Tivoli cannot be missed. It faces the big square where you will always find some performing artists and then you can enjpy the architecture of the building or go inside and explore it more.",
          "This is an enormous building with interesting architecture and a cavernous interior that was of mild interest. The rest of the area around had nothing of real interest and the main focus seemed to be the Tivoli Gardens across the way.",
          "The Radhaus was built in 1905 and is Copenhagen's town hall. It is the work of architect Martin Nyrop. The building's most iconic piece is the Jens Olsen's World Clock, designed by Jens Olsen (1872\u20131945) and built at a cost of one million kroner. Not only does it display local",
          "The City Hall is Nice with a Few Statues around it but the Overall General Area is Super to walk around. All flat and many other buildings and places to see. Then it makes the trip worthwhile.",
          "We wandered in here not expecting much, but the inside is truly lovely! Plus there was an art exhibit in the main hallway.",
          "Very nice architecture but not much to do in this area. There were some people playing the flutes in the square, but other than that not much. The amusement park is just opposite (Tivoli) which is probably more of an attraction so a simple drop by visit is good to see.",
          "City Hall in Copenhagen is located right across the street from Tivoli Gardens. It is an administrative building as well as a museum. On the day we visited, there was a posterboard display depicting Judaism through historical periods of time. This display was well thought out.",
          "We were just walking by when we came across the city hall so decided to enter, it is free and is well worth a walk around. Lots of different rooms to visit in many a different decor. The look from outside is as good as it is inside, well worth a look if your passing",
          "The building is nice and is situated right next to the theme park. There are plenty of bars and restaurants near for example the Hard Rock Cafe. There are several street entertainers. There is a lot of building work happening at the moment which spoils the scenery.",
          "It was our last day and we didn't want to do a walking tour in the pouring rain. So we took a quick walk to the Copenhagen City Hall. What a surprise! The building is beautiful. There are so many features to photograph. There was an art exhibit in the main room. Lots of",
          "Nice looking building from the outside but nothing extraordinary. There are more interesting places to see around town. Also, always very crowded around it with tourists and people who seem like just waiting to take advantage of the tourists (pickpockets).",
          "We only walked around the outside but it is really pretty. The clock works and chimes so you don't want a nearby hotel.",
          "Really Interesting architecture inside and especially outside City Hall. On each corner a different Bear is guarding the city. And below on the corners are game boards for citizens to use. Inside there is a museum that holds Jen Olsen's World Clock. They say as accurate as",
          "The Copenhagen City Hall is about as grand a sight as you would expect from the capital city of this small, but supremely confident country. The building itself is cavernous, with hundreds of rooms and offices and corridors that seem so long they have a vanishing point. Some",
          "This is an interesting building with a tower, that I believe you can go up in, but we did not do so. It is located on the edge of a square that also has the Scandic Palace Hotel on one side and construction is underway on another side. In this sure you can see street performers.",
          "We thought this would be interesting, it wasn't. We moved on after five minutes. People think it is special because it's the first building you hit when in Copenhagen from most hotels",
          "Copenhagen Town Hall is pretty central and you seem to pass it several times It was interesting architecture and worth stopping to look around Always seemed busy around the outside A wonderful building",
          "compared to US city halls, this one is elaborate and worth the time. There are tour available and they have much to add",
          "Well visiting the City hall in copenhagen is not something new. You can see a city hall everywhere in the european countries. The only nice thing to do, is visiting the clock tower where you see clearly copenhagen from top.",
          "copenhagen is full of historicist buildings (19th century buildings copying older styles, often a mish-mash of styles), but they are mostly brick and, despite their lack of design integrity and originality, they are more pleasing than the historicist architecture of some other",
          "Do yourself a favor and make a point of stopping by a most impressive time piece by Jens Olsen. Now wax all philosophical on just how many items in your daily life are dependent on the concept of time. By the way it is something we made up to help us explain what was going on",
          "This is one of the main traffic spots of Copenhagen and a great point of departure for your city walk. I'm not sure you can go inside the City Hall - but you should take a stroll around the building. Facing Tivoli you will find the H.C. Andersen statue and on the opposite site",
          "There always seemed to be something happening in the front square of the City Hall. We crossed this square about 8 times during our 2 day stay.",
          "Copenhagen City Hall is one of the tallest buildings in Copenhagen. Go inside and visit the ground and first floor if you have the time. The architecture is beautiful both in and outside this building. Don`t miss its hidden gem: the inner tiny, but beautiful garden! (see pics)",
          "Beautiful architecture in city centre. Adjacent to statue of Hans Christian anderrson. Buillt on a large square where entertainment e.g music, side shows is happening.Many restaurants and bars in this lively area",
          "This is quite a fascinating old city hall in a large city square, surrounded by a mix of old, slightly old, new, and really new buildings.",
          "Wonderful architecture and wall decorations. Being a phycologist, it was nice the see a city hall that is decorated by paintings of seaweeds.",
          "The iconic building of the city was inaugurated in 1905, designed in the Romantic style and inspired by the Siena City Hall. It dominates the central square and is a perfect opportunity for some great photos.",
          "This building can also be reviewed as Copenhagen City Hall. It is a typical, late 19c municipal building with little to recommend it. We found it to be a rather depressing sight.",
          "This building dates from the end of the 19c and is in a mock Gothic style. Consequently it is typical of many municipal building built around the same time. Apart from being big, it is nothing special and of little interest.",
          "Copenhagen City Hall dominates the Town Square, Radhuspladsen. A present there is some building work happening on one side of the square so it is half half the size it used to be. The clock here is also useful. It chimes every 15 minutes so if you are in the nearby Tivoli",
          "Nice place near tivoly gardens Nice restaurants near the square. Good location to start the visit. The dragon fountain et the square is the start of the free tour",
          "The great hall is rather plain and ugly, just big. The clock too technical for me. Good that it's free",
          "It was fun to explore this historic building. What is amazing is that is a modern functioning building for city government. The architecture and art inside were so interesting.",
          "In Baltic region, city hall is often one of the landmarks. It is not just for administration but also functional. The day I was there, the inside was setting up for a venue. Later in our visit, the outside square was set up for a concert. Copenhagen City Hall is simple but",
          "There were 2-3 guided tours per day in the afternoon. (Register at the visitors office, just by the front door.) Went through the banquet hall, mezzanine, interior corridors, the roof & tower. It was very windy at the top, even for August. On the way up, some genuine",
          "There is some fine architecture to see inside as well as outside and you are able to wander around the corridors of most of the building for free. The main hall sometimes has exhibitions on and you must visit the room containing Jens Olsen's World Clock.",
          "Interesting and impressive architectural stylings. Highlights for me were the tower and the World Clock. Took a tour of the building in English, which we were very grateful for as our whole family of 4 had not one word of Danish between us. The top of the tower offers some cool",
          "This is where we started our tour . Nice building and also its surrounding ones. There is a free toilet in front of it .",
          "This place is pretty big and has a crowded square in front of it. The architecture is interesting and appears old although I did not verify that. I liked walking around and looking at a lot of things in the city and in June it stays light until at least 1030pm so you can see a",
          "Different architecture, huge thick doors. A must see is the clock in a small room on the right inside the main entrance.",
          "What a surprise to get something for free! You have to wait for the lift - and there is a queue but the views from the top are excellent.",
          "The Copenhagen City Hall stands proudly on a busy street. The architecture is beautiful. It's close to major tourist sites.",
          "This civic building is quite impressive on the outside and the areas you're allowed to explore inside are interesting. There are some murals and decorations, but it's not as well decked out as the Oslo City Hall is.",
          "This is a real landmark building, which you can't miss when you traverse the city. It's easy to get to from the Metro and there is a great huzzle and buzzle about it. Worth taking a shot.",
          "As far as city hall building's go, this one is very impressive. Sitting right by the dragon fountain, not far from Tivoli, it really towers over the buildings around it. At any time of the day you'll see people getting married and milling around the main steps. It's quite a good",
          "Wonderful building and wonderful sight. At fixed time (in Sunday it was at 12:00) you can have a visit at the tower. All the time it is open you can have a visit of the building itself. From the tower you will have one of the best sights of the city.",
          "Right in the middle of the city. Lots of places to eat and plenty of indecent shops. Very busy but spacious.",
          "Enjoyed this city hall with its architecture and stain glass window. There was a kid's art exhibit when we were there.",
          "This building and its decorations are easily seen by walking. The architecture is worth worth photographing.",
          "What a truly magnificent building this is. Outwardly it looks more like a mini-castle with little emphasis on the mini! Inside it would compete with Cathedral, Castle or Stately home. When I visited a wedding was taking place. Unlike any City Hall I've seen in the past. Just"

          "Very nice square. It's large enough and comfortable. When we visited city, the square was being reconstructed. As I could understand a metro station must be built here. Lovely place and beautiful city Copenhagen.",
          "We went out in the evening, this time to the area near the City Hall which was very pretty and we found somewhere Sofia would actually eat.  The next morning we walked back to the square with the city hall in and did some photos then took a \u2026",
          "Good central meeting point.  Cheap eats can be hard to find in this city but I can recommend the hot dog kiosk outside City Hall.  Don't miss Hans Christian Andersen's Statue which is to the far left of the city hall main entrance.",
          "The city hall has a large plaza right outside that is suitable for chilling. The interior design of the city hall is spectacular too. There is no admission fee for the city hall. Definitely worth checking out.",

          "Great to see the whole square free of building sites. Now you can enjoy the entire space and have 360 views of the square. The entrance to the metro station is nicely integrated and there is also one side of the square with trees and benches where you can relax.",
          "Place with most important landmarks of Copenhagen around. You can visit Tivoli amusement park, Long Christmas market, Central train stations, and Canal nearby.",
          "Sooo lovely around Christmas time, really worth a wonder around. Food and drink places around are quite expensive, but reasonable when you consider you're in the centre of Copenhagen!",
          "It's a beautiful square and you can visit the city hall tower, it is included if you have the Copenhagen card. We saw the place inside, but unfortunately didn't go to the top of the tower. The lady that is working there informed us that we \u2026",

        "wiki": "The University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden (Danish: Botanisk have), usually referred to simply as Copenhagen Botanical Garden, is a botanical garden located in the centre of Copenhagen, Denmark. It covers an area of 10 hectares and is particularly noted for its extensive complex of historical glasshouses dating from 1874.\nThe garden is part of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, which is itself part of the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Science. It serves both research, educational and recreational purposes.\nThe identification code of the University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden as a member of the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI), as well as the initials of its herbarium is C.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The first garden: Hortus Medicus ===\n\nThe botanical garden was first established in 1600 but it was moved twice before it was ultimately given its current location in 1870. It was probably founded to secure a collection of Danish medicinal plants after the Reformation had seen many convents and their gardens abandoned or demolished.\n\nThe first garden, known as Hortus Medicus, was created on 2 August 1600 by royal charter on a piece of land donated by the king,  Christian IV. It was located in Skidenstr\u00e6de (now Krystalgade) and a residence for one of the professors of the university was also built at the site. It rested upon the professor in residence to maintain the garden, irrespective of which chair he held. In 1621 Ole Worm personally took over the responsibility for the garden and he enriched it with a great number of Danish medicinal plants as well as rare foreign species he received from his many professional contacts abroad.\n\n\n=== Oeder's Garden ===\nA second botanical garden was laid out by Georg Christian Oeder in 1752 in the newly founded Frederiksstaden district at the request of Frederik V at a site bisected by Amaliegade just north of Frederik's Hospital. The smaller western section, covering just under half a hectare, was equipped with a greenhouse while the eastern section remained largely unplanted. The garden was opened to the public in 1763.\nIn 1770 part of Oeder's Garden was put at the disposal of the University's botanical garden. The preceding year Christian VII had donated 2,500 thaler to the University, the interest from which would be used for the Botanical Garden. This had created the economical foundation for an enlargement but since there was no space for it at its original address, the off-site solution was ultimately opted for.Oeder became the Botanical Garden's first director. In order to emphasise its economic significance, as well as in the spirit of the Age of Enlightenment, he began a work in progress which was to become Flora Danica, an illustrated work describing all Danish and Norwegian plants. Oeder was fired in 1771 in connection with the Johann Friedrich Struensee affair.\n\n\n=== The Charlottenborg Garden ===\n \n \n\nIn 1778 both gardens were closed when the king reacquired the land at Amaliegade and at the same time donated a tract of land behind Charlottenborg Palace for the establishment of a new and larger botanical garden. Plans for this garden received royal approval on 22 July 1778. It was to have two directors, one appointed by the University and the other by the King. The first University appointment to this post was Christian Friis Rottb\u00f8ll, who had already managed the garden since Oeder's retirement, and the first royal appointment was Johan Theodor Holmskjold. At the same event, an associate professor was employed at the garden. The first to hold this chair was Martin Vahl, who played a large part in moving the plants from Oeder's Garden to Charlottenborg Garden.\nIn 1817, the model with a double directorship was abandoned when Jens Wilken Hornemann was made the sole director of the garden. At this stage the garden encompassed approximately 1.6 hectares in a low, waterlogged area that was bounded by Charlottenborg, Nyhavn, the Mint and Bremerholm. A main building was erected along the Nyhavn cabal, housing both a botanical museum, a library and residences for the director and a botanical gardener. There were also facilities for the storage of sensitive  plants during winter. The garden's first greenhouse, Guiones Koldhus  (Guione's Coolhouse), was erected in 1784. In 1803 the king funded of a new 200-square metre complex of greenhouses and nore were added in 1837.\nIn 1841 Joakim Frederik Schouw replaced Hornemann as director and the garden. Among his initiatives was the establishment of a new section dedicated to Danish species, holding 570 species, and improved cataloguing of plants and seeds. His tenure lasted until 1852. During this phase the garden became still more cramped and it became evident that another expansion was needed.\n\n\n=== The current garden ===\n\nThe botanical gardens got its current location in 1870. Four years later in 1874 the gardens got its large complex of glasshouses at the initiative of Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen who also funded it. His inspiration was that of the glass building the Crystal Palace that was erected for the Great Exhibition in London in 1851.In 1977 the gardens, including the greenhouses, became listed by Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces, the Danish conservancy authorities.\n\n\n== Copenhagen Botanical Garden today ==\nCopenhagen Botanical Garden is an informal garden with free admission. There are conservatories, a museum and herbarium, a library (admission by appointment only) a shop plants, seeds and a small selection of garden equipment and eating place.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe botanical gardens contain more than 13,000 species. The garden is arranged in different sections including: Danish plants (600 species), perennial plants (1,100 species), annual plants (1,100 species), rock gardens with plants from mountainous areas in Central and Southern Europe and Conifer Hill which is planted with coniferous trees. One of the newest inclusions is a rhododendron garden\nThe garden has many handsome specimen trees. The oldest tree in the gardens is a taxodium from 1806 that was moved along from the old location at an age of 60 years.\n\n\n== Glasshouses ==\n\nThe Gardens have 27 glasshouses. The most notable is the 3000-square metre conservatory complex from 1874. The Palm House at its centre is 16 metres tall and has narrow, cast-iron  spiral stairs leading to a passageway at the top. Plants include a palm from 1824 and a fine collection of cycads, some of which are more than 100 years old. A fifty metres long glasshouse house an extensive collection of cacti and other succulents whilst another one houses orchids and begonias. A modern glasshouse is dedicated to caudiciforms. The garden also has a special air-conditioned greenhouse that can re-create environments suitable for Arctic plants.\n\n\n=== The Palm House ===\nHere is the list of some plant species growing at the Palm House:\n\n\n== Museum and seed bank ==\nThe university's botanical museum and herbarium are housed in a building situated within the garden, giving the garden staff ready access to reference works and more than 2 million dried plant specimens.\n\n\n== Surrounding buildings ==\n\n\n=== Social Sciences Faculty Library ===\nLocated at 140 Gothersgade, the building was designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and built from 1888 to 1890 as botanical Laboratory. It is a Historicist building inspired by Italian palazzi, a style which Herholt had previously relied on in his now demolished National Bank at Holmens Kanal. The building has housed the faculty library of the Faculty of Social Sciences since 2011.\n\n\n=== Institute of Psychology ===\nInstitute of Psychology, at 2A \u00d8ster Farimagsgade, is based in a building which was built in 1957 to the design of Kai Gottlob for the Institute of Biology at University of Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Public art, monuments and memorials ==\n\nIn 1909 to 1911, Carl Jacobsen installed a number of casts of classical statues in the garden.\n\n\n== See also ==\nParks and open spaces in Copenhagen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial webpage\nHistory and restoration, pdf about the garden\nSource - Nyhavn",

          "The Botanical gardens is a beautiful place to sit and relax. We took a picnic and sat just above the lake admiring the view and relaxing in the sunshine. The gardens include a wonderful rockery and have a lovely undulating feel to them. We didn't even get as far as going into",
          "It's a nice place but can't say I was impressed. It gave me the impression that it was not that well kept. To be fair there was quite a bit construction going on and the butterfly exhibition lacked in butterflies. The park around it was more interesting. I went in April when",
          "Lovely gardens to have a relaxing walk around or even sit down and have lunch. The entry is free which is great for how nice the gardens are. We paid to visit the palm house and the butterfly house which were reasonable prices and definitely worth it as we spent a while in both.",
          "It's free to walk through the gardens, but you\u2019ll need a ticket for the Palm and Butterfly houses! The Butterfly house was so much fun with so many flying species flying around. I was not a fan of the Palm house fashioned after the Worlds Fair since it was just a bit too humid,",
          "A great place to relax and walk through beautiful gardens just outside the center of Copenhagen. The city has really done a great job in developing and maintaining this garden, which is quite large and very well done. Beautify to see and a great break from being a tourist if",
          "Free to enter, adm for palm house and butterfly house (unless you have copenhagen card, included). Well woth a visit, as good as Kew Gardens in London, minus the cost. Location is easy, combine it with Rosenborg Castle and Kunst Museum for a full day visit.",

          "We highly recommend visiting the gardens for a couple of hours, especially if you are into nature. The gardens are very well maintained, very inviting and easy to reach - right in the center of Copenhagen. You can then spend some time inside the historical glasshouses dating",
          "Only had time for s quick walk round the gardens and then went into the Butterfly House and Palm House, which cost \u00a314.50 for two adults. Butterfly house was lovely as they were fluttering everywhere, we even had them land on us. The palm house was really good but so hot, palms",
          "The botanical gardens are a brilliant place to visit on a nice sunny day, we enjoyed walking around the various paths. The site itself is quite large so it took some time, which was fine with us. When we got to the famous glass house (Palm House) we bought our ticket, this",
          "This place is well worth a visit, in the heart of Copenhagen you find this little garden, free to enter and a nice place to take a break or maby a picnic, The butterfly house is almost a must if you are her, 60kr to come in, but then you get entrees to the palme house also.",
          "The gardens are truly lovely and very well maintained. The lake gives the place a tranquil feel. The danish beer garden is interesting as is the glasshouse. People tend to simply sit anywhere and enjoy their lunch break or have family picnics.",

          "So many of the sites in Copenhagen are busy with tourists that it was great to find this oasis so close to our hotel and on our last morning of the holiday. It's aso free to wander about in which was a bonus. Nearly all the shrubs and trees had a label as to their botanical",

          "The Butterfly House is part of the Botanical Garden in center of Copenhagen and situated in its own greenhouse under the big 'Palmehuset'. It was amazing and very relaxing to walk through the greenhouses with the butterflies flying around us. A fee is charged for entrance (DKK",
          "Although it was a warm day and inside was even warmer, I was so happy we decided to go. Very pretty, well entertained and the butterfly house is so gorgeous. If you\u2019re in doubt, don\u2019t hesitate and just go for it. The park surrounding it\u2019s free and beautiful as well.",
          "If you're looking to relax within the city, there's free access to the Botanical Gardens, which is not at all far from Rosenborg Castle. We did have included access to the Palm House and the Butterfly House with the Copenhagen Card (i.e. entry is not free, though it is one fee",

          "This park is across from the Rosenborg Castle. Its a great place to spend a quiet afternoon. There is an extensive collection of plants from around the world in the greenhouse. Its a great place for a rainy day visit. It is part of the Copenhagen card program.",
          "Enjoyed wandering through the park area, quiet oasis in the middle of the city. A shame the glasshouse was fenced off and part of the gardens as well for remedial work, this looks like it could take a while to be done. it also means one of the main entrances is closed. It is",
          "We really liked this place. It\u2019s relaxed and clean. You can sit everywhere. Enjoy a lovely park. The green house is small but lovely. Spending an hour here with teenagers is enough. Great break between the museums.",
          "If you are in the area then would definitely recommend having a stroll through these gardens. They are so well kept and full of lovely plants and quaint little areas to explore. We went at the start of May so some of the flowers hadn't quite bloomed yet but I bet is summer this",
          "These are just outside the city centre and are super cute. They're free to enter and worth a walk round especially in the sun. We loved the lake and they have a big butterfly house you can get entry too. Close to the city centre and another wee park so worth a walk around.",
          "The Palm House in the Copenhagen Botanic Garden is magical. It even has a tiny mangrove swamp. on a winter's day it is toasty and warm. The plant specimens tower above and are accessible by an elevated walkway. Step access only. All the plants are very healthy. There are streams",
          "Not an overwhelming botanical garden and you can't go in the greenhouses, but if you just want a stroll or picnic in a pretty place this will do the trick!",
          "Certainly worth a look but I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend paying for the butterfly house or the palm house unless you know you\u2019ll want to see it. They were ok and we don\u2019t regret paying but have seen better.",
          "This was a lovely garden and tropical greenhouse, however I live near Kew Gardens and this pales a little in comparison. If you're in Copenhagen, it's worth a visit to have a look around but, if you've been to Kew, don't expect tobe blown away.",
          "A Peaceful Oasis in the middle of the city. Nice place to eat your lunch pack or sit and relax watching the ducks. There is a small cafe and you can walk around in the big tropical greenhouse. Right next to Norreport Station in the heart of the city. If you cross the street",

          "This is a gem! Many flowers and very nice premises. Entrance is free to relax in the gardens, but payment needed for the Palm house and butterfly houses. Very nice get away spot of the buzzing streets and great combination with Rose castle",
          "Nice gardens, a lovely huge rockery to explore, climb around. A very nice large glasshouse (tickets to enter Palm House and we didn't... but it looks great). Plenty of benches to sit and relax and look at the small lake. Shade too if you need it.",
          "I visited alone there, the enter is free. I saw too much kinds of plants inside of the building. If you would like to trip outside, you will see there also a lot of kinds of plants and the amazing lake.",
          "This was an outstanding location. I am not normally a \"gardens\" type person but I am so glad that I went. I had finished seeing some of my morning locations early and thought this would be a great spot to sit and have a snack... I ended up walking and sitting in the gardens",
          "We seem to visit botanical gardens wherever we go and this was one of the best we have been to. The botanical gardens 'bit' is set within a much larger park, which must be stunning in Spring and Summer. Even in March it was lovely (but cold). This is a good attraction to tie",

          "We used our Copenhagen card to visit and it was so worth it. The gardens before the greenhouses were amazing on their own but the greenhouses were packed of plants. There were tiny little black and red frogs making such a lovely sound. The succulents were absolutely beautiful.",
          "Could do with a tidy up, think the university uses this park for botanical study. Nicer parks and gardens throughout Copenhagen.",

          "We visited the Botanical Gardens during our city break in March and I must admit I really enjoyed the hour or so that we spent there. We never visited the Palm House, which was an outstanding construction, but we spent our time walking around the many pathways in the grounds.",
          "The Botanical Gardens is worth a visit. Travelled in march, but I still liked it. The Palm House was nice and warm. In the summer it must be a very beautiful place to visit.",

          "probably very nice in the spring , as always with Denmark \"clean and tidy \" . the entrance is free which was refreshing",
          "I don't usually visit botanical gardens, but I enjoyed this one. It's located in the city center, and offers a nice, green break from the city sightseeing. It's worth the price and takes about an hour to walk through. There was additional information about some of the trees and",
          "The glass house (very big) has a high walkway , giving you a \u201ctree top\u201d view of a variety of plants. We visited in Feb\u201919 so the warm temperature inside was very pleasant (zero outside) . The cactus house was interesting , especially the spikey ones.",

          "From mangrove swamps to desert palm this is a truly beautiful structure and experience. Almost hidden in the heart of CPH it makes a great winter breather and a fresh spring break. The gardens are ample with plenty of colour and space, great for the children and in the hot",
          "We rented bikes from the hotel and biked to the gardens. It was difficult to find the entrance because they were doing road work. We ended up circling the entire block and walking part of it so we could push our bikes on the sidewalk. The entrance is off the corner of the",
          "What a wonderful place to visit in Copenhagen (especially when you feel like hiding from the rain for a bit). We went to the Botanisk Have to see the park surrounding it as well as to check out the Palm House and greenhouses with cactuses etc. and it was all brilliant! Much",
          "We visited when it was cold, but it is a lovely walk round the gardens and the botanical gardens are great. We have never seen so many varieties of plants before. Plus, it was good to get out of the cold into the humid gardens.",

          "We had a lovely afternoon walking around the botanical gardens. They boast 10 hectares and 27 glasshouses in the centre of Copenhagen. There's not much to do other than walk around the grounds so if the weather is bad, may be worth missing.",

          "Beautifull botanical garden... but in the cold winter, it's rather the warm green house that is nice to visit. Lots of Cactus, a possibility to climb to the top of the green house. If you are lucky, you will even see that buterflies and tiny frogs are living there ;-)",
          "We visited very early in the morning in December so had the gardens to ourselves. The paths meander around the gardens past many Greek statues. There is also a beer garden but does not sell pints of beer but rather the plants that flavour beer are grown in rows. The Palm House",
          "Right before coming to Copenhagen I was in Gothenburg, Sweden and went to their Palm House. First, it's free, and second, it made me a little biased because I positively loved it there! All that to say, I wasn't blown away by the Palm House here. It could have been the time of",

          "You can walk around the gardens for free so it\u2019s worth having a quick look around and stroll around the lake. The palm house looks good so it makes for some nice pictures. You will have to pay an entrance fee for that though.",

          "Visited this place by chance, while walking down from Torvehallerne market to Rosenborg castle. Was very beautiful with lot of collection of plants, cacti and succulents. Entree is free to the park in general, but a paid entrance to a Palm/cactus greenhouse inside. The park in",

          "We thought the gardens were just a free, pretty green space. Which they are, with a lake and large rockery. But they are also an extension of the natural history museum and soon to be the main site for such - construction underway till 2019, use the N\u00f8rreport entrance. We",
          "Very appealing place to visit as the Botanisk Have is completely free. We found the collection of plants inside the botanical greenhouse itself not that special but together with its surrounding gardens, it is more than worth the (little) detour.",
          "No matter where I travel to, I always visit the closest botanical garden and the one in Copenhagen absolutely took my breath away. The diversity of species was fantastic, the building was gorgeous and the people we spoke to that work there where friendly and very helpful. Other",

          "Some of the plants are several hundred years old. Amazing. Be sure to visit the butterfly house- so beautiful!",
          "This place is a cross between a mini Kew Gardens and a mini Central Park. There are little areas to investigate and most things are labelled. The palm house is nice and worth a look, you need to pay to get in but there is a lot to look at. You can go upstairs in the big dome and",

          "Well laid out gardens in the centre of Copenhagen. Look out for the turtles in the Lake. Visit the Palm House too to see the butterflies, although there snow an entrance fee. Good place to idle away an hour.",
          "Perhaps it's better in the spring. In September, it is good for an after lunch sroll in the sunshine. There are ponds and birds, expansive lawns, winding paths, a rock garden, greenhouses, butterfly house (charge), benches. Think large park.",
          "This is an excellent well laid out garden. There are lots of pathways surrounded by trees and rockeries. The butterfly house is well worth a visit but you will have to pay an admission price.",
          "They were already closing the garden shop when we arrived, and it became apparent that we got here too late in the day to see as much of the garden as we would have liked. It was probably less than 30 minutes after we arrived that they started clearing the garden out for closing",
          "There is a current exhibit and garden devoted to plants and herbs used in making beer. I believe most would find this interesting. The paths around the pond feature interesting sculptures. The conservatory is large and rather charming. The flower gardens on the west side of",

          "Visited the gardens on a sunny afternoon, how tranquil the experience was. The variety and beauty of the flora and fauna was a wonderful sight. The beer garden, no it\u2019s not what you think, was very informative and interesting. The beer garden has a variety of plants, including",
          "The butterfly house was OK but you have to first get tickets in the main building (with the dinosaurs) that is quite a walk. So in general this was not much fun in the sweltering heat.",
          "Amazing collection of plants, the palm house is stunning and absolutely awe inspiring. They have a butterfly house too. It is 60kr each but less if you\u2019re a student . Relax in the deck chairs afterwards and watch the giant koi from the bridge too.",
          "Not much to see here. Grounds weren\u2019t well maintained, not much in bloom (been though flowers were in bloom in other parts of the city). Flowers were prettier in Tivoli Gardens.",
          "Lovely gardens and the Butterfly House was wonderful. Also loved the Palm House - with a variety of climates and associated plants. The Butterfly House told you which butterflies were in the house - and then left it to you to find them which was great fun. Lots of photos!",

          "My daughter loves visiting botanical gardens and so off we went. Butterfly house was fascinating and the palm house was good. We had been to Kew in London a few weeks earlier and this one isn't as big or impressive but is still worth a visit. Loved the deck chairs and seating",

          "Not the best place to go on a super-hot day but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Went straight to the butterfly house and then on to the Palm house. Nearly missed the latter as doors are very stiff and we thought it was closed. Lots of amazing butterflies and plants, including some",

          "Amazing one, a quiet park, but just within a few minutes walk to the centre of the city, at the opposite of Rosenborg Castle, and University of Copenhagen. We relaxed very much walking around in the park. How wonderful that you could sit near the lake and enjoyed summer breeze.",
          "These gardens are peaceful and very beautiful. The butterfly house is worth seeing and there are also dinosaurs in the grounds which would interest younger children.",
          "We hiked uphill in a heat wave and arrived at a multiple-domed structure. Upon entry, made a rapid exit - it was like entering a turkish bath! Our travel companions did go through the exhibit and reported that the \"greenhouses\" includes specimens from around the world. We",

          "The Botanical Gardens are really pretty. When I visited, the greenhouses were closed, sadly, but the rest of the gardens are still worth seeing. We were lucky that so many flowers were in bloom and we visited on a beautiful warm day. It's a great walk that isn't a time",
          "May this year just didn't seem the the right month for flowers in bloom. We missed the early varieties and were too early for summer ones. Most of the greenhouses were also closed so we didn't bother to spend much time there.",
          "Mid May was an ideal time to visit as most of the rhododendrons and peonies were in bloom with lovely vibrant colours. For the price of admission (free) you can't beat this opportunity to stretch your legs and connect with nature in the middle of the busy city.",

          "This place is absolutely gorgeous. It's a nice and quiet place to walk around and relax. I'll take you about an hour to see everything. You can also take your time and just walk around. It's free so definitely worth a visit.",
          "Lovely gardens, lots of walking paths. Right in the middle of the city, so easy access but still a nice escape to nature. Conservatory is a really pretty building, very warm and humid inside. Spiral staircases inside are very popular photoshoot spots (for good reason).",

          "A must-go in Denmark, especially during warmer weather. We went around mid-April during a warmer day. The greenhouse is the highlight of the park with a good collection of exotic tropical plants. It is similar to the greenhouse in Kew Gardens in London, except that it's free!",

          "The Botanical Gardens were created on the old moats and ramparts and laid out as gardens in the 1870\u2019s with a lake and lawns and flowerbeds. It has a fine glass conservatory with palms and tropical plants and many copies of ancient statues in the grounds. It is free of charge",
          "A very beautiful part of the city that is easy to find and close to several other attractions. The grounds are full of botanical delights and fantastic palm house. With a large park it would make a great spot to picnic (we visited in January and it was cold!)",
          "Good spot to take photos.. The glasshouse was the best part! Be sure to explore the surroundings around the lake",
          "After visiting the Rosenborg Castle, we crossed the busy road to the Botanical Gardens. As we were there in late autumn, the garden beds were at the end of there flowering best, but the layout of the place with the central lake and arbours were lovely.",

          "If you are in the area then going for a walk through the garden is definitely worth it. The highlight of the garden is the Palm House (a massive glass greenhouse). This is a great place to relax and escape the city for a bit.",
          "This is one of the prettiest botanical gardens I have visited. Lots of walking paths, bridges, ponds, rivers, etc. There is a huge greenhouse but we did not go inside. We did not have to pay to walk around the garden.",
          "The botanical gardens in Copenhagen are well worth a visit. It\u2019s a beautiful, tranquil place to walk, and to sit. The gardens are very well maintained, and they have information about the different plants if you\u2019re into that. The Palm House is absolutely worth a visit- check",
          "Went here with no expectations and was really surprised about what was here. Really cool seeing many different kind of plants in the middle of Copenhagen.",
          "I went in autumn during the cold orange falling of the leaves. It is really nice as you get the autumn view with a tropical garden inside not to far from the palace as well. Holds a special place in my heart. Free entry when I went and good for a afternoon or morning trip not to",

          "Our first visit to Copenhagen saw us exploring much of the city on foot. One long walk took us to the Rosenborg Palace. While heading to the palace, we took the opportunity of a lengthy stroll through the Botanical Gardens. Unfortunately, the weather was not very kind to us as",

          "What a beautiful and peaceful place this is. Just to wander around the paths and sit on the grass or many benches, even at the end of September, makes the day. The climb to the top of the greenhouse is a must. And its all free",
          "the botanical gardens was a massive highlight in my trip to copenhagen, such beautiful sights, you could easily spend hours there like i did, me and my friends took a piknik and ate it on a bench there. The green house is beautiful too HOWEVER it is SO SO HOT!! (obviously, it's",
          "A comparatively large park, with luscious greeneries you can feast your eyes. They have greenhouses with fascinating plants and flowers of different varieties. A walk in the garden was refreshing, serene and calming. The garden is wonderfully kept, clean and well-maintained.",
          "The garden is a lovely setting with many paths and buildings. As you may encounter a rainy day as we did, do not let that stop you from going there. The plant filled green houses are warm inside and there is much to see. There is even a catwalk above the plant collections so you",

          "Nice walk around the park, but nothing spectacular on display. The large glass house was impressive, but we couldn't enter due to works. Some nice ponds and statues but again nothing amazing or ground breaking in terms of being a botanical garden. Train station was just down",
          "It was relaxing to walk through the garden. Nature is so relaxing, green everywhere, you don't have a feeling that you are in the city center. It was raining when I visited and Greenhouse was closed, but there is a lot to see in the garden if you have time to explore it all.",
          "It is a well maintained park in the city center. Not too many trees (more open area like green fields, flowers etc.). Depends on the time of the year you can enjoy plants. Something I would not recommend as a goal by itself but if you are nearby - add it to your walk. It can be",

          "Incredibly you do not feel that you are in a Capital City. It was during summer period and the weather was warm with some drizzle patches of rain. Yet it was still very enjoyable to walk around and see the Gardens. Location within town is ideal. Worthwhile a visit.",

          "Lovely way to spend a sunny afternoon . Greenhouses were open and casual food and drink on the patio was delightful.",

          "An easy walk from the Rosenborg Palace so we visited it the same day. I couldn't stress enough on how beautiful the garden was. Just as beautiful as the Botanical garden in Geneva- and that's saying something! A must visit!",
          "It is more a park than a garden, the space is open and inviting. You are downtown but feel miles away from the city. A great place to enjoy a sunny day",

          "The Botanical Gardens were a lovely way to spend a couple of hours surrounded by beautiful trees, plants, and water. The fact that it was free made it even better and after a slightly stressful time over the road queueing and being a bit disappointed with Rosenborg, this was a",
          "not that big a garden to wander around, nice benches and view as you'd expect. some areas are turned over to wild life gardening so its not all pristine, good for a 10 minute wander or use the cafe by the greenhouses.",
          "Lovely greenhouses with amazing plants -look for the insect eating plants- they keep them behind glass in England! Climb the spiral staircase to the top of the central greenhouse for a tree top view of the greenery. Look for the turtles in the lake and sunning themselves on",
          "I did visit the botanical gardens a few years ago, and have a feeling it has lost a bit of its greatness during the years. The palm-house are still great, but parts of the gardens looked a bit neglected. Still: If you are tired of waiting in line for the Rosenborg castle, cross",
          "I was not really impressed by the gardens. Quite large area but still you never really get away from the noise of the traffic. Easy to find a bench if you need a rest. Large pond. Some plants in the palm house were infested with ants. Very few blooming flowers in the garden,",
          "We really enjoyed our walk through the different areas of the gardens. There is a perennial, annual and rock garden; along with pretty lakes & bridges. There are also benches scattered along the paths, but it is prohibited to walk on the grass or being dogs inside. The nice",

          "The botanical gardens look like those from a Disney-movie. Great place to take a stroll or sit down and read a book (or watch other tourists). Take a climb in the glass house, the view is worth it.",
          "Went here before the places and museums opened. It is open on mondays when most of the places are closed. If you like gardens then this will suit",
          "I went there with absolutely no research on the place, and thus also had no idea about what to expect. The first good sign that I got was that there was absolutely no entrance fee. After I went in, the place is green and unspoilt. There is huge open spaces of grass (perfect for",

          "There were some lovely areas but other bedding areas were bare other than weeds. I know it was free and quite early in the season (May), but it would have been nice if it had looked a little more cared for. A glass house was quite nice - don't expect Wisley and you may not be",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Copenhagen Opera House (in Danish usually called Operaen, literally The opera) is the national opera house of Denmark, and among the most modern opera houses in the world. It is also one of the most expensive opera houses ever built with construction costs well over US$500 million. It is located on the island of Holmen in central Copenhagen.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe foundation A.P. M\u00f8ller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney M\u00f8llers Fond til almene Formaal donated the Opera House to the Danish state in August 2000.  (Arnold Peter M\u00f8ller  (1876\u20131965) was a co-founder of the company now known as M\u00e6rsk). Some politicians were offended by the private donation, in part because the full cost of the project would be tax deductible, thus virtually forcing the government to buy the building; but the Folketing and the government accepted it in the autumn of 2000.Architect Henning Larsen (1925\u20132013) and engineers Ramboll and Buro Happold and theatre consultant Theatreplan designed the facility. The acoustics were designed by Arup Acoustics and Speirs and Major Associates designed the architectural lighting.  A.P. M\u00f8ller had the final say in the design of the building, however, adding steel to the glass front, among other things. Construction began in June 2001 and was completed on October 1, 2004. It opened on January 15, 2005, in the presence of  shipping magnate  M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller (1913\u20132012), Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Queen Margrethe II. The tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo made a gala guest appearance as Sigmund in Wagner's Die Walk\u00fcre on April 7, 2006, in a production by Kasper Bech Holten) and attended by The Queen.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Opera is located in Copenhagen just opposite the main castle Amalienborg, home of the Danish royal family, at the shore of the harbour. The opera house is built in alignment with Amalienborg and Frederik's Church ( Frederiks Kirke), popularly known as the Marble Church (Marmorkirken)  so that if one stands in the main entrance of the Opera, one can see the Marble Church over the water along the road through Amalienborg. The specific part of the island where the Opera was built is named Dok\u00f8en, which means the Dock Island. Just a few meters west of the opera, one can still see an old dock and a pumping station.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe house is administered by the Royal Danish Theatre and is one of the best-equipped in the world.  It has a main stage with five other stages directly connected, where large setups can be moved easily in and out. The theatre can seat between 1492 and 1703, depending on the size of the orchestra. The 1492 seats are all individually angled in order to provide the best experience.\nThe orchestra pit is one of the largest in any opera house, with room for 110 musicians; the structure provides excellent sound quality for the orchestra. If the pit is filled, some musicians are located just below the front of the stage, which has become controversial among some members of the orchestra (according to tour guides in 2005), because this increases the sound levels, beyond those acceptable in Denmark. However, the overhang is very slight and the authorities have permitted this to happen.\nDuring construction of the theatre, some acoustic tests were carried out with the fire curtain in place while technical work was carried out on stage, but great consideration was given to balance between pit and stage.  If the orchestra is small or absent, the pit can be covered and additional seats can be added to the auditorium.\n\nJust like the old Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, The Queen has her own box on the left side of the auditorium, closest to the stage. \nThe foyer has been designed for comfort, based on behavioural research on opera goers maximizing the wall area for standing against, while still providing views across the entire foyer and one of the best views on Copenhagen.\nGuided tours cover most of the building, including both the auditorium and backstage areas.\n\n\n== Takkelloftet ==\nBesides the main stage, the building also includes a small stage for experimental theatre, a so-called \"black box\" theatre called Takkelloftet. It was named after the original Takkelloftet, a building just south of the Opera 280 meters long and built between 1767 and 1772 for storing ropes for the navy. Thus the opera maintains a connection to the marine history of its location.Everything on the stage and in the audience area is totally black, and the audience seats can easily be removed in order to make the room much easier to configure for alternative setups. There are up to approximately 200 seats for this stage. Takkelloftet has its own foyer. In this room, some of the walls are decorated using the same Jura Gelb limestone as outdoor. These stones are mounted on the wall in a way that makes it possible to use the stone plates as a kind of music instrument just by knocking on them with bare hands.\n\n\n== Backstage ==\nThe Opera has 6 main stages: 1 visible for the audience, and 5 for rehearsals and set preparation. It has almost everything needed for opera, ballet etc., including stage elevators, movable ballet floors, etc. The building totals 41,000 m\u00b2 and has 14 floors, of which 5 are below ground. It contains more than 1000 rooms, including a large orchestral rehearsal room. Despite its luxurious equipment, there are only approximately 1500 seats because a larger number of seats would hamper the quality of sound.\nUnlike the old opera in Copenhagen, the artists are allowed to take the elevator from their dressing room to the stage, because of their reliability. However, the dressing rooms are farther from the stage, making it almost impossible to return for quick costume changes.  Designers did not account for this, but stagehands have solved this problem by constructing temporary dressing rooms near the main stage for quick changes of clothes or makeup.\nThe building makes it possible to go outside on the top floor, but it is only possible to walk comfortably at the south side of the building (opposite to the entrance). The employee canteen is located in this area, isolated from public view.\n\n\n== Architecture, art and decoration ==\n\nThe building was designed by architect Henning Larsen in close and often problematic collaboration with M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller. M\u00e6rsk wanted the building to have several features in its design: it would not become obsolete in function and appearance due to any fiscal compromise. He personally tested seats and materials, he visited many places in the world to see how opera buildings were constructed and how the building materials were looking after having been exposed over time to weather. Henning Larsen, on the other hand, was trying to make sure that the original architectural ideas were carried through the construction process, especially concerning the large glass surface front, which became a matter of great controversy and subsequent compromise.The building exterior is faced with Jura Gelb, a beige limestone quarried in Germany. It is situated on ground that is surrounded by canals that are designed to give the impression the structure is on an island. The bridges constructed to access the building were made from oak trees originally planted in the 19th century for use in replacing the national fleet that was lost with the bombardment of Copenhagen in September 1807. The front of the building was originally designed with large glazing panels in order to see the shell of the auditorium from the harbor side. However, M\u00e6rsk emphasized that glass does not age well, so the fa\u00e7ade was changed to a metal grid.The foyer floor is Sicilian Perlatino marble. The central foyer holds three spherical chandeliers created by the Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson. Each chandelier consists of several pieces of glass, which are semipermeable allowing some light to pass, and some to reflect.  The patterns change when viewed from different angles. Designer and artist  Per Arnoldi designed the logo for the opera, visible in the marble floor just inside the entrance.  Painter and sculptor Per Kirkeby (1938\u20132018) created four bronze reliefs for the wall to the auditorium, just below the maple wood part. Per Arnoldi also designed the Front curtain for the main stage, made of multiple color threads creating a three-dimensional effect, that does not reproduce well in photographs.The rear wall of the foyer and balcony faces are maple. The architects' original intention was to make the wood look like that from an old violin.  However using the same technique would have been far too expensive. Instead, they have tried to imitate the color using more traditional staining techniques, and the result is very close (the official homepage says differently, but the guides in the Opera tell this story). Due to the orange color and its form, it is suitably known by locals as the pumpkin.\nThe auditorium ceiling is gilded with about 105,000 sheets of almost pure carat (100%) gold leaf.\nThe floor in the main auditorium is smoked oak. The balcony faces have been designed with openings in a special pattern to improve sound quality, and LED-based lighting that can be illuminated in a variety of patterns.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nRoute 903 of the Copenhagen Harbour Buses shuttles between Nyhavn and the Opera from 7-23 from Monday-Friday and from 10-23 on weekends. The opera is also served by Harbour Buses Routes 901 & 902, connecting it to various other points along the harbourfront.  Route 66 connects the Opera House to the Central Station. As of 2015, the end station of bus 9A is Operaen as well.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n360 degree panorama of the Copenhagen Opera House\nHenning Larsen's homepage about the Opera\nA description of the construction project\nNew Copenhagen Opera House at Structurae\nA.P.

The sound inside the opera was very good and the play \u2018The Barber of Seville\u2019 was fantastic. I am rating 3 stars due to the restaurant and bars. The show",
          "Went here for the openning night of Carmen. The place itself is beautiful, the seats are not so convenient, and the production itself was impressive, albeit not in the level of the production you get to see in Rome.",
          "Well worth a good look, absolutely amazing.No rough edges here, just a spectacular masterpiece.A fine example of architecture.",
          "The Copenhagen Opera House (in Danish usually called Operaen, literally The opera) is the national opera house of Denmark, and among the most modern opera houses in the world. It is also one of the most expensive opera houses ever built with construction costs well over US$500",
          "the architectural ensemble when looking from the Nyhavn bridge is great, modern art buildings mingle up with the Nyhavn and others. When you get closed to the opera, you notice the sheer size of roof and place. Definitely worth to stand there and lookout.",
          "Worth a quick stop intersting design, apparently you can walk on the roof and they have annual events jumping off that roof into the water!",
          "We saw the opera house from the water and our tour guide said that sometimes they have jumping contests from the roof.",
          "Our first impression of the Opera House was almost \"star treky\" and didn't quite fit in the surroundings. Although, once we understood the history and expectations on the architect, felt we should be less generous with our criticisms. It was largely funded by the shipping",
          "This is a spectacular building for the city. A beautiful sight to behold no matter what angle you come at it from. It domineers the landscape in such a beautiful way, it really is a sight to behold and definitely considered a 'main attraction' on any trip.",
          "Copenhagen has two opera houses. The old one was built in 1874 and is located by the Kongens Nytorv square. The new opera is located across the canal. It was inaugurated in January 2005. You can have guided tours in both houses. We have seen performances once in the old house",
          "I walked by it numerous times but never went in. It is stunning and worth a little walk especially if you've been at Nyhavn.",
          "We had planned to do a tour of this building but in the end couldn\u2019t get a reservation for the day we needed. We did, however, see it up close when we did the canal tour. It\u2019s a beautifully sleek modern building that sets it apart from the many older classic buildings nearby. I",
          "This is a wonderful piece of Nordic architecture. We enjoyed it both from the water and also from land. It is an icon for the city.",
          "The Opera House was not open for tours the day we were in town. But we did walk around the grounds and it's impressive. It's more modern than many of the old European Opera housing which i prefer.",
          "An outstanding achievement in Nordic architecture, guided tour was a treat! Area next to opera is also a very nice walk, across the river from the Castle.",
          "Went with the family. Took the ferry. I booked online in England. The building is amazing and despite being in the Gods, we had a great view. I would thoroughly recommend it as something different to do for an evening.",
          "We saw this building just from this distance like you see in the photo and it was no so interesting to see it closely...",
          "We cruised by it on the river cruise and were able to walk around it when we got off the cruise and walking to the hop on hop off bus stop.",
          "We booked a 1 hour tour of the Opera House at their website. The building is amazing! We saw the theater and all of the backstage planning that goes into a production. The view of the Royal Palace and the Marble Cathedral are just beautiful. With every minute!",
          "This was once a very controversial addition to Copenhagen's harbor, but now considered a landmark. Once a year they hold a diving competition off the roof!! Wish we had been here for that.",
          "A dramatic edifice and very busy. We did not get a tour because we had no reservation. Please note: Make reservation! We climbed atop the Opera House for a great view of the harbor",
          "We went to see performances of Turandot and Tosca. The former was not very good, lots of technical wizardry but the singing by the leads was poor. Tosca was a lot better but the sets were very minimalist which was not to our taste. We also went on the opera tour which was very",
          "I see reviews how wonderful this building is but really it has nothing on the old buildings that surround this lovely City. It is modern and from what I am told, it has great acoustics and as I did not see a performance here, I can\u2019t comment on that.",
          "This is in a beautiful sea side location and is a stunning contemporary building. We had hoped to go inside but it was completely closed and no notices saying when it was open which was a great shame, hence the 'average' score.",
          "The view from out side is fabulous and also the inside auditorium is spacious. It is an unique structure. The interiors were also fantastic, though we didn't have the opportunity to listen to any program.",
          "We came to this opera house a few years ago to see 2 performances, but this time it was to see Nixon in China. The production was excellent, the best of the 3 productions of this opera that I have seen, The opera house itself is a spectacular building set on the front of the",
          "We had a large business dinner here (rather than see an opera) it is a superb venue for this type of event with plenty of room. The views across the harbour are stunning and number of old interesting buildings can be seen including the Queens house. As a wheelchair user I had no",
          "See when you visit the harbour and on route to the town across the river. Don't make a special trip or prioritise it on a short city break, but worth a see if you have time.",
          "While on a canal cruise through Copenhagen the opera house was one of the highlights. Quite a architectural work it was quite impressive. Did not tour inside the facility.",
          "Set on the water, the Copenhagen Opera House is a focal point in Copenhagen. We saw it by land and by sea. There are beautiful multicolored chandeliers in the lobby visible from the outside. A",
          "If someone would like to enjoy the view of Copenhagen, this is one of place you must visit in Copenhagen. You can avail the footbridge from Nayhavn to Opera House, you will enjoy the experience of the pathways. But please check the weather before you leave, always try to visit",
          "This was our second visit, this time La Bohem. Last visit was rock concert so did not need the text display. For the opera I found the running translation essential but it is placed so high on the stage, It is impossible to read and follow opera at same time. The seats on parque",
          "If you appreciate Opera (as we do), you'll be eager to attend a performance here. The acoustics are wonderful and the seating is comfortable and well spaced. It's easy to get around this substantial building. We walked over from our hotel, many people took the Opera boat which",
          "The view of the Opera House from the other side of the water is beautiful ! Enjoyed the walk by the water.",
          "Great view from the river. Nice building with a very precisely made aula and interesting inner concept.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this informative & humorous tour. History & development of this fantastic building and how it functions today. Behind the scenes tour - literally! Understand why opera is so expensive now. Lars was an great advocate for opera & an excellent guide.",
          "Just past Nyhaven... walk a bit further along the pier and you will come across really stunning places. This is one of them. See if something is on otherwise you can hang about on the pier.",
          "This opera House is in a wonderful location - just next to the canal and you can go their by boat. Go for a guided Tour and/or book tickets for an opera (be careful very expensive). A lot of great designs inside",
          "This building dominates this part of the Nyhavn. If you squint your eyes, the roof becomes like a paper boat and it changes from different angles. This is the result of the argumants between the CEO of Maersk corporation and the architect employed to design it...a compromise so",
          "An amazingly good performance - great dancers - was blown away by their skills; performance took place at \"TAkkelloftet\" - a rather intimate location at the opera house",
          "This modern opera building is always impressive sitting on the waterfront. Not exactly my type of architecture but still very impressive.",
          "We saw this building from boat trip wow impressive building roof size of football pit juts out over water",
          "One of the reasons I returned to Copenhagen was to take my wife and son to visit the Opera House, funded by Maersk. I like the design very much and my family were suitably impressed.",
          "The opera house is nothing how you imagine it to look compared to the rest of Copenhagen, yet saying that, in its own right it is a hugely impressive modern building. Sitting right on the water front, it can be viewed via a water tour or a short walk away from the city centre.",
          "I had the pleasure of walking up to this spot from aways in the city. Quite a remarkable sight and great for photos - close-up or far away across the river from the palace. Worth the hike!",
          "Our Tour Guide said this Massive Looking Opera House is one of the most expensive opera houses ever built with construction costs well over US$500 million, sounds crazy, no? any way, i can say that i was not a kind of eye catching opera house such as Opera house in Vienna or",
          "The location of the opera house is nice as it faces the water. However, i was not impressed by the architecture, i found it to be a massive and cold block of concrete with sharp edges. Maybe i just cannot appreciate enough architecture. However, i liked the theatre.",
          "The Opera House sits perfectly alongside, what has to be the most interesting power plant i've ever seen. The perfect balance of classic & modern architecture in close proximity.",
          "The design itself is so appealing that even if you don't want to (like me), you will step inn. Its crazier inside than outside.....GOOOO",
          "Impressive building on the harbour side, which you pass on your small boat tour. Behind this is a building which actually has a ski slope on the roof. Left hand side as you look. In the summer people cliff dive off the Opera House roof directly into the harbour!,",
          "We purchased seats on-line for the performance of Die Fledermaus which was sung in Danish with Danish subtitles. We knew the story but were given an English libretto which we scanned to remind us of the action. It was a modern dress production with some weird staging; one scene",
          "We loved the airiness, lighting and space of this beautiful modern architecture. The location is spectacular as well. The seating felt bit cramped and with too many seats between aisles which makes entry and exit from your seat long and hindrance to other guests. The",
          "During my walking tour we passed by this very unattractive building. It looked totally out of place and I really couldn\u2019t understand why this structure was allowed to be built in the first place.",
          "An absolutely stunning beautiful right on the water, on the opposite to the city, stands really prominently on the waters edge, super chilly on a cold wintery November day, but so worth the walk over to it, or from the city side you also get a good view.",
          "The building is an architectural marvel, both inside and out, but best time to set it is at night. As you approach it from Nyhavn on the water bus, you see it glimmering in the distance. Upon disembarking and walking toward the bui the light show gets better and better. Once",
          "Very competent guided tour with many history and architectonic overviews, splendid out views, beautiful opera room, impressive material and the backstage rooms were so great and interesting how everything works. Take your 1.5 hour for this very nice trip!",
          "Copenhagen is a wonderful blend of old and new architecture and the 'new' opera house stood out from all the 'old' buildings on the canal cruise. We did not visit inside. Maybe next time?",
          "It\u2019s a must see from outside, very pretty. (You actually can\u2019t miss it when in Copenhagen, it\u2019s really big and just across the water) we went for a quick check inside, also pretty, but we didn\u2019t see alot. Nice view over the skyline when standing at the feet of the opera house.",
          "The rather new opera house is still exceptional then it comes to the architectural expression and the technical facilities for the opera. In the discussion about the opera house is beautiful or not I am not on the majority side. I am generally not that keen on large modern",
          "An amazing opera house in the water front having great view from the other side, an excellent modern architecture",
          "Even though it's a bit tricky to get to the Opera House it's a beautiful building and it's a really good experience to listen to the music and see the performance with a comfortable seating. However the restaurant is a real disappointment. Quick showing to table, but then",
          "Great architecture but looks a little out of place. Deigned but the architect who designed the Sydney Opera House",
          "A fine example of the modern thinking of the cities architects, there are a number of the floors that sit below the waterline",
          "We only admired it from across the water but it's stunning from that perspective. Copenhagen is great at mixing old and new and this is one of the most beautiful modern buildings.",
          "Amazing place with beautiful architecture,one of the best places to walk next to the channel and watch the sunset.",
          "Having been to the Opera House in Sydney we would like to have experienced the one in Copenhagen. We were there for only 2 days and due to the diving championships from the top of the building were not able to view the inside of the building.Next time for sure.",
          "We attended the premier of Il Trovadore. It was an absolutely fantastic experience. Tip: for a bite to eat ahead of time go by the restaurant \u201cBarr\u201d near the bridge. There is plenty of outdoor dining there with good variety. The acoustics of the opera are wonderful as others",
          "When you're on a canal tour, you pass by this huge structure. What's most impressive is the huge cantilever roof.",
          "We arrived late for the show.... pretty embarrassing! But the staff were super helpful and friendly... thank you! The concert hall is also extremely impressive. TACK!",
          "So much fun to see this beauty in Copenhagen. It's a marvel of modern construction that rivels Oslo's magnificent building, but with a style and character all its own. Nobody walks to the roof like in Oslo. But this is conservative Copenhagen and that's not expected. The",
          "It's Danish so the design is unusual, we saw this as part of a canal ride. The building has been built to act as a mirror, so when going past you see your reflection",
          "We didn't get inside but admired the stylish building from the other side of the water during our walk to Amalienborg.",
          "Not quite the Sydney Opera house but certainly distinctive and worth adding to the scrapbook documenting trip to Copenhagen. Easy to view from a canal tour boat.",
          "If you get a chance to attend a performance while in the city, definitely take the opportunity. The opera house is supposed to look like a ship. I don\u2019t really see it but still think it\u2019s an impressive building....",
          "Great contemporary architecture and with a guide if you can join a tour, all the more interesting. I haven't seen the inside but worth to be admired.",
          "This is a very modern and stylish building that can be seen from the canal boat cruise or from across the water.",
          "Went to the opera house to watch the Red Bull extreme diving, the place is beautiful I had hospitality in the Opera House I had access to every level the place is truly awesome and well worth a visit",
          "It's a cool building, and if you walk the length of Nyhavven, you'll see it anyway. Don't eat inside, looks like a tourist trap/place people go for pricy buisness meals. Tons of restaurants right nearby, so check those out instead.",
          "We saw it twice - once from the canal boat tour and once from across the water. Beautiful modern architecture, framed perfectly by the open courtyard of the old palace",
          "Located along the water. Lots of room for parking . Popular spot to rest and view the sights across the water. The glass spheres inside are eye catching and add to the beauty of the building",
          "A very modern, impressive building right on the water. The roof juts out over the water and has been used by divers apparently! It\u2019s definitely worth a view if you\u2019re in the area or even on a canal tour that passes by!",
          "Only had the opportunity to see it from the water, but it seems a very lovely Opera house. It's roof was going to be used for some international diving competition.",
          "Magnificent house where almost all seats have an unobstructed clear view of the stage. One of the best modern opera houses in Europe? Probably!",
          "Check this building out from all angles! It is nothing short of impressive. Its one of my favourite buildings in europe",
          "The Opera House is a very striking modern building commanding the view from Amalienborg Palace the residence of the Royal family.",
          "The famous danish shipper financed it like Carlsberg family grounded and financed The Carlsberg New Glyptotek. I prefer the later, even if opera lover. Acoustics of this opera house are beyond your imagination, almost too unrealistic good, the opera house in built maybe by",
          "Not being a fan of modern architecture but this is massively impressive. There were no operas on when we visited but the building is amazing",
          "We took a short bike ride over (which in itself is spectacular). Great location and wonderful architecture. Right on water. Really wanted to go inside but unfortunately was closed. So advice would be to pick a day when it is open. Even the outside is worth a visit and then",
          "A beautifully designed structure befitting it\u2019s surroundings and being on the water. It directly faces the Royal Palace which is also on the water. It is an imposing structure . The interior is equally designed to perfection. Although it is on the other side of the waterway,",
          "The Copenhagen opera house is a very modern opera with wonderful design .We visited that place yesterday and really enjoyed the visiting",
          "Wow...after listened to the history of how difficult it was to get this building built. I was impressed with how it turned out. The trick is you have to look from the inside out to see the reason behind all of the turmoil of how it was upsetting to some. The building is well",
          "Not a ton to see here, but if you are a lover of Danish design, this building alone is worth a stop. It is just glorious in its architecture and lovely to look at.",
          "Ok, I work in opera, so I'm biased, but this theatre is quite spectacular, even if you can't imagine touring a performance space. There is so much to look at, and the guide, Lars, was so much fun and informative, along with being so excited to tell us about the place. It's",
          "This new opera house is stunning. Modern architecture which is impressive. We took a tour of the building which is available in English and well worth the detour. It is a short ferry trip from the main island.",
          "If you are visiting Copenhagen it is pretty difficult not to see this building as it stands across from the Amalienborg palace on a former naval man made island. It is an imposing structure with a sweeping roof. It is equally impressive on the inside, and a tour through the",
          "Building funded by the owner of Maersk shipping line who determined the location and the design. Notably the architect who designed the building didn't like the final result as dictated by Maersk and did not show to the opening!",
          "When you enter this modern building you are confronted by a foyer of maple wood carved like a gigantic wraparound seashell. The wood is stained a dragon blood colour and you can\u2019 t wait to go into the auditorium to find the balconies the same colour which invites you to be",
          "A must see when visiting Copenhagen. Walk, cycle or take a cab. Dont miss out Christinia and Street food, not very far from the Opera House.",
          "The modern architecture of the water front located opera house is both interesting and impressive, we got a great view from the water as part of our canal tour. Even if modern architecture is not your thing this is certainly worth taking the time to seek out.",
          "Viewed from the water the opera house is definitely distinctive. Really does not mesh with the surrounding buildings which for the most part are classic and old.",
          "while you have a good view on the new Opera also from accross the harbor, you will only see the details when coming here. the expanding roof reminds me a lot on the Lucerne KKL, and also else the two buildings have lots of similarities. while in Lucerne it is the lake, here it",
          "Pretty and architectural well designed building visible from the harbour. Anyone walking to the mermaid from the harbour will pass the building on the other side of the harbour. Definitely worth a glance to appreciate it.",
          "If you've seen Sydney's and Oslo's Opera Houses, this one pales in comparison. It seems totally our of place architecturally.",
          "This is such a striking building, from the outside or throughout the lobbies, that the house itself is almost an afterthought -- especially compared to the Gamle Scene at Kongens Nytorv. Too bad it's out of the way.",
          "The Copenhagen Opera House is a unique building, apparently it has a football field on the roof, which was a rather interesting insight. You can't miss seeing this if you are on a boat cruise.",
          "Lovely place to visit. Conveniently located to other sites. It is not the Sydney Opera House but it is worth the visit.",
          "We went for a walk around the water front in Copenhagen & came across this building on the outside of the harbour on inquiring we were told it was the Opera House. Danish Architectures stands out all over the world like our Opera House in Sydney Australia also Danish designed.",
          "With much assistance from the front desk of the hotel, we were able to get same evening tickets to the opera. Seeing the house from the inside and enjoying a delightful comic opera was worth the ticket price that rivals the Kennedy Center in DC.",
          "Was advised to visit Copenhagen\u2019s Opera house & it is completely different to Sydney Australia\u2019s Opera House!",
          "We saw the Barber of Seville here and it was incredible. Great production. It was a beautiful venue in a great location of the city. The views out the windows add to a perfect experience",
          "We visited the Royal Palace for the change of the guards and stopped at the Opera house which is one of few famous modern buildings in Copenhagen. It seas close to 1500 spectators. Impressive stage, orchestra pit and acoustics.",
          "The group took a bus and canal tour of the Opera House. I took a few pics. The guide give us an overview of the Opera House and its Chandeliers",
          "Take the harbour bus from Nyhavn to Esplanaden. Admired the exterior before going in. Enjoyed the walk round the outside and experienced Danish architecture. Do look across the water and see Amalienborg castle and Marble church lying in a row. Indeed a beautiful waterside",
          "During our walking all over Copenhagen, my son and I crossed over the bridge and enjoyed the opera house. It is beautifully built and positioned on the water. There is so much to see and explore in Copenhagen by foot, including the opera house.",
          "We didn't tour the inside of the opera house; however, the exterior architecture is world class. Best viewed from a boat.",
          "After walking through the royal palace residences, it is striking to see this very modern building across the water. Very dramatic and modern lines. It would have been interesting to see how the acoustics are inside the opera house.",
          "Amazing building. Very fine example of good modern architecture. It can be seen from sightseeing tours by boat if you don't plan to go inside.",
          "The Opera House was closed for us on visit. But we were able to see the wonderful architecture from the water. Beautiful.",
          "We passed this impressive building during our boat tour. It is the biggest opera house in the world, even bigger than Sydney and has a beautiful elegant design. I would love to see inside and experience the accoustics",
          "Maersk shipping \"paid\" for it but many people in Denmark think the money could have been spent in a lot better way for a lot more people. Nice to look at but, a building is a building.",
          "It is a nice opera house. Very modern style architecture. I prefer the classical looking European opera houses than these modern style edifice. Still stands out from the typical fairy style architecture that adorns this lovely city.",
          "See it from the canal boat tour or go there for an opera, otherwise, I would say that it is not really worthwhile.",
          "Very interesting architectural achievement, built 60% on the ground and 40% in the sea. As a futuristic building this makes us feel optimistic. One of the new buildings that people of Copenhagen feel proud of. I watched a modern opera based on an old film (exterminating angel)",
          "Very nice modern opera house in Copenhagen,I visited that wonderful place yesterday together with my friends .",
          "I was lucky to get the see the opera house during the day and night. The light effects to the opera house make it very beautiful during the night.",
          "Wonderful evening in this fantastic building. Get to the opera across the water by the ferry bus that runs especially for the event.",
          "Such a fantastic building and you can sit inside or outside and admire it. We sat outside in the elastic rope deckchairs in the winter sunshine with snow by the sides of the building. Magic!",
          "Great production, great set and great cast. Never did master the Dutch art of queuing for a water taxi and managing to get on without offending someone pushing to get in front.",
          "It is certainly worth to visit the opera in Copenhagen. We booked tickets for a guided tour at 11 o'clock. We had to wait for the guide for at least 20 minutes but that was no problem since there was a free music theater performance for children on Sunday morning. The building",
          "We prepaid 4 tickets for a guided tour at 12 on a Sunday. We came to the Opera directly at 12, but all the doors were closed and there was nobody to help out. We soon realized we were not the only ones - there was at least 10 other people that prepurchased the tickets and",
          "Viewing the Opera House from the water or the Amalianbourg palace is the best thing. It is a huge imposing building with a slightly industrial air, inherited no doubt from its benefactor Maersk. Worth seeing alongside other architecture of interest in Copenhagen.",
          "The Copenhagen Opera House is a beautiful venue. We enjoyed a production of Alcina with wonderful singers and musicians. Very reasonable ticket prices. The opera was sung in Italian; the translation in Danish, so I just got to enjoy the music without worrying about the words. :)",
          "The Copenhagen Opera House is a real landmark. Beautiful architecture. Located at the waterfront like many opera buildings.",
          "Unfortunately for us there was a private party in the Opera House on the day we visited so we didn't get to check out the acoustics of the building which was a pity. We did get a really quick visit in however and has given us a reason to return to Copenhagen to check this out",
          "Good design, friendly staff. bar and snacks priced reasonable. Dreadful coofee. Easy access by ferry from Nyhavn.",
          "As in many other cities (Hamburg, Oslo, Stockholm), they have chosen to build an opera house near the city's water, which makes the building feel even more impressive and stately. Here are the clean lines and a strict architecture that is the expression and even if you know that",
          "This is normally reached by boat, which adds to the romantic atmosphere. Before and after an opera, there are extra boats. Going home at night, in the boat, with the lights of Cph ahead, it is magical. Everyone singing arias made it very special. Operas were good too!",
          "Probably the worst thing ever build in Copenhagen; I would spend my time on this by sending a short sight seen from the distance",
          "We went here too see a comedy show, the building is beautifull, and the sound is great in the hall. A little row at the bars tho, but it was fine.",
          "Our first trip ever to a opera and what a experience. We loved every part of it. The show, Barber of seville, was Fantastic. Excellent acting and signing by lead, Mr.\u00d8lberg",
          "A must visit if you are in Copenhagen City. We have been there twice and still wanna come back. It is a real nice area to visit",
          "We went here on the free night I.e. The culture night in Copenhagen when with a pass one can visit several great places. This is just grand! Grand and beautiful and in a strange way also serene. The story goes that this was built by the Maersk owner and he gifted it to Danish",
          "Located within a short walk from the Admiral Hotel and Copenhagen it is a must visit while in Denmark.",
          "Can\u2019t pick my favorite part of the Opera House. It\u2019s gorgeous, the sound is amazing, the view is spectacular!",
          "I saw the Opera House while walking from Nyhavn to The Little Mermaid, this was extremely beautiful!",
          "Visited the Copenhagen Opera House for the New Year's Eve Concert by the Royal Danish Orchestra. The performance itself was spectacular - gave me the goosebumps... As for the venue, everything was pretty much brand new. I reserved a seat on the first level balcony and I find",
          "Take a boat trip and view this flamboyant piece of modern architecture from different angles. All cities need something like this",
          "We booked a tour of the Opera house on New Year\u2019s day and found it very interesting and informative. Great building and behind the scenes are very impressive. Will have to visit again to watch an opera! Well worth taking the tour.",
          "Walked to the Opera House during the day and it was closed! Read that inside there is a collection of sculptures and fine architectural features, but no room at the inn.",
          "Just visited from the outside. Did I like it, not really but I'm glad somebody has designed something different. Go and make up your own mind.",
          "You could be misled by simple external appearance. Inside is stunning and very well planned. Auditorium is in full contrast to outside.",
          "Drove by this building in the ferry a few times. Looks spectacular. Would love to have gone inside. Will be back to see it again",
          "Beautiful part of town over looking the bay. If you seeing Nyhavn then this is just a 2min stroll to get here.",
          "The building of opera was very interesting architecture on the coast itself. We did not have time to visit but definitely have to go",
          "The tour was given by one of the orchestra members (French horn player). Knowledgeable. Engaging. Personable. We have a son who works professionally backstage in theater. He spoke highly of the guide's technical knowledge. Fascinating to hear the history and learn some of the",
          "We went to the Opera House to... indeed, enjoy an opera. The opera was great but the house itself is breathtaking. Beautiful architecture, unique in all its details. Even worth it for just a visit. The ultimate eye catcher are the lamps in the main hall. Amazing. There is also a",

          "Take a small detour and visit this building. The architecture is stunning. The view from every floor of the building is beautiful. This is another perfect Henning Larsen design. It is right across from the royal residence, which also makes for a beautiful contrast.",
          "Our tour group stopped here and were able to go inside for a quick look around. The smooth wooden sculpture wall contrasts with the sleek steel and glass structure. It cost far more than a half billion US dollars to construct this neo-futuristic wonder. It was completed in",
          "The sightseeing bus stopped here, it's a really ice modern opera. From the other side you see amalienburg. Really nice on a sunny day.",

          "This is a spectacular building, especially inside, which looks quite different from outside. The wooden curved interior and sparkly jewel balls are almost at odds with the square modern exterior. But come for the divine music and the acoustics. Seats are available at many",
          "I didn't end up visiting the opera (Copenhagen is expensive!), but the modern design of the building is impressive and right on the water's edge, so it can be seen from many places.",
          "We , being opera buffs , visited many of the most renowned operas of the world and consequently were eager to see the newest entry . Unfortunately , being summertime , there has been no performance to be seen , but we took the tour . We heard the fascinating story of the 'fight'",
          "The place was closed so we only got the view on the outside which was impressive. Close by we viewed the Royal yacht which was very grand.",

          "Walked to the Opera House to view it to be told it can only be toured by prior online arrangement - very disappointing!",
          "We pre-booked the 1h15min guided tour in EN during a visit to Copenhagen on a Sunday morning as it were. Our guide, Anders, was very knowledgeable about the construction phase but also on the planning and design where the sponsor tried to influence the architect to suit his",
          "We were allowed to use the bathroom here (I wanted to gain access just to see the place) what a wonderful building. Such a shame we couldn't get to take a tour. Will have to go back another time",
          "We went on a tour of this excellent building and were given many interesting facts about its construction. Never seen a building like it and both the facade and interior decor are outstanding. Don't just see it from a canal boat, go inside!",
          "We visited to see Macbeth (Opera by Verdi). Italian with Danish translation... but one could find the English text online, which was a bonus. Lovely acoustics and a great place to visit in the evening",

          "A local told us to go here to get the best views and photos of the city. We went right before they closed and took the elevator to the top floor. It was a cool experience.",
          "On a recent visit to Copenhagen, the 3 of us, my partner, 21-year-old daughter and I decided to visit the Copenhagen Opera House. Well worth the visit. Thoroughly enjoyed by all 3.",
          "Just another instantly forgettable modern monstrosity, don't really care if the acoustics are great (for the record so's La Scala Milan!)",
          "A beautiful strikingly contemporary building which sits on the water's edge. Well worth a look even from a distance.",
          "Accessible by boat, bike, foot or car, this is a fantastic place to see a performance. We watched La Boheme and everything from the acoustics to the seats was perfect.",
          "I only saw the building from the outside but will return to visit the opera some day. The building is modern and VAST! The roof itself is the size of 2 soccer fields! A modern piece of architecture which competesa with the Oslo opera house.",
          "This building not only has very good acoustics and excellent seating and viewing. The building is made to make the most out off the building design using nature to both heat and cool truely amazing",
          "The building is extraordinary, but for a full experience book a performance. The programme is on their website. The tickets are sent as pdf attachments and can be printed at home. Arrive at least 2 hours early to explore the building and have a drink and snack at one of the",

          "The Copenhagen Opera House is a newer, world-class piece of architecture. It sits prominently on the waterway directly across from Amalienborg Palace - you get a gorgeous view of it from the Palace gardens. The Marble Church, the Amalienborg Palace are all in a straight line -",

          "You won't miss it if you are on the canal boat tour. It's strikingly different from all the buildings in the area. It modern structure made this an iconic site in Copenhagen right on the waterfront.",
          "allthough the opera is a huge complex the architecture gives you a feeling of lighness and transparency. the location is breathtaking and exactly opposite (across the river) of the royal palace. another cultural/architectural highlight across the river is the theatre.",
          "It has a special view from the cruz in the sea but it was not really interesting for me.may be for some one who is interested in modern architecture.",
          "Built so that the Queen could see it from her home, the opera house is an unusually modern building set against the old city of Copenhagen. Your best picture opportunity will be on a bike or boat tour of the city.",
          "A good shot of this iconic building is nice and best done from the excellent canal cruises as you sail past.",
          "You can walk all ver and views inside and out are great. Opera house is hard to get to. Long walk from downtown or take water taxi. I wish I had seen a performance but hardly anything playing in summer.",
          "This is a must when you go to CPH. Note that it can be reached by a boat (\"public river bus\") from Nyhavn and by land. The easiest way is by far the \"the river bus\".",
          "If you have limited time to see everything take a river cruise and the guide on the boat will point out various landmarks including this modern piece of architecture amongst others.well worth seeing on the riverside!",

          "Toured the facility together with my family (including sons 12 and 15). Had a great time during the one hour tour. The tour was in English and our guide was enthusiastic and had a good sense of humor. Was amazed by the back stage area. It's unbelievable how large it is and",

          "I only saw the Opera House from the other side of the water, so I wasn't able to go in. It is a great piece of architecture, with the huge roof that extends over the front.",

          "I went to two operas. It is a short walk from the end of Nyhavn and there is a water bus after the performance to take you back for 24 DKK. The building is spacious, with glass facade under a canopy, well designed and very handsome. Worth a visit even if you do not attend a",
          "We biked over to the Opera house to try and buy tickets to a performance and got invited to join the free year end performance of the students at the Academy of Opera. Had a good time watching the students in a side theater. All the staff at the opera house were very nice to",

          "Very good architecture design just like read from the travel guide, easy to see from distance. Good to visit.",

          "good venue for a concert, small with comfortable seats and what a view across the water. Can walk from the town or get a ferry across although the locals seem to get on their bikes when attending a show",
          "Really nice and elegant building in a great position. I love it. Nice to see by boat too. There are several restaurants inside",
          "I did not go inside this time. I passed by, which I do everytime I am in Cph. One day, it could be the equavalent 'SYDNEY OPERA' in Europe.",
          "I love how Copenhagen builds a super modern opera house right across from beautiful historic buildings, and somehow they manage to make the modern architecture complement the mood of the rest of the neighborhood. If you can't get a ticket to a performance or aren't interested,",

          "Saw La Boheme here, the building was wonderful- very beautiful. Accoustics excelent. Note that if you get tickets the seating numbering is weird, with even seats together- they are not in ordinary numerical order as far as we could see. The opera itself was good, but it took a",
          "This opera house is a beautiful building that looks just as amazing on the inside. It is definitely worth a visit while you are in Copenhagen. If you plan your day, it is right next to the royal palace so if you only wish to see the outside of it you can do it at the same time.",
          "Wonderful piece of architecture that looks great both from the outside and inside. Right on the river and great views from the boat trip",

          "My daughter and I went to go see the ballet production of Swan Lake. At first, we were concerned about how we would get to and from the opera house, which is across the water from where we were staying. Not to worry. There were water shuttle services before the opera and after",
          "This is by far the most modern I have seen. Full of sharp angles and platforms to walk on. It's right on the water, so taking pictures from the top is a must. Bring your water just in case you get a little thirsty going up.",

          "Quite a gift from Mr M\u00f8ller to the danish people! Not the prettiest of buildings in Copenhagen ... rather looks like an airport terminal, but inside its quite impressive and inside its a lot nicer. The concert hall is very good.",

          "We did the afternoon guided tour of the opera house and enjoyed the great water views from inside. This unplanned guided tour is one of the highlights of our trip.",

          "Beautiful opera house, would probably just visit from the outside if I were to have my time again! There are better things to do in Copenhagen, I would probably visit again if I had opera tickets booked.",
          "The opera house is interesting. Not the best or worst I have seen. The grounds around it are interesting. I liked the view from across the water.",
          "Saw a wonderful production of Traviata there which was as modern as the building with very good singers. The view over the water is breathtaking, especially at night.",

          "The Opera House is open for touring daily. For a guided tour you would pay 100 DKK. The building is situated on the waterfront and the architecture I'd stunning. Of the 14 floors, 5 are subterranean.",
          "We had a lovely night watching an Italian Opera here , unfortunately I had too much to eat and drink at a superb Fish Restaurant before the show so fell asleep half way through ! If it is not too crowded you may buy a ticket for a cheap seat then have the chance to be upgraded",
          "Didn't go to a performance but from the boat tour got a great view and that was fine for me. Might be a bit tricky to get to, so research ahead of time if you are set on going to it.",

          "I like seeing Opera here. It is amazing and I love the architecture. Simply a great night out when you get the right Opera. Carmen is a winner. Could be on this year. Take the boat over from Nyhavn and have a beer on the way back.",
          "I have just visited the Opera house for a guided tour. Lars, the guide was extremely knowledgeable, professional, and the love for the place was just radiating from him. The tour was 1,5 hours, touching on the design and architecture, backstage and of course the auditorium. At",

          "I have gone there twice. Once to see Mozarts The Magic Flute which was so so and once to see Zulu Comedy Galla which was quite fun. The building is very beautiful, both inside and out. The serve really nice drinks, beers and champagne. Definitely worth a visit.",

          "We enjoyed getting there by boat and were lucky that it was not raining when we got out. Would have been a problem waiting for the boat to go back to Nyhaven at 10 PM. We liked the inside of the building and its acoustical quality more than the view from the outside.",
          "Lovely modern building but unfortunately no time to see the inside. Nice to see buildings that look like a sculpture",

        "wiki": "Nyhavn (Danish pronunciation: [\u02c8ny\u02cch\u0251w\u02c0n]; New Harbour) is a 17th-century waterfront, canal and entertainment district in Copenhagen, Denmark. Stretching from Kongens Nytorv to the harbour front just south of the Royal Playhouse, it is lined by brightly coloured 17th and early 18th century townhouses and bars, cafes and restaurants. The canal harbours many historical wooden ships.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNyhavn was constructed by King Christian V from 1670 to 1675, dug by Swedish prisoners of war from the Dano-Swedish War 1658\u20131660. It is a gateway from the sea to the old inner city at Kongens Nytorv (King's Square), where ships handled cargo and fishermens' catch. It was notorious for beer, sailors, and prostitution. Danish author Hans Christian Andersen lived at Nyhavn for some 18 years.\nThe first bridge across Nyhavn opened on 1874. It was a temporary wooden footbridge. It was replaced by the current bridge in 1912.As ocean-going ships grew larger, Nyhavn was taken over by internal Danish small vessel freight traffic. After World War II land transport took over this role and small vessel traffic disappeared from the Port of Copenhagen, leaving Nyhavn largely deserted of ships.\nIn the mid-1960s, the Nyhavn Society (Danish: Nyhavnsforeningen) was founded with the aim of revitalising the area. In 1977, Nyhavn was inaugurated as a veteran ship and museum harbour by Copenhagen's Lord Mayor Egon Weidekamp. In 1980 Nyhavn quay was pedestrianised; it had been used as a parking area in the previous years which had coincided with a dwindling of harbour activities. Since then it has become a popular spot for tourists and locals alike, serving the function of a square according to architects Jan Gehl and Lars Gemz\u00f8e.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe northern side of Nyhavn is lined by brightly coloured townhouses built with wood, bricks, and plaster. The oldest house, at No. 9, dates from 1681.\nBetween 1845 and 1864, Hans Christian Andersen lived at No. 67, where a memorial plaque now stands. From 1871-1875 Andersen lived at Nyhavn 18, which currently houses an Andersen-themed souvenir shop.\nThe southern side of Nyhavn has lavish mansions lining the canal, including Charlottenborg Palace at the corner of Kongens Nytorv.\n\n\n== Veteran Ship and Museum Harbour ==\n\nNyhavn Veteran Ship and Museum Harbour, occupying the inner section of Nyhavn, between the Nyhavn Bridge and Kongens Nytorv, is lined with old ships. From the foundation of the heritage harbour in 1977, the south side of the canal has been reserved for museum ships owned by the Danish National Museum, which received a donation of carefully restored ships from A. P. M\u00f8ller, while the northern side of the canal was put at the disposal of the Nyhavn Society and privately owned, still usable wooden ships.\nHarbor ships include:\n\nLightvessel XVII Gedser Rev \u2013 lightvessel built in Odense in 1895, in operation until 1972, then acquired by the National Museum and now serving as a museum ship.\nSvalan af Nyhavn \u2013 galleass built in Jungfrusund in 1924\nAnna M\u00f8ller \u2013 galleass built in Randers in 1906\nMA-RI \u2013 purpose-built smuggling ship built in 1920; boarded by custom authorities off Elsinore with smuggling goods aboard in 1923, then confiscated and sold on auction, then operated both as a fishing vessel and as a ferry between Poland and Bornholm, again as a smuggling vessel.\nMira \u2013 two-masted schooner built in F\u00e5borg in 1898, considered one of the finest ships of the Danish small vessel traffic of the time. For many years it transported chalk from Stevns. The first ship on the north side of Nyhavn, coming from Kongens Nytorv.\nThe Boat Theatre - a lighter-type barge built in Copenhagen in 1898, since 1972 operated as a theatre boat.\n\n\n== The Memorial Anchor ==\n\nThe great Memorial Anchor (Danish: Mindeankeret) at the end of Nyhavn, where it meets Kongens Nytorv, is a monument commemorating the more than 1,700 Danish officers and sailors in service for the Navy, merchant fleet or Allied Forces, who sacrificed their lives during World War II. The Anchor was inaugurated in 1951, replacing a temporary wooden cross erected on the spot in 1945, and has a plaque with a monogram of King Frederik VII on it. The Memorial Anchor is from 1872 and was used on the Frigate Fyn (Funen), which was docked at Holmen Naval Base during the Second World War. Every year on May 5 \u2013 Denmark's Liberation day 1945 \u2013 an official ceremony is held to honour and commemorate the fallen at the Memorial Anchor.\n\n\n== Bars and restaurants ==\n\nAlong its northern, sunnier side, Nyhavn is lined with many bars and restaurants facing the harbor.  Nyhavn serves as a hub of canal tours, but it can be chilly.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nKongens Nytorv metro station is located at the end of Nyhavn, though situated at the far end of the namesake square outside Magasin du Nord. The station is served by all four lines of the Copenhagen Metro.\nThe Copenhagen Harbour Buses has a stop at the mouth of Nyhavn. All four routes of the harbour buses, Routes 901, 902, 903 and 904, stop at the bus stop next to the Royal Playhouse.\nIn 2016 the Inner Harbor Bridge (Inderhavnsbro) connecting Nyhavn and Christianshavn was opened after years of setbacks and delays. The 180 m cycling and pedestrian drawbridge has been nicknamed the Kissing Bridge because its contour resembles two tongues meeting.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nNyhavn has been seen in numerous Danish films. It is for instance used as a location in a number of Olsen-banden films, for instance at 0:25:44 in The Olsen Gang on the Track and at 0:28:56 in the 1977 Olsen Gang film The Olsen Gang Outta Sight. The Memorial Anchor is seen at 1:16:57 in The Olsen Gang Sees Red..Nyhavn has also been featured in a number of international films.\n\nThe closing scenes of Ingmar Bergman's A Lesson in Love takes place in Nyhavn.\nIn the 1957 British-American action film Hidden Fear, Nyhavn is used as a central location.\nIn the 1963 German film The Lightship, Nyhavn is used as a location in spite of the fact that the film is set in Germany.\nIn the 1966 Alfred Hitchcock spy film Torn Curtain, Curtain (Paul Newman), who is on the way to DDR, is told to contact a used book seller at Kanalgade 1 which later turns out to be Nyhavn when his fianc\u00e9e (Julie Andrews) visits the address.\nIn the 2015 drama film The Danish Girl, Nyhavn is the location where Einar (Eddie Redmayne) and Gerda (Alicia Vikander) live, and it is also where Lili makes her first forays in public. Nyhavn is in the film presented as a fish market while Copenhagen's historic fish market was in fact located at Gammel Strand.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nElisabeth Levy's 1997 novel Et dukkehus i Nyhavn (A Doll House in Nyhavn) describes a young girls life in Nyhavn in 1929.\nAnne Marie Ejrn\u00e6s's 2002 biographical novel Som Svalen (Like the Swallow) about Thomasine Gyllenbourg begins when she is eight years old and lives in her father's home at Nyhavn 67.\nKarin Micha\u00eblis's 1936 children's book Lotte Ligeglad is about a girl who lives in Nyhavn where her mother owns a shop next to a tavern.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNu g\u00e5r v\u00e5ren gennem Nyhavn is a song by Sigfred Pedersen with melody by Niels Clemmensen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in Denmark\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCopenhagen-Portal - Nyhavn\nSource",

          "We visited in winter so no one was really sat outside, but the colourful houses and relaxed vibe were very pleasant.",
          "Great place to visit during the day or (especially) in the evening. Plenty of places to choose from.",
          "So lovely to see this, it was a lovely sunny day so lots of photo opportunities. Plenty of cafes to sit and watch the world go by and within walking distance of Copenhagen centre",
          "We\u2019re only here for a weekend but walking down the Nyhavn is a great experience. I think it\u2019s best to do at night as the lighting is excellent but definitely don\u2019t pass up on the authentic Danish harbour side in the day either!",
          "The historical context is lovely and I really liked it. But there are 2 points I don\u2019t like: - often there is a lot of garbage in the water, people throwing it in makes me sad - overpriced gastronomy Go there, take your pictures and enjoy a walk. But please have food somewhere",
          "Attractive and historically significant, but quite the tourist trap. See it and move on. Copenhagen has such beautiful neighborhoods and lovely restaurants. Take your selfie then head out to one of them.",
          "It is such an enjoyable spot to take in the local culture, sights, sounds, it\u2019s teeming with locals and guests from all over. It\u2019s a blend of the colorful, the slightly more toned down vibrancy you would find in South America but neatly and more classically done. I loved",
          "Charming views along the whole stretch. It is worth visiting when in Copenhagen. The colourful buildings, architecture and views make this place a must see.",
          "Canal pickup for water cruise, which takes in Opera House, Amalienbog, Little mermaid statue, its inexpensive cruise. The area is beautiful, lots of color on the buildings, restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream shops.",
          "When in Denmark, everyone walks around the Nyhavn. As well as being beautiful, there are some great ice cream places that you need to try! We love it there.",
          "Just lovely. Gorgeous buildings, cosy (but pricey) cafes, restaurants and coffee shops. Easy access to other parts of the city via the bike bridge.",
          "We visited this part of Copenhagen primarily for a photo of the canal surrounded by multiple colourful buildings, we then went to get some grub in one of the restaurants alongside the canal, due to the limited options on the menu and the pretty high prices we decided to eat",
          "Beautiful area which oozes history and character. So friendly and laid back, lots of choices of places to eat.",
          "Lots of photo opportunities and chance to take a canal cruise. Visited Nyhavn 37 for lunch - very good.",
          "A must see location when visiting CPH, iconic and beautiful. Lots of lovely caf\u00e9s along the harbor as well, worth visiting to spend more time there.",
          "It's visiting card of kopenhagen, must see place. I was walking by foot from Central Station, it's not far away. Usually full of tourists. Picturesque buildings, restaurants and ships that's how it looks like.",
          "Pretty canal side area with cobbled streets and a wide variety of bars and restaurants. Especially attractive at night when the boats are lit up.",
          "As a fan of the \"Danish Girl\", coming here was at the top of my \"tourist\" list. I walked to Nyhavn at least 3 times during my 4-day stay in Copenhagen. It really is so picturesque and quaint (despite it being a tourist trap). The entire scene of buildings, restaurants, water",
          "Very touristic site in centre - lots of restaurants and cool for awesome photography opportunities. Not too busy during winter season! Would avoid eating in this area as it\u2019s VERY expensive and you can find better options outside of this area.",
          "Nice walk down here.Colourful buildings.good for photos.good choice of dining places bars cafes etc.",
          "Very nice touristical place. We stayed in Copenhagen 2 days and we visited Nyhavn 4 times. Good restaurants near it and warm atmosphere. We will recommend this place definitely.",
          "If you like to walk - go there. If you tired and you just want to seat and enjoy the crowd around walking too - go there. You can spend view hours and you will feel like its only view minutes passed :)",
          "A good place to board a boat trip for sight seeing Copenhagen from the water . There are plenty of restaurants in this okd part of the city",
          "Much smaller version of similar in Amsterdam but colorful, \"fresh\" very pictures-worthy,I returned there 5 times in 4 days",
          "Beautiful place to take a photo, have a coffee or snack in some bar. I like it a lot, especially in summer days.",
          "Nice walk along the river, lots of restaurants, would be great when the weather is a little better to spend more time",
          "Honestly the only part of Copenhagen that looks like this. You get the impression before you leave that the whole city has this look. It is charming however this area is overpriced. Bars and restaurants wanting tourists who can\u2019t be bothered to look elsewhere to drink and eat in",
          "Really beautiful and worth a visit. We went at night and during the day for some lovely family photos.",
          "A little touristy, but a great sight. Even better in December its lined with a Christmas market. Lots of fun strolling along and checking the different stalls. I recommend the mulled wine you can get at some of the stalls. Great to have a warm beverage on a cold evening.",
          "A famous canal scape with the very attractive colourful buildings - a must see. We visited Copenhagen for 6 nights and stayed in Nyhavn so were visiting throughout the day. A busy area and quite touristy but also enjoyed by the locals. Plenty of dining and shopping options, or",
          "As many have said before, it's \"the\" place to visit in Copenhagen. Really pretty at night and day, never overly busy compared to other cities. I'd suggest taking a walking tour including here and stopping for a traditional beer or schnapps. You can also easily walk to the",
          "If you visit Copenhagen you must come here. It is beautiful and will make amazing photos, even if you are not a good photographer. It is pretty touristy but at least in January on a Sunday it was not bad.",
          "Nice little walk along this place with beautiful and colourful buildings. We took the canal tours and it was great. We get to see the whole of copenhagen. I love this city!",
          "If you go to Copenhagen of course you have to go to Nyhavn. It's the most famous spot and for a reason, the imagery is very beautiful especially at night with all the lights.",
          "Good place for a lovely walk alongside the colorful houses, lots of restaurants everywhere, good atmosphere",
          "Lots of colourful buildings with plenty of places to eat and drink. It is a bit pricier than other areas as it's very touristy, but it's nice for a drink and to look out on the canal. We took a boat tour for an hour which was really enjoyable too.",
          "Famous street in Copenhagen with canal and boats \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f in colder January. Not so crowded as during warmer day but interesting with Christmas \ud83c\udf84 decoration on boats \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Enjoy the drinks and food in big choice of restaurants",
          "The colorful buildings, fishing boats, charming sidewalk restuarants, what is not to love? You must stroll Nyhavn if you are coming to Copenhagen!",
          "This is the quintessential view of Copenhagen. Very picturesque. Lots of restaurants along the waterfront.",
          "Atmospheric former docks, good places for photos, restaurants and cafes...canal boats and near to Amalienborg",
          "A must see spot of Copenhagen. Great location to relax, have food and enjoy the best of viewings of Copenhagen. Tip, walk as much as you can around as you will find many food places!",
          "Nyhavn was my favorite place to visit in Copenhagen, especially because of the Christmas markets. We took a boat tour here that last for about an hour and then spent time shopping in the markets. Drinking hot wine and hot chocolate, while soaking in the beautiful views, gave my",
          "Um, a bit ambivalent about Nyhavn - yes it's a picture postcard location more in a \"yes, it looks like the pictures so, tick, seen that\" kind of way. Beautiful but very busy, even in December - we were trying to imagine what it would be like in summer packed with tourists like",
          "Great part of Copenhagen because of the architecture and ambiance. Probably a tourist trap in the Summer.",
          "Obviously a tourist spot and still busy in early January but very pretty with the Xmas lights still on. We stayed in the lovely Nyhavn 71 hotel and had a view of the canal. Their restaurant Sea, was excellent. We also found a bar called McJoy which was cosy. Interesting to find",
          "Lovely. Place to wander around. Unfortunately we were there at Christmas so most things were closed but such a nice atmosphere",
          "Lively winter with shoppers. We took a stroll along the riverbanks and made a few stops for hot coffees and waffles. Great shops lining the river",
          "Great for walking and having a nice meal or drink. Quiet and quaint area away from the busy city center and easy to get to as it is near where Strograd ends.",
          "Nyhavn is a great place to visit, with its colorful houses and canal (if you love photography, this is a must). Also, try a hot dog! Ask for one with all the toppings and I promise you will not be disappointed!",
          "We went here at Christmas, so the Christmas market was set up, it was lovely, walking along, looking at the stalls, and of course, you have to get some beautiful photos, with the coloured houses, I got some amazing photos, on the bridge, full of love locks, which adds to the",
          "Whilst this can be seen as an epicenter for restaurants in Copenhagen, I would say 'off the beaten track' has better to offer price wise and possibly food wise too. The location itself is lovely and most definitely worth a visit, including...the toilets, without doubt the nicest",
          "Upon recommendations we visited Nyhavn, it was beautiful. The lovely coloured buildings, the canal boats and a great atmosphere in general. We took one of the canal boat tours which was great, albeit a freezing day but we wrapped up well. We had lunch in a lovely little Italian",
          "Very beautiful place to walk and visit.They had some Christmas markets with amazing food and amazing products",
          "An easy walk to take in the beautiful area of Copenhagen. It was a dreary winter day, but the area was still beautiful! Very quite and not much open or people around.",
          "The whole of Copenhagen is sold on the promise of Nyhavn. A couple of brightly colored buildings with overpriced food options. Okay for some pictures but that is all there is to it. Church Absalon provides more cultural and on hands Danish experience. Not a negative",
          "Lovely bars to sit on the waterfront with the twinkling lights. Restaurants with quality food and super nice people.",
          "So beautiful. We walked through the Christmas village. Decorated beautifully. Wish we had time to eat at one of the outside cafes.",
          "Walking around and eat at one of the cafes around the harbour. Nice atmosphere here and try one of the boats around Copenhagen",
          "We stayed in a hotel close to the Nyhavn district and absolutely loved it! The colors, ambiance, sights and sound...as well as a variety of tastes make it well worth it. You can rent a canal boat ride or just sit at a street-side cafe and people watch. Highly, highly recommend!",
          "Perfection to look at. Don't buy coffee or anything, it's too expensive. But it looks like a postcard. Better visit it during the day and summer months.",
          "It is very photogenic place, I enjoy the view on the houses. Of course there are many visitors, but who weren\u00b4t there weren\u00b4t in Copenhagen.",
          "Visit one or two of the many restaurants. Mix with the Danes and take the walk along the canal with the old classical ships. Have a beer sitting on the sides, close to the water and enjoy the streets musicians. The \u201cNyhavn\u201d is close to the Royal Theater and the pedestrian street",
          "This is a lovely area for a stroll. Colourful buildings each housing a different bar or restaurant. We visited after Christmas so all outdoor tables had rugs on the seats and some outdoor heating. Highly recommend for a stroll",
          "It is a place you never miss at Copenhagen. Just find a place to take a picture for making your own post card.",
          ".Wow, what a lobely lively busy district of Copenhagen. It was full of Christmas markets which was just lovely,",
          "Nyhavn very nice and Colourfull. recommended to visit and also book a boat trip. lots of restaurants to choose from",
          "Went there during cold and rainy, and took boat ride cruise through the canal. The place is iconic with colorful building, very nice spot for picture",
          "Tourists are eager of beauty. And Nyhavn is worth a visit if you are only a few days in Copenhaguen. You will see other coloured and ancient houses around the city, but not so well aligned, and not so well posted as if they were posing for a picture. And this is what we tourists",
          "Title says it all really , very pretty but a bit dull . Loads of bars etc vying for your custom . Nice canal side walk , but nothing you cannot do elsewhere in Copenhagen.",
          "It\u2019s a lovely area to walk around for some history . But I found the area too commercialised. Christmas markets in the area were lovely.",
          "This is the photo in every travel magazine and Nyhavn lives up to the photo in real life. I recommend travellers take a canal boat trip to see the capital. It is a brilliant angle to view Nyhavn. Then take a stroll around the harbour and have a coffee or beer to soak up the",
          "Upon arrival at the location we were amazed by the two young musicians who are serving as a background music to the whole area. There are stalls selling different snacks and souvenirs. Visited this place twice and we never find this statue without visitors. Either we chose the",
          "Clearly one of the most visited spots in Copenhagen - it is very pretty place with a nice atmosphere. Beautiful pictures of colourful buildings with boats on the canal. Expect crowds it is a popular place. Take the photo for instagram - its this type of place.",
          "Beautiful area by the canals. Lots of holiday lights and music, lots of tourists. Boats, hotels, cafes.",
          "We went there during x'mas, so there's a nice little x'mas stall line up to shop, eat, and take photos - other than that, the x'mas market across the street is much more festive. I dined at one of the promoted restaurants (from Copenhagen tourism board) 37 Nyhavn, food is not",
          "Beautifully decorated with lights candles hearts Santa glitteringly friendly atmosphere a lovely place to hang out with family or friends",
          "We visited around 5pm on December 13th and were lucky enough (planned) to see the Kayak parade into the harbour. It was really beautiful and atmospheric.",
          "This is a place to enjoy the ambience, do some people watching and relax. The restaurants are more expensive than some areas, but the food was good. The harbor tours originate here and are a good way to see this area One tip I can pass on. If you want to enjoy a beer it is a lot",
          "A \"colourful\" pier surrounded by compact houses / buildings that is ideal for a relaxing stroll or a bicycle ride, accompanied by a visit to one of the many restaurants and bars there at any time of the day. Very central location and there is a metro station nearby.",
          "Whilst visiting mid December we were lucky enough to see the extension of the Christmas market running along the edge of the street which added at lot of quaint stalls and nice Christmasy food. The location is an easy place to get on one of the boat tours operating in the area",
          "Walk along the canal and enjoyed the views and Christmas Market! Easy access from metro and new harbor bridge. A top attraction to reflect and slow down.",
          "It\u2019s a walking distance from the rail station. The little market is worth visiting and it\u2019s a nice place to take a rest with a cup of coffee!",
          "It's a nice Pier with bars and restaurants and a lot of Christmas shacks. There are also some boats that offer cruises.",
          "Lovely place, beautiful scenery. Shame our visit was ruined by the rain. It was made better with Christmas markets running its length and plenty of food and drink places.",
          "We visited Nyhavn - lovely colourful houses near the canal. We are lunch at one of the restaurants and walked through the Christmas market. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "November does not seem a best month for sightseeing however as long it doesn't rain it is still OK to visit Copenhagen and have a boat excursion through its channel. In nearly an hour one can get a view of admirable colorful old buildings, and must know examples of Copenhagen",
          "This area at Christmas is amazing, the Danish really know how to decorate. The architecture is really beautiful and interesting and close by are many shops and restraurants. The one thing that was disappointing was the canal boat trip. If you sit on the right you see everything,",
          "It was every bit as lovely as I\u2019d hoped, lots of cosy places to warm up! Pretty Christmas stalls & decorations too!",
          "Very picturesque and nice place to walk and watch the boats go by on the canal. Lots of cafes and shops. Some of the side streets have some cool shops and restuarants too. Nice place to take pictures in front of the coloured houses. You can also take a boat ride from here and",
          "This was a nice street with colourful buildings and restauramts along the side of the canal. There was also a number of xmas market stalls selling goods but they had nothing of any particular note that was worth buying. Ok to visit as a sight but that is it really.",
          "Very nice, picturesque, very nice shops for eating and drinking. There were also a bazaar, probably because was Christmas period. Very nice atmosphere",
          "Amazing street. Lots of Christmas stalls. tried a lot of hot wine. Lots of people, super cozy. Watched all the kayaks come down the canal dressed in winter and christmas decorations. it was super lovely. I love this town. I loved that part of it too.",
          "A must for first time visitors to Copenhagen, especially for that typical picture in front of the coloured houses! I'd recommend doing a boat tour down the canal so see lots in a short space of time. Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, and as I visited in December there was",
          "Nyhavn is a very cool place and laid back location for dinner on the waterway. I would suggest a daytime visit because of the different colors and buildings look really nice in the sunlight.",
          "Nyhavn was magical. In December it had a small Christmas market that made it even more magical. The pictures that you see don't do it justice. You have to go and walk around!",
          "It is nice but not comparable with other port areas like Hamburg or Gouna. Food is really average and highly price",
          "Pretty, and full of Christmas cheer, especially when eating outside at sub zero temp with a complimentary blanket over knees and a heater overhead.",
          "Wonderful place to visit, especially at Christmas time. Lots to drink and eat in friendly restaurants",
          "Walked here on a bright, cool, crisp morning. Around 30 minutes walk from the centre. Beautiful buildings in a variety of colours. The canal is awesome running down the centre. There were also some Christmas markets on too which was a great extra. Very touristy so do expect",
          "You've seen it a hundred times in almost any article about Copenhagen, the photo of boats in the canal framed by colorful buildings in the background. This area is close to Kongens Nytorv and the Metro stop of the same name. It's worth a stroll, especially during Christmas time,",
          "I can see why this is such an exciting place to visit. Full of beautiful restaurants! We parked up, had an Aperol Spritz and watched the world go by.",
          "A must see in Copenhagen. Both in the morning and the evening or at night. You cannot miss this place in Copenhagen.",
          "So nice and amazing buildings,,, reflection of different lights to the water during the night is so attractive",
          "Good place. Go there and click photographs, enjoy some quick fast foods and roam around freely. The coloured buildings in the background will look awesome in pics.",
          "We would highly recommend going here for your most instagramable photos. It is definitely windy here so make sure to gear up.",
          "Amazing during Christmas time. The lights were impeccable and despite the cold, the warmth from the restaurants heated up the street. Would definitely recommend going during the Christmas season and enjoying the gl\u00f6g they\u2019re selling.",
          "This place was a must see for us and we don\u2019t regret it. So beautiful full of color and amazing architecture. The Christmas markets there made it even more special. We went on a Saturday which was really crowded everywhere kinda overwhelming especially with children but it\u2019s",
          "Nyhavn is the iconic image you would see if you thought of Copenhagen. Very touristy (similar to the Little Mermaid) but worth a visit! Lots of restaurants, tours, photo ops available.",
          "Nyhavn is a classic Copenhagen sight, with its pretty multi coloured houses side by side along the quayside. Unfortunately it's a scrum of selfie-taking tourists even at night, which makes it quite hazardous for cyclists, who have to swerve round people stepping backwards off",
          "I've been here twice during my Copenhagen stay. It's really nice, with the colored houses, good pictures guaranteed. There was a nice Christmas market!",
          "A visit you must make. For those of us who don\u2019t live in Europe, Nyhavn is typical of what we see on post cards and imagine. So many restaurants and stall to walk past or the choose to dine in or to make a purchase. Very colourful on a bright sunny day.",
          "This place deserves a visit in day time as well as in evening! Beautifully colored houses, canal and lots of history are few things the place can offer. There are canal tours which help understand the history, really good restaurants and street food options! Though beware of",
          "My wife, mother-in-law, and I arrived in Copenhagen on the 24th of November for a week of holiday. We took the Metro (M2) from the airport to Kongens Nytorv station and walked to Nyhavn a few blocks away. As soon as we turned the corned on to Nyhavn we were struck by the",
          "It is like a landmark in Copenhagen, everyone go there a must go to visit this place. This is more like a tourist site and a lot of shops around and the nearby area.",
          "Lovely part of the city for a walk about. Even better they had Christmas markets. Some lovely stalls at the market.",
          "Having lunch outside here is one of the best things we did and surprisingly not as expensive as we thought. You are very close to other tables though so hope you get sat next to nice people.",
          "The \"New Port\" of Copenhagen is one of the most beautiful spots of the city. Everything there is picturious and full with colors. The buildings, the boats, the water and the bridges. A lot of bars, cafes and restaurants. And if you are lucky to find a sunny afternoon you can",
          "Nyhavn is probably the most famous spot in Copenhagen. The colourful buildings, tall ships and peaceful reflections on the water make it a very picturesque spot.",
          "There\u2019s a reading this is the first thing you find when you search pictures of Copenhagen. It\u2019s beautiful! There\u2019s lots of history around this area and a huge anchor to represent the many lives lost of workers of the sea. There\u2019s a great Christmas market here with plenty cute",
          "Very nice place! Love it. There are a lot of bars and restaurants along the street and also a lot of stores selling native things.",
          "The place is as beautiful as what I have seen on YouTube or Google images. Won't get tired of being just there staring at those colourful buildings.",
          "Very busy and almost exclusively for tourists. Interesting architecture and an okay place for a short stroll.",
          "We were lucky as when we went on Monday night, everywhere was empty so we managed photographs with crowd free results. We had to go back in the daytime to appreciate the colours of the houses.",
          "Had a great time here the Xmas decorations are superb and the atmosphere for Xmas was brilliant the light show is well worth watching",
          "Another over rated, over priced bit of Copenhagen. Nothing to recommend it And good luck finding anything to eat if your a vegetarian",
          "Even on a grey, drizzly December morning this place is charming. A waterfront of old bars, restaurants, and, during December, Christmas market stalls. Lovely.",
          "We visited on an incredibly cold and rainy day but were still able to see the area. Very attractive waterfront.",
          "We really loved the atmosphere of this part of the town, so full of life and joy. I couldn't stop to take pictures of the coloured houses and of the caf\u00e9s and restaurants.",
          "I love walking along Nyhavn but had a bad experience tonight. I was walking on the quiet side of the Nyhavn canal when a slender tall man walking with a map in his hand came over and asked me and my partner for directions. We told him we didn't know and he proceeded to ask us",
          "This a beautiful area with lots of bars and shop , we went on a boat ride which was lovely Excellent Christmas markets",
          "Arriving at 6am after a 13 hour flight we wondered how we\u2019d spend our day and decided a walk around Nyhavn would be perfect and it was. We caught the 75 min around trip cruise which provided various language options of commentary. Getting off at 11.15am where we started we took",
          "Very much a tourist maker but I say that in a good way. Whenever you see an article about Copenhagen I look at postcards the image of Nyhaven is always there. Photo genic harbour with tall master barges and hugely colourful houses on either side. Full of restaurants, shops and a",
          "One of the must visit places for photo opportunities in one the best known places in Copenhagen, we were lucky with it being the end of November there was additional Xmas market style outlets in the area adding to the atmosphere",
          "Loved walking around the canal! So pretty with all the Christmas lights. Perfect place to grab dinner and a drink or take a boat ride. One of my favorite stops of my trip!",
          "Visited here twice. Once during a cold and brilliantly sunny day and again in the evening. Lined with lovely multicolored houses next to a river with loads of restaurants. For Christmas there was a charming market selling all kinds of wonderful things. Great for a stroll or",
          "Nyhavn is a wonderful place to stay at Christmas with markets and plenty of Hygge right out the front door! We have thoroughly enjoyed walking up to Kastellet and the little mermaid, touring the canals with Hey Captain and visiting Amalienborg and Christiania. Walked everywhere",
          "There were nice little cottages selling all goodies, gl\u00fcwein, gl\u00f6g, nuts etc. People were walking by the harbor, smiling and having fun. The Christmas lights were colourful and beatiful.",

          "Colourful buildings that line the new harbour are now mostly restaurants and bars. Canal cruise depart from here. Also home to one of the Christmas Markets. Busy area with a new bridge to Christianshavn.",
          "We arrived the week they were setting up for Christmas so we got to see it both ways - before and after both in day and at night . We thought it was lovely at night especially when the Christmas market was set up- it was magical. We had coffee there before it was set up and we",
          "If you have a nice day, take a stroll down the waterfront. It is clean, the people are friendly and the sights are not common to many places. The colorful buildings and canals make for scenic, fun pictures.",
          "Nyhavn is a must see place for any visitor to Copenhagen. It\u2019s a beautiful street with lots of bars, cafes and restaurants. We arrived via the hop on hop off bus service which we would also recommend for any visitor. We visited during the Christmas market season so the street",
          "This was far too mobbed by crowds of people to be enjoyable for me. At times, it was even hard to walk on the sidewalks due the press of people. It is pretty enough, I guess, but there is nothing to really do or see here (other than dining or drinking). I prefer",
          "Perfect place to go around, drink coffee and buy little souvenirs We took a lot of pictures and enjoyed it.",

          "It is an exceptional place to visit. No doubt one of the places you should visit in Copenhagen. The colours are fantastic. During December there is a christmas market with nice local hot drinks ,sweets and souvenirs. Do not miss the boat trip ,it was a great experience. We will",
          "As we visited at the end of November the Christmas market was on here. Definitely worth a visit. Really enjoyable with lots of stalls offering all kinds of gifts and things to keep warm.",
          "Love this area of Copenhagen. So many great restaurants, cafes and shopping Great canal tours available year round This time of year has two lovely Christmas markets right on your doorstep and the D\u2019Angleterre Hotels decorations are not to be missed",
          "wow! What a beauty . A non miss in Copenhagen. The whole place is beautiful. You can take a boat also to go around the city. Place full of nice restaurants. Best place in Copenhagen.",
          "Neat little shopping area. Did not partake in the shops, but did have lunch at Nyhavn Faergekro. Very nice meal with Danish foods. Have Christmas shops lining path as well. Area makes for a nice photo.",
          "We explored the small Christmas Market along the water with a backdrop of the colorful house of Nyhavn. Worth visiting for photos and lunch and the Christmas market if you're there in season. We were there in the 3rd week of November 2019 and the markets were up and running.",
          "It's even more beautiful in person than in the photos. The colored homes, restaurants and shops on the water were truly something. We didn't stay around and eat or anything, but I enjoyed walking around the little strip.",
          "Great place to have dinner by the canal front. Variety of restaurants cater for varied tastes. Very nice ambiance.",
          "This was super cute to go for a walk, I went in winter, I would advise to go for summer. Definitely a spot to chill and eat good food.",
          "This very popular area is even more so during Christmas market season. The crowds are all in good humor with plenty of \"glogg\" on hand. Well worth a visit, best in the evening when the lights take on a greater effect.",
          "Very fabulous place! I never forget it. We had a boat trip down the canal, made a lot of photos and just had a fun",
          "No trip to Copenhagen would be complete without a trip to Nyhavn. I was lucky enough to be there during the winter months with the Christmas decorations and stalls already set up. The Gl\u00f8gg at one of the street carts was basically Christmas in a cup. Returned multiple times to",
          "Nice area, gets very cold when the wind picks up though! Lots of shops and eateries around to look through and eat at. Food is a little more expensive in this area unless you grab something from a market stall vendor. Recommend a boat tour from Nyhavn if you want to know a",
          "This district is a feast for the eyes with the range of pastel coloured buildings all complemented by their impeccable condition along the canal. Incredibly expensive food and beverages were to be expected.",
          "The Christmas huts were out during our visit and the lights looked really pretty. You could walk up and down and the markets were authentic and everyone seemed friendly! At night with the lights and the colourful houses, it changed the whole experience.",
          "The leisurely stroll down the street with beer in hand, your love ones hand in the other. People are great, friendly and helpful. When you arrive to the square you should get a Copenhagen dog with ramoulade sauce on top.",
          "When you see the beauty that surrounds you will exhale. Beautiful vistas from every angle. Shops and restaurants galore. Watch out for the bicycle riders.",
          "With a lot of restaurants, bars and cafes. You\u2019ll find something for your taste, that\u2019s for sure, either in the restaurants or in the booths on the street. Colorful houses with many little details to see everywhere...nice stroll even on a rainy day...",
          "Enjoyed the local bars and cuisine as well as strolling along the Christmas Market stalls. Very pleasant indeed.",
          "Lovely new harbour area, colourful houses a bit like Amsterdam with canal side, overpriced restaurants. A few of the houses lay claims to housing Hans Christian Anderson, tho none of them ring true as apparently he rented and moved around the city quite a bit. We took a 60min",
          "Definitely a small part of Copenhagen one should not miss. The restaurants are quite nice (beware of some tourist traps) and the views excellent. Being able to get a glogg while walking around is nice, too. Plus: there seem to be churros at every other corner. Interesting, I",
          "Sat and had a beer watching the world go by. Restaurants along the canal expensive, so have a drink & find a restaurant away from the canal.",
          "Enjoyed a hot wine when you enter. You can also step into one of the bars and restaurants if you want to have a sit and enjoy the lights outside",
          "Very different from expectation. Lots of visitors and activities going on. Tips: walk along the canal towards the waterfront, it will lead to Inderhavnsbroen bridge, over the bridge there are plenty of restaurants and bars",
          "Popular place, packed with tourists but well worth a visit for the colourful houses, the canal with the boats and the restaurants.",
          "Very touristy but well worth seeing and the Christmas stalls were excellent including the mulled wine",
          "So beautiful near, many places many colorful buildings . A log if restaurants /Bar Cafe This is a must visiting place in Copenhagen.",
          "Wonderful view and architecture. One of the Instagram spot for everyone. A canal tour is best to feel the place.",
          "A visit to Copenhagen would not be complete without a stroll in Nyhavn. Iconic harbour area, where parties have been going on for centuries. Bring your own refreshments and enjoy, or stop at one of the restaurants for coffee, food and/or drinks. Nice any time of year",
          "Very nice views for photography, very relaxing and a great atmosphere! Represents Denmark amazingly!",
          "We spent an evening in the Nyhavn area - very picturesque, and were treated to some lovely music from a busker. Lovely atmosphere and beautiful boats to look at.",
          "Possibly the most photographed area of the city, real chocolate box stuff. There are lots of nice places to eat and drink, but the price can be a little higher than other areas of the city, but for people watching it worth the price.",
          "It is the trademark of the city. It is certainly the most photographed spot in the city.    It is also certain that you will pass not only once. Gorgeous spot Positive aura and serenity, like the whole city.    Worth a visit",
          "Some of the best places to hang out in the evenings in Copenhagen. Surrounded by nice bars and slightly overpriced restaurants (you pay for the view). Perfect place for a drink and to unwind with the tourists and locals alike.",
          "Nyhavn is in the heart of the city, therefore it is almost impossible to forgo. It is massively overcrowded by tourists but the tourist flow ebbs a bit on the very early hours of the day.",
          "Beautiful place to have a stroll through and have a few drinks at the Christmas markets. Loads of little bars and restaurants to soak up the atmosphere",
          "Definitely worth visiting the famous Nyhavn district. You will instantly recognise the colourful houses on the waterfront where you can grab a drink and spend the afternoon people watching!",
          "This is my favorite place from now on. I love the old houses and the cafes and restaurants. Lovely decorations.",
          "We walked up and down on both sides of the water. really nice area, but is very busy liked the painted houses and looking at the boats will come here again",
          "Must seen place in Copenhagen Denmark nice walking tour specially during night and enjoy lights and dinner",
          "The draw to this port in Copenhagen is to get photos of Nyhavn. This is by far the greatest place in Copenhagen to take photos. The price however is not really good enough to eat here. It is way too expensive for the food you receive.",
          "This is heart of this town and most popular street in Copenhagen. Restaurants and bars are all the time full with tourists and local people",
          "Nyhavn is super lovely, colorful and full of cute places to eat and take photos. And it is central. Love it.",
          "The Christmas markets were great and we enjoyed some delicious mulled wine. I don't think a canal boat trip along Nyhavn is necessary, as the views are very much enjoyable by foot.",
          "The Nyhavn is a waterfront/ canal. Loads of boat cruises to choose from as low as 50DKK. Nice buildings to look at and there's a tour guide that pretty much explains everything. It was a bit chilly in October Also the cruise doesnt end back at the Nyhavn",
          "colored buildings, the cafes and restaurants, the many wooden ships in the water. Very very charmy. Visit at night!",
          "Nyhavn is a must place to see when you visit Copenhagen! The buildings are so colorful and beautiful. Very cosy restaurants where you can sit relax and enjoy the Danish food!",
          "My wife and I visited the Nyhavn part of Copenhagen on a cruise ship visit. We used the Hop-On-Hop-Off buses and there was a convenient stop right in the heart of Nyhavn. It's also walkable from the city centre, being around 1 mile from Tivoli Gardens and around 20 minutes'",
          "A very nice afternoon in Nyhavn with my wife together with a lot of people in nice ans friendly atmosphare",
          "Really cool landmark...plenty of restaurants, bars, cafe's and so picturesque. Enjoyed taking in the sights and having a cocktail and bite to eat.",
          "What an amazing and vibrant area of town. Lots of amazing restaurants and shops and even some little food tents with amazing food! This is definitely the area that you think of when you think of Copenhagen with the colorful houses along the canal!",
          "Nyhavn is _the_ place that is most likely to be found on postcards from Copenhagen - just next to the Little Mermaid. It shines especially during the summer - both at day and night - although getting some Christmas wine there in the winter time also has some value. Apart from",
          "This is a nice place especially in the spring, sommer and autum where you are able to sit outside and enjoy the atomsphere. I also love just to take a walk from Kgs Nytorv through Nyhavn and then take the harbor bus (public transport) to the other side of Copenhagen.",

          "The color, the design of the buildings, is very special and with the canals , it give you a nice view. Remeber me of Amsterdam. The restaurants there a little bit expensive.",
          "Wind was blowing and many tourist and locals were walking and taking selfie photos. Lots of F&B oulets all with their own specialty dishes marked.",
          "Like every other tourist, we had to get pictures of Nyhavn (New Port) which was built 300 years ago to attract traffic and allow ships up to the Royal Square. Until 1970, it was a haunt for sailors but, of course, today is home to overpriced restaurants and cafes serving",
          "The coloured houses at Nyhaven are 1 of the iconic images of Copenhagen. It is lovely to stroll by the canalside, look at the scenery and \"people watch\". There is a variety of cafes and restaurants, a little more expensive than elsewhere.",
          "We went for noon meal. it was crowd but we found a lunch spot with seats. The price were higher other restaurants in Copenhagen. There was many colourful historical buildings.",
          "Beautiful spot, lots of restaurants, you can eat and drink outside with blankets if it\u2019s cold. You can go on a boat trip from here which is included in the Copenhagen card.",
          "it was really pretty to walk down. we went late afternoon early evening. the cost of beer here was the highest we encountered. it was however lovely to sit by the canal and have a conversation with my friends ( although the couple we were sat next too went so happy with our",

          "Excellent time, beautiful place, lovely friendly people, extremely clean place will go again very soon. Would definitely recommend",
          "I love walking around here, it is my favourite spot in Copenhagen. I have to come here every time I am in town. Love the atmosphere",

          "Very nice area for a stroll and some lovely restaurants and bars. A bit pricey (but then that is the norm for Copenhagen) and it well worth a visit.",
          "Nyhavn has a canal dating from 1673 which is situated in the center of Copenhagen with a variety of restaurants and bars. The views of the Nyhavn canal and boats are what you will find on postcards as both sides of the canal are lined with colorful houses and stylish yachts and",
          "Lovely picturesque area with brightly coloured buildings. This is an area with lots of restaurants and bars. There are some great signs so look up as you walk around too. Short distance to the citadel and little mermaid and to Tivoli in the other direction. In October it was not",
          "Very colorful and characteristic, many restaurants and bars for drinking and listening to music. the liveliest area in the center of Copenhagen.",
          "This is definitely a wonderful area to stroll. The colourful buildings and relaxed atmosphere makes for a great visit. Peak season may get a bit crowded with tourists but in mid October, the number of people was perfect - enough to add atmosphere without being crowded. There",
          "The most amazing part of Copenhagen. Lots of cafes and restaurants. Nice for walking and relaxing. Absolutely must see!",
          "Wanted to visit here after seeing all wonderful pictures of Nyhavn. I arrived here bit late but the whole place was lively and colorful. Restaurants and pubs run along the coastline and wish I could have dinner here but sadly already I had dinner elsewhere. Place is really",
          "Iconic place in Copenhagen. It use to be a channel with medieval businessmen offices on shore. Now it\u2019s coloristic and very touristic place. Bright colors of 3-4 floors wooden facades are mirroring in the water of channel, which creates cheerful atmosphere. There are lots of",

          "I\u2019ve been told this is a compulsory stop when in Copenhagen and now I completely agree! It\u2019s just so beautiful walking down the harbour alongside the cheerfully coloured buildings. There are many restaurants and bar that lined harbour, making us spoilt for choice. Will",

          "The best in town. Centric, old but well conserved. During Christmas it holds one of the Christmas markets of the city. Restaurants are very touristic though, never tried it, but not sure it's worth it",

          "Nyhavn is probably the most happening place in Copenhagen. We went in October, and there were plenty of people there, yet anyone we asked said that this was nothing compared to the height of the tourist season. The bustling canal front cafes and street performers provide a",
          "Beautiful location worth seeing for a picture. Restaurants are overpriced and quite frankly not good. Boat tour was free with our Copenhagen Card which left from here but was also highly underwhelming. Come for a quick picture but don't plan on being here longer than 15 minutes.",
          "Lovely area and really nice feel to it. We struggled to find some place to eat that was reasonably priced and suitable for children. We did a canal boat cruise which was very enjoyable.",

          "Very nice area and nice to see all the boats and the building in different colours. very touristy as you can imagine but still worth coming over to see and getting the photos",
          "We visited a couple of times in the day and also in the evening. It was a little crowded on Saturday afternoon but both of our other visits were much quieter. We had lunch at one of the bars which was no more expensive than other places in the city and we also had coffees and",
          "This is a must stop if you\u2019re in Copenhagen. Looks just like all the pictures you see. Loved sitting at an outside cafe enjoying a latte and watching the boats and people go by. I enjoyed it late morning early afternoon before the crowds got too bad than I\u2019d walk around the",

And at",

          "This is of course going to be a stop off point on everyones tour of Copenhagen! The harbourside can be a target for a lot of rubbish even though there are lots of bins around the area. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars where you can sit and watch the world go",
          "This part of Copenhagen is very pretty but it is just the one street which was disappointing. It is very crowded and has lots of bars/restaurants. The river cruise takes you up it too so can be viewed from the boat. Pretty, just smaller than expected.",

          "We visited Nyhaven by boat and on foot, and it is absolutely stunning. The colourful buildings are beautiful, and the history which surrounds the area makes it well worth a visit. There are cafes and restaurants all along the waterfront for you to take time out people watch,",
          "Nyhavn is accessible from the centre of Copenhagen and is a relatively short walk. We passed through the area a couple of times during over five day stay in Copenhagen and found it to be busy on each occasion. There is a good selection of restaurants and cafes but the menus have",

          "We enjoyed a beautiful afternoon browsing through Nyhavn. It's a great place to enjoy the many cafes that line the canal or to just people watch and soak up the atmosphere. It's a stop on the on/off buses and the on/off canal tours. It's worth a visit.",
          "A really beautiful picturesque place! My son and I visited twice during a short four day holiday. And my Moonpig birthday card on the day after the holiday contained an image of Nyhavn taken by my son. A classic shot of water, yachts and multi-coloured houses. Wonderful! OK,",
          "Located alongside picturesque canaal this place is full of excellent dining options, very nice for a walk with beautiful views.",
          "Always drawn to Nyhavn when we visit Copenhagen. It\u2019s bustling, beautiful and a definite must see. So many people, restaurants and boats, lots to look at. It\u2019s very special on a sunny day. The pictures are always postcard worthy!",
          "Amazing location in the city with great bars & restaurants. When in Denmark it\u2019s important to get a smorreboard, a little expensive on the nyhavn but worth it due to location",
          "Walk-behind into the nieghbourhood, many great boutiques, and restaurants. The side streets were more interesting and less touristy.",
          "If you don't like tourists: don't go. This is where the sightseeing boats leave from and all the tourists visit. But it's al lovely, charming spot with nice restaurants, nothing special, but worth the visit when you're in Copenhagen.",
          "Walking and eating here is truly an experience to remember. Picturesque architecture, people from across the globe and a great vibe combine so well here!",
          "A very nice place to share with friends or family. The view is so beautiful and you can eat and drink in many restaurants",

          "We did a lunch here which was great, and one is spoiled for chi]oice when it comes to bars and restaurants. Great place to watch the world go by.",
          "If you're looking for a scenic view and a place to eat or have a coffee, this is it. If you're looking for something else, this isn't it. There's not much else to do. But it's worth visiting.",
          "Nyhavn took my breath away since the first moment I saw it. It looks like a rainbow and, who doesn't love rainbows. And at night, it is even more beautiful.",
          "We enjoyed visiting Nyhavn and taking a trip on one of the canal boats which was excellent. However, we would not eat there as all the restaurants made you sit outside among the smokers.",
          "This is a lovely area full of restaurants and bars amongst cafes and souvenir shops but it is not \u2018tacky\u2019. Lovely setting with boats either side of the Canal some of which are restaurants. Colourful buildings adorn both sides so good for photo opportunities. Nice place to enjoy",
          "A lovely and beautiful site, worth a visit in summer, Copenhagen is very expensive city. A taxi from the airport to the apartment cost $ 100. 3 cups of coffee = 25 euros",
          "This section of Copenhagen is iconic for a reason! The buildings are so quaint and historic. We did a canal tour, then lunch at one of the many restaurants (so hard to choose!) then put a lock on the bridge!!! It seems very central to a lot of other places to visit too!",
          "Lots of restaurants to choose from and boat rides ect. Probably better in the summer but worth going and having a walk up and down.",
          "Buy a drink in one of the riverside restaurants and watch the world go by, the boats bobbing about and bustle of this lovely place.",
          "The Nyhavn village was one of the highlights of our visit to Copenhagen! Although we did not dine here, we discovered an open air tour boat and decided to take a wonderful tour of the city canals and see some of the wonderful sights of Copenhagen. The tour boats are located",
          "A quaint area that is exactly what you imagine when you think of Copenhagen...canals, colourful buildings, boats, a bridge laden with locks where couples declare their undying love!!! There are lots of cafes to grab a bite to eat & sit & enjoy the view and it's an easy walk to",
          "Love Nyhavn with the beautiful water and lovely brightly colored buildings. Great place to do some people watching and/or start a canal boat tour",
          "A great place to photograph but a little expensive to stop and eat. Most of the restaurants were quite pricey. The view was better from the opposite side of the canal. Very trendy and the prices match.",
          "This is a lovely, lively, trendy area to explore. Lots of shops and restaurants. The city as a whole is expensive.",
          "Just beautiful walking along the water. Beautiful colours, lots of music and people wandering along. It just seems like such the quintessential place to go - worth the time.",
          "This is a bit of a tourist trap, but worth the visit for the atmosphere. You should definitely visit and have a Danish beer sitting by the water. I would classify the restaurants as \"OK\" but this is a bit of a tourist trap and Copenhagen has much better to offer.",
          "We really enjoyed seeing the beautifully brightly colored painted buildings! The canal tour is a must!",
          "We visited Nyhavn a couple of times when we were in Copenhagen, and had lunch twice at Number 41. Very relaxed atmosphere and a great place to chill and watch the boats. If it gets too cold they have blankets and patio heaters to keep you warm.",
          "This is an attractive area that appears on many postcards but, unfortunately, was the spot where my wife's purse was stolen. It's a sorry fact that pickpockets operate in most of the major tourist cities, so I'm not singling out Copenhagen which, overall, is a lovely city. So...",
          "I had seen images of Nyhavn for years, so it was awesome to finally be there in person. It was such a great quaint looking area with great restaurants lining the wharf. Yes, it was crowded, but we expected that is it was not a disappointment in any way. Overall, a great energy",
          "Great place for a stroll and take some nice photos. The last known residence of Hans Christian Anderson is located here as well. It is just beside a HC Anderson gift shop so do drop by as well.",
          "Best pictures in Copenhagen are the ones in Nhavn. It is wonderful to see ships beside the pubs and the atmosphere is great.",
          "We arrived Nyhavn with the canal ride. There are so many houses and boats along the river. It is definitely a must go and also a great place to take photos. The roads are busy but not too crowded. We decided to take scooter to leave and it was also a good great way to travel.",
          "Walking along Nyhavn is an essential experience if you are visiting Copenhagen! It's just gorgeous with the boats, colorful buildings and all the people. We enjoyed a great lunch along the canal, took a canal boat ride (highly recommended also - it was included with the",
          "But a lot of tourist, be mentaly prepared. Buildings and ships are beautiful, great place to take pictures.",
          "No matter who I have brought to this place, they have all loved it. Its very colorful and the atmosphere is amazing. Lots of nice places to get something to drink or eat. Or just sit by the harbour and watch the boats.",
          "On our tenth day (25 Sept 2019 Thu) after arrival at Scandnavia was on Copenhagen tour. On our walking tour to Nyhavn was worth it even in drizzle as the beautiful and colourful traditional buildings were real picturesque. This is the landmark of Copenhagen. A must visit sight",
          "A 'must-see' in Copenhagen although it looks nothing like the rest of the city. it worth it for sure but we actually walk around the canal but avoided sitting in a any bars/restaurants in the area as they are expensive and super crowed. Take some pictures and move on with your",
          "Definitely an ideal place for photography. Really a popular place for that and to wine and dine. Would totally recommend going there!",
          "A photo of this waterfront is in every book and on every website when Copenhagen is mentioned. So much to see. Lots of places to eat and drink. Take a cruise. People watch. It's all here.",
          "The Danes love their food and drink and this waterfront area tells it all. An abundance of restaurants all with patios overlooking the canal. Was wonderful!",
          "Great place to spend a lazy afternoon. Walk around the boardwalk (salsa dancing at on-ramp spot) to see the playhouse across the water, keep going past the fountain to Amalienborg Palace",
          "Worth going to once if you are visiting Copenhagen. Very picturesque, with an opportunity to stroll or sit outside for beer if the weather is good. I\u2019m not sure what it is like during colder months, but I know it is almost overcrowded during summer months, which makes it",
          "The area of Nyhavn itself is a street with a canal running down the middle of it. On one end there is a bridge where people have taken to putting love locks on, and you can buy padlocks near by if this is your thing. The rows of houses up the street are different colours, they",
          "It's a 100% tourist place so it's a little crowded but it's really beautiful anyway. There are a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants there (some of them are expensive, but there's also street food). It's the start of many boat tours, some of them go out every 15 minutes for 50",
          "Bustling pavement restaurants serving Danish cuisine. Sit and watch the world go by. Choices of local beers and cocktails.",
          "Very beautiful, even with a lot of people that fill all the places along the waterfront. The place is quite touristic, but that doesn\u2019t steal the enchanting atmosphere.",
          "If you are looking for love and color, this is the place and don\u2019t forget the lock \u2764\ufe0f. Lovely place and kind people",
          "If you're coming to Copenhagen you'll definitely find yourself in Nyhavn. It's one of the most photographed areas of town and you can see why. Personally, I found hanging out in the area to be a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of people in the area and most of the",
          "We kept returning here, as it is fairly central to the city so we were often passing through at different times. It was interesting to see how the character of Nyhavn changes from day to night. Plenty of places to eat and drink, with excellent ice cream from Vaffelbageren.",
          "Nice place to visit if you want to eat or drink but very expensive. Probably one of the spurs to see but better places to stop for a drink than this",
          "The buildings have retained their traditional appearance although all are cafes and restaurants now. You can see what it would have been like when it was a traditional working harbour. Lovely to spend an afternoon strolling around and the sun came out which was a rare occurrence",
          "After having seen places like this in argenyina, soweto etc i didnt find anything new about colorful facade of buildings. Location near canal side also doesnt add much to it like it does in switzerland. Still the area has its charm mostly because tourists hang around and various",
          "The most beautiful area in Copenhagen. We enjoyed in food, beer and atmosphere there. Well organized.",

          "Not to miss spot for taking beautiful pictures and trying out local food when in Copenhagen. The canal tours from there are very good in giving a good overall tour of the city.",
          "Special in the late summertimes. But it\u2019s a expensive place. But normally it got a good vibe... but mostly in the summer.",
          "This is a fun part of Copenhagen. It is lined with outdoor cafes where you can have a drink or a meal. There are boats tied up along the channel. The channel is between very colorful, old houses and many harbor cruises leave from this area. It is a perfect spot to come",
          "Be prepared to barely move at the weekends, constantly stopping as people in front of you try multiple shots to perfect their Insta post. Weekdays seemed quieter. Great for people watching and observing the obsession of the modern era. As a historical area, take a wander off",
          "This is a beautiful area along the canal where HC Anderson used to live in several locations. One side is lined by restaurants and pubs and Greta for people watching. The buildings are colorful and the scene is a worthwhile location to visit.",
          "Fantastic, if pricy area. Wonderful for a beer in the sunshine.... Carlsberg...of course! Do as the locals do and buy beer in the supermarket and sit on the edge of the canal to soak up the sunshine.",
          "Wherever we go in Scandinavia, we never get tired of seeing the assortment of colored houses next to the water. I believe they originated by an influx of germanic traders, back in the day. The area is always packed with tourtists, but worth a visit. If you only have limited",
          "A beautiful place in Copenhagen, maybe the most picturesque with it's colorful buildings lining the wharf. However it does depend what time you visit and what you want out of your visit. The crowds can be overwhelming during most times of the day especially on a hot day. The",

          "This is THE place to feel like Copenhagen. It is in all the typical photos of the city so take a camera. The waterfront is crowded (we were there in July). Some of the buildings along the waterfront are from the 1600's so it is very picturesque. This is where the boat tours",
          "If you are in Copenhagen, you have absolutely walking in. The Canal with colored houses around is lovely during the day and night. It is full of restaurants/pubs and people of course.",
          "Beautiful area, with lots of restaurants although very expensive to have a meal there. Beautiful at sunset, with the boats and water and bridges",
          "Nyhavn is one of the charming spots in the city. Yes of course it is touristy and gets busy, but the picturesque and colourful setting is the most famous spot in Copenhagen. Don't miss the world's oldest functioning tattoo parlour and the house where HC Andersen used to live.",
          "So much goes on in this tiny part of Copenhagen. The water vessels, the water fowl, the bra and restaurants and historic buildings. The exteriors provide a great backdrop for your travel photos. Pick up your canal ride at Nyhavn and grab a bit of the flavor of Copenhagen from",
          "Many restaurants serving a variety of food from traditional Swedish to Italian and American diner. Great atmosphere with indoor and outdoor options at most venues",
          "Beautiful multi-colored wooden houses line the wharf. There are many cafes to eat along this wharf. Expensive tourist area.",
          "Great Waffle place along our walk. People are pleasant as well, as you get down to the end of the walk it got a little sketchy. Stay in the beginning of the walk.",
          "We took advantage of a tour boat ride that was included on our Copenhagen Card. This is absolutely the best way to see Nyhavn and the beautiful architecture lining the marina. Their are many shops and restaurants and quick eateries here (can never go wrong with Danish ice",
          "Great area with lots of fantastic, colourful buildings. However, even in September the area was crowded with tourists. And food there will be more expensive as they hike it up for tourists. Still worth a sightseeing visit though",
          "It\u2019s only 2 streets, not much too see except the colourful buildings by sides. A lot of restaurants if you want to have a leisurely lunch or dinner.",
          "Whilst looking out of our hotel, No. 71 late at night you can imagine how it was when Hans Christian Anderson lived here. No horrible new developments, almost as if nothing\u2019s changed. And such a fantastic atmosphere! Loved it! Incidentally I went in Mar h, out of season so",
          "This is the classic Instagram shot or postcard picture. It is just beautiful. Plenty of places to eat here as well.",
          "We loved Nyhavn. It\u2019s very picturesque. There were quite a few tourists but that didn\u2019t deter taking photos.",
          "After you have walked along the restaurants in Nyhavn, remember to walk on the opposite side of the canal so you se all of the old beautiful houses in Nyhavn. Also to to the end of the canal and cross the bridge to Christianshavn for a whole different experince in another part",
          "We stopped while on a bike tour and it was very crowded with tourists on Saturday. Mostly restaurants, no shoppers really. We walked back on Sunday to have lunch at a traditional danish restaurant Told & Snaps, very nice experience lunching here and no line at ice cream shop",

          "It\u2019s ranked number 1 attraction in Copenhagen in TripAdvisor with good reasons. It\u2019s a great place for friends and families to hang out - if you are not shy of crowd. I went for dinner shortly before sunset, it was a better experience than mid-afternoon when I passed by this",
          "Its a busy town but quite pleasant. Good for a photo shoot. Goods are expensive yet we have to expect that as Copenhagen is one of the expensive towns in the world.",
          "This was my favourite part of my trip to Copenhagen! I've never been to a place like it. We just chilled out in Nyhavn for a few hours and without knowing the time had flown by. I definitely recommend it at sunset, it's beautiful and the bright buildings are simple yet also",
          "This is charming and very photogenic but be warned this is not where the locals choose to eat.It has become far too commercial and no longer resembles Copenhagen.",
          "We visited Copenhagen with a couple of friends during our cruise tour. Lovely city with lot of sites to see. Nehaven was one of the best. I surely recommend to visit and to take a ferry boat tour",
          "Nice place to visit when in Copenhagen. Very pleasant for a walk and a wonder. If lucky with the weather, it's nice to have a drink, though you do pay tourist prices. You pay for the location!",
          "Nyhavn is a pretty cool area even if it's full of tourists. Lots of small restaurants where you can have a meal and watch people walk by. It won't necessarily be your best meal ever but it's a great place to sit and look around. I would recommend it.",
          "A definite must if visiting Denmark. Lots of great places to have a meal and/or a drink. Also a close walk to the Inderhavnsbroen Bridge.",
          "It's a cool and unique place by the water. \"the CPH\" look. It's especially beautiful at sunset but it's also very crowded. If you don't mind a large crowd it's great.",

          "Good place to eat or just have a beer, take the canal boat for a really interesting trip around the canal networks. We used the Hop on Off one.",
          "It's like this in all Cities around the work. The most traditional beautiful postcard scenes are full... stocked full of tourists and Nyhavn is no exception. I love it.. beautiful buildings, boats and just a snapshot of history.. although I couldn't help myself being behind",

          "The Nyhavn is a nice, bustling place in the center of Copenhagen. You can take the boat tours starting from here. If you take boat tour, be sure to get down at the Reffen to enjoy delicious cuisines from around the world. The restaurants at Nyhavn are expensive as its a typical",

          "Charming architecture, picturesque canal, 1,000 restaurants and every tourist in Copenhagen. It's a must see area during your visit, although you will probably dine much better (and less expensively) as you move farther from the canal side streets. Nyhavn is very, very pretty",

          "So much to see and do here. Everywhere you look there is something happening from buskers, to market sellers, lovely restaurants and cafes, artworks and little shops selling all sorts of goods and local produce. A very vibrant hub for the tourist to visit and definitely a must",

          "This is a very pleasant area to visit, we ended up there twice. It is the spot you go for the canal cruise and the area of many restaurants and bars. We found all the restaurants expensive, tourist venues that in essence were a touch disappointing. That all said, a great spot",
          "It\u2019s three or four blocks of attractive multicolored buildings, numerous eating establishments and tons of tourists. Walk through, take the obligatory photo, and move on. Uninspiring.",

          "We visited here while on a city tour recently. It's clearly orientated towards dining and tourism, but it has an enjoyable vibe. Be prepared to overpay at the restaurants, but if you're not local it's probably one of the things that are worth doing.",
          "This small area of Copenhagen is very pretty, and perfect for that holiday photo, but as a result it is very busy with tourists. Trying to take a picture without loads of people walking in front of the camera is a bit tricky. That said, the City has kindly provided two raised",

        "wiki": "Copenhagen (Danish: K\u00f8benhavn [k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8h\u0251w\u02c0n] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality. It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.\nOriginally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the \u00d8resund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, Arres\u00f8, lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the City Hall Square.\nCopenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\nThe Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway) and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannah\u01ebfn [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannah\u00f6fn [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be \"chapman's haven\". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen.\n(English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish k\u00f6pman, Danish k\u00f8bmand, Icelandic kaupma\u00f0ur: in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin caupo, \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is K\u00f6penhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestr\u00e6de have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Str\u00f8get meets R\u00e5dhuspladsen.\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. \nThe natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century. The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, K\u00f8bmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158\u20131191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177\u20131201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\n\nIn disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malm\u00f6 and L\u00fcbeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\nDuring the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the T\u00f8jhus Arsenal and B\u00f8rsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundet\u00e5rn. In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nCopenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of H\u00f8jbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nOn 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have \"put the telescope to the blind eye\" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.\n\nThe Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August \u2013 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.\n\nThe British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture. In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: S\u00f8erne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892\u201394. Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen. The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901\u201302.As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be \"a model protectorate\" and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.The attack, known as \"Operation Carthage\", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren). However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.\n\n\n==== Post-war decades ====\nShortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five \"fingers\" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes. With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nSince the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 have been connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students. Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller on behalf of the A.P. M\u00f8ller foundation, was completed in 2004. In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCopenhagen is part of the \u00d8resund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden. It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the \u00d8resund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malm\u00f6 and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen. By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of N\u00e6stved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sj\u00e6llands Odde.The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (F\u00e6stningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it. Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams S\u00f8, Peblinge S\u00f8 and Sankt J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8.Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city. During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nAmager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre. In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb\u202f). Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 \u00b0C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year. Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F).Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsomr\u00e5det) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Br\u00f8ndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, R\u00f8dovre, T\u00e5rnby and Vallensb\u00e6k as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Fures\u00f8 municipalities, along with the cities of Ish\u00f8j and Greve Strand. They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (R\u00e5dhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.\nCopenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele): Indre By, \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager \u00d8st, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, \u00d8restad, Nordhavnen, Bellah\u00f8j, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Ryparken, and Vigerslev.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nMost of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Drag\u00f8r and T\u00e5rnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (S\u00f8- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politig\u00e5rden building built in 1918\u201324 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.\n\n\n=== Environmental planning ===\n\nCopenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.\n\nCopenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20\u201330% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving. Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.\n\n\n== Demographics and society ==\n\nCopenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen K\u00f8benhavn) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Drag\u00f8r, Frederiksberg, and T\u00e5rnby. Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016).The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016). There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%). There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016). The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially. Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016). The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan. Since the opening of the \u00d8resund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the \u00d8resund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures. The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000\u2013200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in N\u00f8rrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues. There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684. Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Quality of living ===\nFor a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies. In elevating Copenhagen to \"most liveable city\" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning. However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCopenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of \u20ac120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.\n\nSeveral financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.\n\nLife science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the \u00d8resund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malm\u00f6 harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port (CMP). The central location in the \u00d8resund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe. Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors. The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year. 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015. In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city). However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions. The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals. B\u00f8rsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller\u00f8d are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner N\u00f8rrebro, Inner \u00d8sterbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.Sometimes referred to as \"the City of Spires\", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the \"dragon spire\" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.\nRecent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. \u00d8restad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens and zoo ===\n\nCopenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all. It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F\u00e6lledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner \u00d8resund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner N\u00f8rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the N\u00f8rrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.\n\n\n=== Landmarks by district ===\n\n\n==== Indre By ====\nThe historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundet\u00e5rn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Str\u00f8get, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from R\u00e5dhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on \u00d8ster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.\n\n\n==== Christianshavn ====\n\nChristianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on \"Pusher Street\" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.\n\n\n==== Vesterbro ====\n\nVesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants. The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8, one of the Copenhagen lakes. Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The former cattle market \u00d8ksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography. Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969. Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.\n\n\n==== N\u00f8rrebro ====\n\nN\u00f8rrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd halfway up N\u00f8rrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.\n\n\n==== \u00d8sterbro ====\n\nJust north of the city centre, \u00d8sterbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from N\u00f8rrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.\n\n\n==== Frederiksberg ====\n\nFrederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of N\u00f8rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg All\u00e9 connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.\n\n\n==== Amagerbro ====\nAmagerbro (also known as S\u00f8nderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs. Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4\u20137 floors. Further south follows the Sundby\u00f8ster and Sundbyvester districts.\n\n\n==== Hellerup ====\n\nHellerup is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of \u00d8sterbro and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along Strandvejen (a street and further north a road leading to Elsinore) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of Gentofte. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.\n\n\n==== Other districts ====\nNot far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west fa\u00e7ade is reminiscent of a church organ.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nApart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.\n\nAnother important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France. Besides its sculpture collections, the museum also holds a comprehensive collection of paintings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec as well as works by the Danish Golden Age painters.Louisiana is a Museum of Modern Art situated on the coast just north of Copenhagen. It is located in the middle of a sculpture garden on a cliff overlooking \u00d8resund. Its collection of over 3,000 items includes works by Picasso, Giacometti and Dubuffet. The Danish Design Museum is housed in the 18th-century former Frederiks Hospital and displays Danish design as well as international design and crafts.Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, dedicated to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who lived and worked in Rome; the Cisternerne museum, an exhibition space for contemporary art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels; and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens. Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world. The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.\n\nCopenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as caf\u00e9s and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as \"best concert venue in Europe\" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250. Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.Copenhagen is home to the \"K-Town\" punk and hardcore music community. This community developed around the underground scene venue Ungdomshuset in the late 1990s punk scene, with punk- and hardcore acts such as Snipers, Amdi Petersens Arm\u00e9, Gorilla Angreb, Young Wasteners, and No Hope for the Kids emerging as significant bands. The term \"K-town\" got international recognition within the punk-scene with the emergence of \"K-Town\" festivals. In 2001, the first of these was held in Ungdomshuset, on Jagtvej 69, N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen. The festival temporarily moved to Freetown Christiania after Ungdomshuset was evicted from its original location until a new Ungdomshuset location was opened on Dortheavej 61.For free entertainment one can stroll along Str\u00f8get, especially between Nytorv and H\u00f8jbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMost of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684\u20131754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter H\u00f8eg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15\u201318 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (K\u00f8benhavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the \u00d8stre Anl\u00e6g park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the \u00d8sterport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ish\u00f8j. Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus R\u00f8rbye (1803\u20131848), Christen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848) and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860\u20131934).A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-C\u00e9sar Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris. Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAs of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den R\u00f8de Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Gr\u00f8nbech & Churchill, S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans K\u00e6lder, Rel\u00e6, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014, sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d \u2013 a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.\n\n\n=== Nightlife and festivals ===\n\nCopenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously. Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in N\u00f8rrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gef\u00e4hrlich, which also serves as a bar, caf\u00e9, restaurant, and art gallery.Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in F\u00e6lledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators. Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshale\u00f8en in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square. Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.\n\n\n=== Amusement parks ===\n\nCopenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world. Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943. Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCopenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students), Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students), Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each), Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students), KEA (c. 4,500 students), IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen (2,300 students).The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479. It attracts some 1,500 international and exchange students every year. The Academic Ranking of World Universities placed it 30th in the world in 2016.The Technical University of Denmark is located in Lyngby in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. In 2013, it was ranked as one of the leading technical universities in Northern Europe. The IT University is Denmark's youngest university, a mono-faculty institution focusing on technical, societal and business aspects of information technology.The Danish Academy of Fine Arts has provided education in the arts for more than 250 years. It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.\nThere are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby. FC K\u00f8benhavn plays at Parken in \u00d8sterbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Br\u00f8ndby plays at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Br\u00f8ndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.\n\nCopenhagen has several handball teams\u2014a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the \"highest\" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup). The K\u00f8benhavn H\u00e5ndbold women's club has recently been established. Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, R\u00f8dovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August. This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship. In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services. October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.\n\n\n=== Road, rail and ferry ===\nCopenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the \u00d8resund Bridge. The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic. The \u00d8resund train links Copenhagen with Malm\u00f6  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nCopenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway. In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. N\u00f8rreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis, and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Br\u00f8ndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nCopenhaden has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants. In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year. The city's bicycle paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have their own signal systems \u2013 giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nPromoting health is an important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its \"Long Live Copenhagen\" (L\u00e6nge Leve K\u00f8benhavn) scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities. The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.Copenhagen University Hospital forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in Region Hovedstaden and Region Sj\u00e6lland, together with the faculty of health sciences at the University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet and Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals. Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital, and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy. In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions. It benefits from the presence of in-service students of medicine and other healthcare sciences, as well as scientists working under a variety of research grants. The hospital became internationally famous as the location of Lars von Trier's television horror mini-series The Kingdom. Bispebjerg Hospital was built in 1913, and serves about 400,000 people in the Greater Copenhagen area, with some 3,000 employees. Other large hospitals in the city include Amager Hospital (1997), Herlev Hospital (1976), Hvidovre Hospital (1970), and Gentofte Hospital (1927).\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMany Danish media corporations are located in Copenhagen.

        "wiki": "The Cave and Basin National Historic Site of Canada is located in the town of Banff, Alberta, within the Canadian Rocky Mountains, at the site of natural thermal mineral springs around which Canada's first national park, Banff National Park, was established.\n\n\n== Geology and setting ==\nThe Cave and Basin is the lowest component of nine sulphurous hot springs clustered in three groups on the northeast flank of Sulphur Mountain.  All are located along the Sulphur Mountain Thrust Fault below Devonian limestones. The water is heated geothermally from an estimated depth of three kilometres.  The Cave and Basin is the only cavern large enough to comfortably accommodate groups of people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHuman habitation in this area can be traced back to 10,700 years BP with the retreat of the last great glaciation, and it is unlikely that the hot springs escaped being noticed. The first recorded reference to hot springs here is by James Hector of the Palliser Expedition in 1859, followed by Joe Healey in 1874 who found the Cave and Basin site in 1875. But it was Canadian Pacific Railway workers William McCardell and Frank McCabe who brought national attention to the Cave and Basin.  In 1883 they descended through the skylight entrance into the cave using a felled tree, and the following year constructed a small cabin nearby with the intention of commercializing the Cave and Basin site. Conflicting claims by other parties prompted intervention by the Canadian government headed by John A. Macdonald, and in 1885 an order-in-council reserved 10 square miles (26 km2) around the Cave and Basin, the Banff Hot Springs Reserve. This was the genesis of Canada's national parks system. In 1886 the Canadian government held an inquiry into the various private claims to settle on compensation.\nIn 1886 an artificial tunnel was driven into the Cave and Basin to aid visitation. In 1912 bottled water from the Cave and Basin site was sold for its alleged curative powers.  In 1914 a naturally heated swimming pool was opened to the public and continued to operate until 1994.\nThe Cave and Basin was formally declared a national historic site in 1981. Canada's national parks system celebrated its centennial in 1985, on the anniversary of the order-in-council that established the original reserve around the Cave and Basin.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe built facilities include an artificial tunnel to natural grotto, a replica of the original 1887 bathhouse, the restored 1916 swimming pool  and structure, interpretive displays, hiking and snowshoe trails.  The 1887 bathhouse, the first structure on the site, proved inadequate by 1902, and a new pool was built in 1904. The stone bathhouse was completed in 1914, designed by architect Walter S. Painter. The pools were closed in 1975, restored in 1985, then closed again in 1992. An interpretive center now uses the structures.  The Banff Upper Hot Springs is a separate facility some 5 km (3 mi) southeast of the Cave and Basin.\nMany of the early structures were built by detainees held at a World War I Ukrainian Canadian internment camp located nearby. The camp held citizens of countries with which Canada was at war at the time, and had a significant Ukrainian contingent. A permanent exhibit about Canada's first national internment operations was opened at the Cave and Basin site, postponed three months by extensive flooding across southern Alberta, on 13 September 2013, with an address by Jason Kenney, Minister of Employment and Social Development and Minister for Multiculturalism.\n\n\n== Environmental ==\n\nAlmost all of the delicate cave formations had been stripped out of the Cave and Basin immediately following its 'discovery'. According to articles in the Calgary Herald at the time, the construction of the artificial tunnel was contentious even in 1887. In 1924 western mosquitofish were introduced into the hot springs in an attempt to control mosquitos. Tropical fish illegally introduced into the lower springs by local aquarium enthusiasts may have contributed to the extinction of the Banff longnose dace.  Cave and Basin hot springs are also notable as the habitat for the Banff Springs snail, listed as an endangered species in 2000 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCaves of the Canadian Rockies and Columbia Mountains J Rollins, Rocky Mountain Books, 2004\nPhysical and Chemical Properties of the Sulphur Mountain Thermal Springs, Banff National Park, and Implications for Endangered Snails Stephen E.

          "Interesting Nature Walk and Historical Tour. We stopped here briefly to see the outside exhibits. Our visitors did not have much energy left, so we did not go too far, nor did we tour the inside attraction.",
          "We had a a great time visiting the site last week - we got the thermal pass so we also went to the hot springs pool. But it was great to see how it all started! It was brilliant to get to go into the cave, and then read about the history behind the site. There was a fun winter",
          "You get to see the original cave. There is a large interpretive exhibit which outlines the history and significance of the site.",
          "Wish this place had more to offer ... probably the only place in banff that was underwhelming and over hyped... for pictures from our trip follow us on instagram @ bhavnaandshahaan thank you",
          "This is a small attraction. The place where Banff was discovered. You can see the cave and hot spring that was discovered by 3 CP train workers. Beware of the sulphur odor! It can be overwhelming at both the cave and the basin outside. Water is pretty cool to see and you",
          "Very small, felt like a tourist trap, even though it was inexpensive. I have no idea how others stayed for hours and why it gets such great reviews. The picture below is the cave, there is another hot pool, which is the basin, and then there are boards you can read. We did enjoy",
          "We had a trip booked for the afternoon and decided to walk up to the Cave and Basin which is about a 45min stroll from the other side of town. Basically it\u2019s where the story of Banff springs started and you can still see the place where the hot sulphur spring comes to the",
          "We enjoyed stopping in, and seeing the hot springs. The museum, itself, is small, but one can walk around the park, also.",
          "We popped up to the Cave and Basin area after walking the Marsh Loop. There were 2 free boardwalks. The upper one took you to the springs and telling you the history of the site. The lower focused more on the local plants and animals. We were really impressed with these free",
          "We visited this site in the early afternoon. There were guided tours you could join for a small cost. We went on our own and looked at the small cave, then walked through the interpretive centre, which was quite interesting. There were Park's Canada employees talking to tourists",
          "This cave and basin tour was one of our first cave experiences. We enjoyed it as a family with small kids except for the strong rotten egg smell.",
          "This was my wife's and my first visit to Cave and Basin--I'm a bit of a history buff and so I enjoyed learning about the history of Canada's first national park. We were looking around and one of the Parks staff came up and asked if we had any questions. We engaged him in",
          "Take the time to read everything and talk to the amazingly helpful staff. There are many boardwalks throughout the park, and a few areas to wait and watch local birds. We saw horse trail excursions when the. Just a real good place for an early morning visit before the crowds.",
          "Don\u2019t expect to much from this tour. It\u2019s $4 per person, kids under 17 go in free. A gift shop is in front of the actual building where the cave is enclosed. The smell of sulphuric is not for sensitive noses. Snails are protected and sit on floating leaves on the outside of",
          "Went to Cave and Basin for a hike to the Sundance Canyon, the hike is well worth doing, but the real gem is visiting the cave and seeing the audio visual and static displays chronicling the discovery of the cave, the start of Parks Canada and a must do is spending some time at",
          "The cave is quite small, but pretty. Interesting displays in the basin area. I thought it worth the visit.",
          "So pleased to beable to take in this site while in Banff. The interactive portion is marvelous. The actual cave and basin is totally worth the trip.",
          "We spent a few hours touring this facility. The interpretative centre is well done but the real fun begins as you walk along the trail, a little up the mountain, to see the origins of the Hot Springs. Well worth the visit.",
          "The history of the Canadian Parks system is beyond where your imagination could take you. Walk away with a clear understanding of the what is a worldwide unique offering of this area of Canada. A lot of fun and very informative. Enjoy.",
          "Very interesting site. The smell in the cave is different, to say the least. Great viewpoints outside.",
          "If your in Banff, this is a must see, especially if you are new to the area. The historic site is more than that, it's an amazing conservation area with some rare breed protection happening. Also visit the Remembrance Museum behind the Cave and Basin site. The board walk is",
          "This is not a very big cave or mineral pool but it has a very interesting museum with it. I felt it good to see the origins of this national park. The museum is not too big and is not far out of Banff",
          "Fascinating and entertaining tour lead by Alison showed us how Canada's first National Park came into being. Great place. Excellent value. Alison was amazing and brought it all to life in a skilful way. It was a great way to spend a morning. Thank you. Great way to end our",
          "The history of the area, and the geology of how the hot spring arises, is fascinating and well-shown with the walk into the cave. Very good explanatory boards around site.",
          "While the cave and springs themselves may not be that impressive, the museum and the trails that have been built up around it are. Really helps you understand how the discovery of the small cave with a Hot Spring lead to the foundation of Canada\u2019s national parks. We really",
          "For those of you that don\u2019t know Cave and Basin is a important historic site in Banff. Visit and enjoy. You used to be able to have a hot tub here - I was there then. You can\u2019t anymore but lots of great stuff there.",
          "Cheap sure but a waste of time. Feels like a way parks just stuck a desk inside a historical sight to make money. No one was around to assist with directions or tell stories or anything. Spend an hour there alone with 10 of us. The girl at the cash gave all the adults stamps to",
          "Can spend a lot of time exploring and hiking the many trails Loved learning the history of the area.",
          "Not overwhelmingly, but good historical location. Video was interesting to watch in main hall. Worthwhile place to stop if in Banff for first time.",
          "Tells the story of the discovery of the hot springs in Banff in 1800s and the founding of the 1st national park of Canada. Easy information, varied and interesting and a short boardwalk to the higher springs.",
          "This should be a required visit during a Banff stay. In addition to the interesting information about the basis and water, there is an outstanding slide show about nature and a wealth of related topics.",
          "Interesting place and worth the visit. The cave is small and not too impressive but the story of this area is worth learning!",
          "Canada is generally an expensive place to visit as a tourist, but this was a fabulous exception. Less than $10 for two of us, and we spent a few hours walking through the lovely boardwalk trails, through the unusual, almost estuarine, area. A great place to visit, and a nice",
          "The Parcs Canada guide did a great job explaining the geology and the history of the people in this area. The site is well laid-out, and easy to see how it became such a prominent site. The sulpher odor can be a little surprising!",
          "This is the place where the history of Banff as a tourist destination started, around the hot sulphur springs. If you can stand the smell, walk around, look at the snails, or go inside and visit the less pungent museum.",
          "A natural hot spring and interesting biodiversity that goes along with it, including the endangered snail that calls it home. Worth a visit if you\u2019re interested in learning about these thing. It\u2019s pretty cool for all ages! Parks Canada staff are very knowledgeable and able to",
          "Interesting interpretive centre, where Banff began! Be sure to look out for the snails found in the cave!",
          "This is a natural, sulphurous spring in a mountain above Banff. It initially was a sacred space for indigenous people but, of course, eventually taken over by the government. There's a pool above ground that is home to endangered snails. And, below ground, there's a cave with",
          "Really well displayed and interesting. We went at a quiet time so loved the atmosphere of the closed in, low lit pool and the evocation of early tourism in the excellent museum. And there\u2019s always the tiny endangered snails. No need to walk up the slope if you have limited",
          "You get to enter a cave that has historical relevance but it felt quite crowded since it's so small. Hard to get a good photo once you're inside. It's worth a visit but if you're planning your trip to Banff, I wouldn't add this to the top of your list. At least it's cheap!",
          "As part of a tour, our group stopped here. What a delightful experience! The Site provides both historical background about the Canadian park system and also interesting information about the hot springs and the role of snails. Allison provided an excellent explanation about",
          "Quite an interesting way to spend an hour +/- when visiting Banff. Provides some interesting history. The have self guided as well as guided tours of the facility.",
          "Very interesting place with good exhibits. If you have a Parks Canada pass then you get in free. Lovely views from high up.",
          "We arrive early and got a parking site right at the location. Great visit and very interesting. A wonderful place.",
          "Our tour group had an excellent lecture from geologist Gabrielle. I have to admit, much of it was over my head, but she is a delightful presenter and went out of her way to answer questions on a level understood by all. After the talk, she took our group into the cave (I had",
          "It\u2019s quite inexpensive to visit here, but one visit is plenty. There is only one cave (which is small) that has a thermal pool and one small thermal basin located outdoors. The air smells of sulfur but it is not overwhelming. There is an interactive hall with a few things",
          "This was part of my escorted tour. It's an interesting place in that the hot spring was the origin of Banff. It doesn't take but a few minutes to walk through the cave and see the original spring. It's humid and smelly (sulphur). There are a lot of story boards describing",
          "You can choose to pay for a guided tour of Caves and Basin or not. The area (and parking) is free to access. It gives a good history and understanding of the hot springs and how Banff came to be.",
          "Small and interesting spot, not big deal but its for free and very short visit, so it worth it, easy to find, not crowded",
          "This attraction has a sulphur spring, a small cave, and a nice nature trail along the river. The trail is especially nice for birdwatching as it traverses forest and marshland.",
          "The cave/pools are only small and so can get very crowded. In themselves they would not warrant a detour but it is the sense of the past which is so enchanting. The Banff bus goes out there which would save the drive or quite a long walk. Entry is free with the National Parks",
          "We walked from town and it took us about 20 minutes. Great place to walk around and check out the Sulphur pools, which do stink. But it was still cool and we enjoyed the cave.",
          "A lovely walk from the town, takes about 30 mins. The cave itself costs $3.90 to enter but tbh you don\u2019t need to go in. 1 it absolutely stinks, the sulphur levels are high, you can only stay in a couple of minutes. You can view most everything else from outside. The boardwalks",
          "This place is beautiful. I loved learning about the history of the first national park and feel I have a new appreciation for them and our government at the time of it being a protected place. Apart from the wonderful history lesson this place is beautiful! We only had an hour",
          "Walked to the park from town - takes about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace through a nice residential/ park area. We took a ranger tour which was informative and entertaining. The ranger relayed stories of the area and there are costumed rangers throughout the walk roleplaying",
          "Interesting museum. This is the birthplace of Canada\u2019s national parks. Learned a lot and enjoyed the exhibits, especially the cave.",
          "You see the cave within 1'. The only interesting thing is the snails that live in the hot water. Other than that, this place is quite boring.",
          "Again, it is busy this time of year and it was hard finding a parking spot but we finally did with a walk...interesting history to read along the walk to the 'Cave' and lots of interesting facts and history inside. You can actually walk to the the hot springs and see how they",
          "Great visit today to the Cave Ann Basin Historical site. $3.90 entrance fee - excellent value for money. Very interesting history, brought to life and amazing to see the sulphur springs. Roam bus route 4 takes you right there. And if you are a photographer, some fantastic",
          "Not sure if you are aware but Cave and Basin is where Canada's National Park system actually began. Inside will tell you all the history lesson you need to know about this site. It even showed you where it was once were a place where people took a dip on a real natural hot",
          "You get in free with your parks pass. It was neat to see the history of the parks. Only took about 30 minutes. The cave itself was nothing much. After being at yellowstone last year this is quite a let down as the surrounding area is not natural but ok for a quick stop. parking",
          "This was a neat stop to learn about the history of Banff and of the area. We got lucky and stopped by mid afternoon, right before a tour started. They run 2 afternoon tours - I recommend taking one. The park doesn't does an ok job of telling the story of this area, but having",
          "We'd heard good things about this place but when we arrived, we found it very confusing! With our Parks Canada discovery pass, entry was free for us which was a bonus. The cave is tiny and stinks of sulphur! Other than that, there wasn't much else there that we enjoyed. There",
          "We were in the town of Banff on s particularly rainy day, so we stopped here. There is a small fee to enter. My husband likes history, and I prefer the present. Lol! He probably would\u2019ve rated this stop s but higher than me because of this.",
          "good for the kids. a drawing room , a small movie to see. good location for in-between hikes or transfer drivers. will not take you much time unless the kids stay in the drawing room.",
          "If your looking for a cave experience it won't be spelunking. They had a very good story of the history of the pool and cave. Take the walk up the hill along the boardwalk to the pools and springs. The whites, greys and greens in the pools are quite impressive. Don't miss",
          "Cave & Basin is a nice visit if you can appreciate the nature of thermal vents & preservation of the Canadian snail. There's a strong sulphuric smell that wafts through the air. The colors of the thermal pools are amazing. Read through the signs which gives you a little history",
          "Popped in for short visit. Very reasonably priced. Adults $3.90, youths free. Exhibition/photos interesting. Cave itself not very big, as would be expected. Sulphur Smell quite overpowering! Lovely trails nearby. Plentiful free parking.",
          "This is a Parks Canada operated location. Gift shop is reasonably priced. The cave is like being in a 15x15 room w 20 people lol With a visit ... once ... Under $4.00 pp Bathrooms and built staircase hike option",
          "Cave and basin is historic due to it being Canada's first national park. Once you get over the sulfuric smell you can take in the sights of cave and basin. The basin part has a beautiful blue pool of water with the tiny snails floating in there. It might not sound like much,",
          "Mid week trip with my daughter for a getaway we were happy to stop at Cave and Basin for the history lesson. It is a beautiful center and explains the history of the site and also has another center that tells about the Internment Camps that were set up in the area during the",
          "Nicely done interpretive history exhibit! The movie screen visuals really tell the stories with impact. Worth the fee and time. We spent only about 30 minutes there but could have also had a good walk if we\u2019d had the time.",
          "Really special to see this spot... this is where the magic of Banff started! Worth a visit! PS.... you're not suppose to touch the water in the cave... save the snails!",
          "Cave and basin are worth a visit if you\u2019ve an hour or so spare. Quite cheap too which is even better, you get to see the cave and hot springs and where the old swimming pool used to be, it also has a nice boardwalk set out to see the source of the springs.",
          "We stopped here on a day we didn't have any plans. It was very cool, cheap and didn't take more than an hour or so. If you are looking for a quick stop with a lot of history and information, I would highly recommend this stop.",
          "Join the tour for an informative experience of this very notable site, though you can also have a very interesting visit on your own. The display panels are very informative. The display panels, tour and sites explain the site and area's human history and more.",
          "When I was young we used to swim at this hot spring all the time. Had to go back and see it with my daughter. Love what they have done to the interpretive center. And can't wait to see what is to come. If you can and are able take the bike on the stairs it's worth the look. .",
          "Nice walk, probably 15 minutes round trip and cheep $3.90 per adult to go into the cave. Strong sulphur smell from the water but pretty neat that it\u2019s all natural that way. You can get some really great pictures, lots of mountain views. Gift shop and two bathroom locations.",
          "Canada Parks pass gets you for free. Parents found this more interesting than the kids. Kudos to the parks Canada staff around the location with interactive tables ready to engage and talk w kids. Prep for the Sulphur smell!!",
          "We enjoyed the board walks with the various displays explaining the geological creation of the area and spring water formation. The cave was beautiful. Visiting the sulphur mountain hot springs after this site is a must. A bit of walking and stair climbing is involved as is the",
          "The cave where Banff National Park began is magical, but we were really struck by how white colonials have appropriated (and continue to appropriate) this site. There is a panel explaining the history and significance of the Cave to Indigenous folk, but the message is quickly",
          "Really enjoyed learning about the history of the site. The museum was small but interesting. My daughter (7 yo) loved the park ranger led craft activity. My son (8 yo) really enjoyed doing the junior ranger book, especially when he got to talk to one of the rangers about the",
          "The Cave basin is a wonderful place for you to spend time exploring and learning.The exhibits are interesting.There is aCave and Sulphur Pond.There are audio visual presentations.A Nice experience",
          "Make a stop here! The history is very interesting. You can spend as much or as little time as you want. It\u2019s the place that started the Banff national park system. There is a set of Canada red chairs here (look them up). Tebet also have their own explorers book for children",
          "The cave basin has a sulphur pool and a sulphur cave as well as multiple walkways around the property. A very interesting and inexpensive place to visit if you can handle the sulphur smells.",
          "less crowded than other tourist spots but very nice place to visit and learn about the early history & geology, etc. There are guided tours or you can browse the area yourself. Minimal entrance fee can be purchased at the gift shop or at the entrance.",
          "As the birthplace of Canada's national parks, we could not miss this site. A bit disappointed as there's just one very small cave (we've been to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, US) but it was interesting and there were many educational exhibits.",
          "Lovely place with such an amazing story. Everyone must come and check out this gem when in the area! It was walking distance from where we were staying, even when it was raining it was beautiful!",
          "There was a lot more there than we were expecting with a good exhibition . A good well marked trail also.",
          "I was expecting this to be bigger but what they have there is still neat. There is one cave and then some outdoor paths to see some of the other natural hot springs. You also have a good view of the valley from the top of the site.",
          "I found this very interesting for both its history in the Canada's parks system and the fascinating natural springs emanating from the mountain. It provides a good insight into the history of the sight and allows you to trace the waters back to where they exit the hillside. The",
          "Seemed like an interesting place in the brochure. Easy to get to on public transport, not far from Banff. Its very cheap to visit less than 4 dollors per adult and one of the very few places that do not charge under 17s. You wont take long to do the lot, the pools stink as they",
          "The significance of this site is reflected in the effort made to create a physical setting that tells the story of the first Canadian National Park. If you have an annual pass for your vehicle, take it with you to the office and avoid the entrance fee.",
          "It is a stinky part of Canadian history, and there might be a snail. The parks staff are knowledgeable, ask them questions, do a school project on it later, get an A.",
          "Just out of town is this historic site which is free if you have a Parks Pass so we decided to have a look. Suprising history back to the time of construction of the railway when it was a hot spring and baths, and now is basically a living museum. You start with some story",
          "a 30 minute pleasant walk from town centre to the welcome centre and a short walk up to the sites. The Cave is quite small but interesting and then the rest of the site is full of useful information on the history of Banff and other stuff like the pool with the Banff snails. The",
          "The grotto with the blue looking water was good and lit just enough, mind you head going in and out if you're tall as you have to stoop. The brief film show was short and interesting.",
          "The interpretive centre and caves are well worth the small price of admission! We explored the area outside at first, then paid admission to explore the cave and interpretive centre. Very impressive! Lots of history and information; I recommend checking it out! The staff are",
          "We visited in Mid April 2019. The visitors center was closed so we walked the premise and learned a lot from the informational boards. Really happy we saw it. The habitat living in the hot spring streams and ponds like the endangered Banff Springs Snail was amazing to see.",
          "Great little place, tucked away. I went fairly early in the day and it was nice and quiet. It was really interesting to read all the history and storyboards around the centre (something that Parcs Canada does really well!) and learn more about the history of the site and the",
          "The cave with the grotto is interesting to look at, the rest we found to be rather boring. Still a nice option for a rainy day as it has a bus stop nearby and entrance is cheap.",
          "I would highly recommend taking the time to visit this site. One has to know that it is closed on Monday and Tuesday though. The hours are limited to the other days from 11am-5pm. If it\u2019s possible to fit this into an agenda you will find a history of the area that is",
          "Great for bird watching because the birds stay around year round. The warm springs attract all kinds of wildlife. The history was really interesting and great for a rainy day. The hike is a small loop that takes you to a marsh area. The streams had snails, tadpoles, and fish.",
          "I loved visiting the Cave and Basin. The history is very interesting and both the cave and the basin are amazing! Such a special place.",
          "Our first day in Banff it was pouring so we decided to forego hiking and do some touristy stuff. Although the actual cave was a little disappointing compared to pictures online, it was really great to be able to see and experience the site. There was soooo much information to",
          "Cave and basin is known to be the birthplace of national parks. The site itself provides lots of info panel outlining its origin, park history, climate change, and the future of climate and national parks in Canada. The cave itself will smell like Sulphur (eggs) but it\u2019s not",
          "The video and photographic presentations were lacking in content and history and there was scant acknowledgement of or information about the First Peoples.",
          "Interesting history of the hot springs and the cave. The pool in the cave was very pretty but expected more. Would definitely recommend but doesn't take much time to go through the educational presentation then take a peek into the cave basin.",
          "Our guide was really good, sorry I can't remember his name, kept the tour interesting even if his acting left something be desired, nice place to visit if you have a couple of hours to spare",
          "We took a tour with Discover Banff Tours today, and Cave and Basin was one of the stops. There is a gift shop and a number of exhibits to see. You can also walk into the cave and see the original bath spring. You can also walk out and see where the pool used to be. Worth a",
          "It is located in the town of Banff, within the Canadian Rocky Mountains, at the site of natural springs. It is away from the bustle of downtown and most significant landmarks.",
          "This was just ok for me tho my husband enjoyed it. You get to see a sulphur smelling body of water within a cave and learn some history.",
          "The Cave and Basin is defiantly worth a visit but make sure you speak with the park staff there as they really helped us appreciate the history of the area more. Learnt a lot about the Banff Snails as well, they are hard to spot as they are so tiny but you can see lots of them",
          "We really enjoy learning the history of the cave & basin. Beautiful scenery. I would recommend this place.",
          "An insight into how the cave and basin used to be in days gone by. Really nice area and free if you have an explorers pass. Wow, sulphur stinks lol. Staff very knowledgeable and pleasant. A great short trip",
          "The Cave and Basin is must stop when visiting Banff for the first time. Here was where the first sulphurous hot spring was discovered and monetized. Above ground you can see gushing hot springs and ponds. We saw tiny fish swimming in the hot water but none of the endangered hot",
          "The visit provides an excellent exposure to the impact of hot springs on the ecology of the mountain climate. There are several trails including Discovery Trail or the Marsh Trail. The center was under renovation during May so we could not visit the bathhouse.",
          "This was the first National Park in Canada and is a great place to visit. There is a wonderful interpretive center/museum, you can visit the actual cave that was discovered, see the hot pool, look for snails (yes, it is a real thing!) and learn a lot while having fun. There is a",
          "This unexpected venue provides a brilliant introduction to how Canada\u2019s National Parks began at this point of discovery in the 19th C when prospectors found the mineral pools! A must visit!",

          "It\u2019s $3.90 a head, there is a lot to view & learn about. I felt it was pretty good value for the couple hours we spent wandering about the site. Staff was very friendly, especially a summer employee from Toronto who took the time to make a few small crafts with my daughter. She",

          "We loved our visit here. If you have purchased a park pass, bring it with you so admission is free. Shows the history of the area and the origin of the springs. What a beautiful monument to Canada's National Parks.",
          "The upgrading and restoration at this site is ongoing. Enjoyed the visit and displays onsite. Lots of history here.",
          "My family and I spent an hour here as it was free with our annual park pass. It\u2019s an interesting account of the beginning of the national park system and conservative. Many of the hiking trails leading out were unfortunately closed.",
          "It is not incredibly large but it is definitrly worth a visit. The cave is beautiful and they certainly have a lot of history to be known (that we all should know). Enjoyed the visit for sure.",
          "If you buy a day rover in Banff the trip up here is covered. The cave is down a long narrow passage and you can see the hole in the roof that the native Americans used to defend down on a rope. There was a good exhibition on its history and the Banff snail which is now",
          "I always like to take a tour here with anyone that hasn't seen it. It is very neat and not very expensive. Worth a quick stop in.",
          "This is a great small museum. Best for small kids and history buffs but my teenagers even had fun. This winter they have vintage winter carnival games in the courtyard in addition to the cave and the static displays including ice cube sculpture building and box hockey. Make sure",
          "Living in Alberta my whole life, I have never thought of going to the Cave and Basin. This time we finally popped in. It has a lot of great history and I could not get my head around the cave until I actually saw it. I was surprised at how they made there way down and finally",

          "We walked from the Banff Springs hotel to rhe Cave and Basin historic site. The whole walk was about 2 hours round trip back to the hotel. It was only 3 or 4 bucks each to get into the building to see the exhibits. Interesting history and science here. Recommended!",

          "It is pretty walk from the bridge just under 15 mins, the view from the top is fantastic at sunset, cave is small. The museum portion is great with awesome displays if you like walking and looking around that\u2019s your place. We were the only visitors at the time do it felt special.",
          "My husband & I visited the Cave and Basin Historic Site on a quiet Wednesday in mid November. It's an easy walk from the Banff townsite and there is also plenty of parking available. We almost had the place to ourselves and we took full advantage of this. We spent quite some",
          "Admission is less than $4 for adults (kids are free) and worth the stop. Been to Banff many times and finally stopped at the cave and basin. You can be in and out in 30 minutes. If you are looking for the Red Chairs this is one of the stops.",

          "We spent about 30 minutes here and visited the cave, cave and basin display and internment display. Make sure you go aboveboard the cave basin to see the opening from the top. The are also many trails here if you are inclined.",
          "We went here one afternoon, we got in for free with our annual park pass which was awesome. The cave and basin was a little bit underwhelming, especially because of all of the other amazing things in Banff. I think they've taken some things down because it's getting out of",
          "I am glad I visited this site. It is very inexpensive, doesn\u2019t take much time, and is the site where Banff began. The cave is pretty ( a good place for a photo) and so are the basins. I didn\u2019t enjoy the slide show in the main building, but check out the Internment Memorial in",

          "A lovey riverside walk up to the Cave and Basin site. It showed the history of the site as it was first used by the First Nation's people and then its 'discovery' by the railway workers in the early 20th century. Well worth a visit.",
          "Definitely expected more from the cave, but I enjoyed it! The museum area was great and it was a nice place to walk around.",
          "The cave is interesting and the outdoor boardwalk along the forest is very pretty, however, the indoor exhibits are not worth the time.",
          "The Cave and Basin was first discovered more than 100 years ago by explorers but had been used by the indigenous people for many centuries prior to that. There is an excellent display giving the history of the Cave and Basin, artwork, and in the long hall a huge movie screen",

          "Short drive from Banff with lot,s of parking and inexpensive admission. Lot,s of displays to read about this historical place. The warm waters must have given the early settlers healing sensations. You can walk around the patio outside the museum and take in the surrounding",
          "This is a beautiful grotto with a brilliant blue pool. It doesn't take much time to see the pool but it can get crowded quickly as the area is very small. If you want to take photos you should get there when they open at 9 as it is quite crowded in the afternoons. This site",
          "The admission to the Cave and Basin complex is very cheap, and you get some very interesting access to the cave and hot pool that started it all. The admission gets you to a great history display about the parks as well, and even a delightful little art gallery. It's hard to go",

          "Decided to check this place out and a pleasant surprise with the displays and videos explaining all about why this is a special area here in Banff. The walk around the trails and wooded fenced stairs up to the top of the viewpoints above the exhibits is really great.",

          "The cave is a small room with one bench about the size of my hotel room with a pool of sulfur water. The gift shop was bigger. The history plaques were the most interesting part but you can read about it without going there. There was an outdoor art show. Kids might enjoy the",
          "We purchased a combo pass that included the Upper Hot Springs so came back the next morning to visit this site. Word of advice, come early as the parking lot fills up quickly. Even though we checked online using Banff's \"real time\" parking site and it said there were spots",

          "This should be a must do so that you can appreciate Banff National Park. Free if you have an annual park pass and a nominal fee if you don't. Explains the finding and development of the first hot spring which eventually led to the creation of the National Park system. Does not",

          "This spot is what originally drew crowds to the area. While no longer an active spa ( there is another nearby ) the history of this location is very interesting. Not a must see but on a rainy day a great option. Very interesting walk into the \u2018cave\u2019",
          "Very nice stop at Cave and Basin. Reasonable price for some interesting Canadian geological and national history. We spent about an hour here and were very satisfied with our experience.",
          "The cave was quite small but nonetheless interesting. The whole site was well laid out with information boards explaining its history. We enjoyed it very much, then went for one of the long walks by the river. Well worth the visit.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to Cave & Basin and I'm glad we went. The displays and info boards are well done and are very informative. It was really neat to see where Banff actually started!",
          "Even on a rainy morning it was a great activity. Lots of interesting history. Was even able to do the short boardwalk In the rain.",
          "We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the parking lot was about 70% full. There was a decent amount of people there that day. So the one distinction this place has is that it's the first National Historic Site in Canada. Down at the parking lot there was a gift shop,",
          "Interesting place to visit and find out about the history of Banff National Park. It\u2019s free with your park pass and would be a shame not to visit at some point if you have an hour to spare. It\u2019s really small so you don\u2019t need to spend long here. The conservation exhibit was fun",
          "It was interesting to learn about the history of Cave and Basin Historical Site - how it was discovered and led to the creation of the Canadian national parks - but the cave itself was small and not very impressive. Still, it was worth a quick stop to gain some information about",

          "There is an opportunity to earn a junior ranger badge at this point. There is a neat museum. On our visit, they had a living history event going on too. You will learn about the original hot springs. There is a long but easy hike to waterfalls from the parking lot too",

          "My friend and I stopped here to see this. It was interesting to say the least. They say how Canada's Parks started with the discovery of this place by three men. It's just a very short walk into the cave. Was worth seeing and learning the history of this discovery.",
          "I was excited to visit what is billed as the birthplace of Canada\u2019s national park system. Unfortunately, you get, quite literally, nothing apart from the cave and basin in the name. Once I had seen the (small) cave and the (small) basin, 10 minutes had elapsed and I was left",
          "We really enjoyed our little walk through here. Definitely more of a smelly (sulphur) museum. It was interesting and informative. There is a little play area for kids, but nothing crazy. We got in free with our annual pass (bring it inside). If you don't like history, likely",

          "Cave and Basin is a great spot for young families as there is usually something for everyone to do. Is this a must do in Banff? No, but if you have a few hours to kill and want to stick close to town it is worth the effort. Make sure to bring your park pass as it gets you in",
          "Cave and Basin is the part of Banff Park that is the source of the original hot springs. The cave itself is basically a tunnel to a pool with a hole in the ceiling over it - not really that interesting. It should be noted that all the grounds around the Cave & Basin are",

          "Easy to find just below Sulphur Mountain. Great displays and continuous movie displays. Cave is just magic with lovely strong scent of Sulphur and crystal clear waters. Ponds and boardwalks are great with information boards placed everywhere. Really worth a visit.",

          "I definetly recomend seening this place at least once. It is smelly from the sulfur pools, but very interesting to see. There were a lot of information boards around that gave you a history of the place. It was worth the trip for me. There were board walks that were",
          "Went with 2 toddlers. It was a nice morning and the kids enjoyed it. It wouldn't be a huge disappointed to miss it though.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit at the Cave and Basin. It was not too crowded, the views are beautiful, and there was even some crafts for little kids.",
          "Interesting from the historical perspective, but if you are pressed for time, I would skip it. The cave isn\u2019t too impressive, but did enjoy looking for snails in the pools.",
          "I got here 80 minutes before closing but it was ample time to see it. First off it's not much of a \"cave\" so dont get your Hope's up for some dark deep cool cave, it's about 160 feet to the end, hot because it's a hot sulfur spring... and this is what I'm used to in Hot Springs",
          "Us and the kids 12, 11, 10 enjoyed this very much. We spent 2 hours learning and exploring and then hiked down to the river on the paved trail. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "This is worth spending some time exploring. It is walkable from town or you can catch a bus for $2.00. Good place to take kids, not expensive. Banff was started when explorers discovered hot springs. The Native population had used the caves as ceremonial places. The combination",
          "For the cost of entry it was okay, but it wasnt very exciting. Very limited things to do and see apart from the historic site.",
          "Avoid this place. Cave is a joke. Stinks and is not very big. We were expecting a vast cave complex but were confronted by 1 small area. Rubbish",
          "Traveled with my husband and two young children in July of 2018. The kids really enjoyed walked through the \"spooky\" cave and it was really nice to see the original hot spring that led to Banff being established as a national park. The interpretive centre had some interesting",
          "I know it's got great historical significance, but the sight itself is pretty underwhelming and not worth the price of admission. You're far better off enjoying the free delights of the neighbouring wetlands",
          "The display is very interesting and we enjoyed learning all about the area and Park's Canada. After the displays and a visit to the cave, we went for a hike along the river which was beautiful. We saw so many wonderful birds and huge colourful butterflies it was fantastic. It",
          "This is the perfect introduction to Banff so go early in your trip. Not only do you see and smell the hot springs that made Banff what it is today, you see a comprehensive and multi-sided historical view of how it got here. Plenty of activities whether your interest is in",
          "Super interesting, informative and interactive - it's well worth a visit. You can visit the source of the hot springs - be warned though, the spring in the cave STINKS of sulfur, so much so I had to leave. Guess I should have paid attention when I read that the spring was fed",
          "Although this is a cheap venue, we were quite disappointed to walk into the \"cave.\" It is only a one room, small cave. I guess we are spoiled having 2 easily accessible caves near us, so we were expecting more. The positive is that you don't have to hike to this cave. It is",
          "The museum is very well-done and is beautiful. It is really interesting to walk in the caves and see the snails. This type of snail is only found in these caves.",
          "Very interesting and informative. Well worth the visit. There were lots of mosquitoes on the trail. Bug spray would have helped.",
          "We took the (free) tour with a great guide/actress. We learned why people settled here during a nice short walk around the place. The visit was included in the Parks pass. The cave itself is very small.",
          "An interesting place to visit. Loved learning about the hot springs in the cave. The history of it and its use is amazing. Nice walk around inside and outside learning and exploring. Great staff that knows a lot and ready to share with visitors. A good video provides even more",
          "It was nice to see. We couldn't touch the water because of environmental contamination. There was a distinct smell of sulphur in the air. There was an okay museum attached and we saw some snails. We like seeing the old fashioned bathing suits.",
          "Really well presented site with knowledgeable folks around to answer questions. On the day we went there was lots of interactive stiff for all ages as well. Enjoyed the cave and baths plus the boardwalk as well A good afternoons visit",

          "seems like a must do in Banff , but nothing would have happened had i missed it many people there but no guidance of how to see it and were to go",
          "This was a great little side trip offering a way out of a brief shower. The Cave holds the hot spring from which sprang the national park. There is a little museum to contextualize the spring to be followed by a short walk through a tunnel to the sulphur-emiting pool. Well",
          "My husband and I are in Banff for a weekend getaway and wanted to check out a site that wasn't a crazy hike. Cave and Basin Historic Site is a great easy stop. Lots of trails around too if you are up for it but the site itself is great. The additional museum about the WWI",
          "The cave and basin is pretty cool to be able to walk through the man made tunnel to the site. The cave was discovered I believe by railroad workers working on the Canadian RR years and years ago. They saw steam coming from the Mt and went in to discover it. When you are in the",

          "Definitely something I could have skipped. Not much to see and there are way better options if you're looking for pretty views and things to do.",
          "A well designed and very informative presentation of this Cave and Basin (mineral springs). The video Hall was amazing. A guided tour outside completed our visit.",
          "We were disappointed in this attraction. We didn't have to pay a lot to enter, but after touring the attraction we felt we paid too much. There is a cool hot spring with some beautiful colors; however, if you have ever been to Yellowstone then you have seen the same thing",
          "Well worth the visit!! The views, the sights\u2014just wow! We typically avoid heavy touristy spots like this, but I am so glad we did this. You can see the cave, the basin, sulphur pools, hike around, wander a marsh!",
          "Well set out with good information boards on trail and in the exhibit area. Looked like it was being updated though so maybe a work in progress. Not expensive and worth a visit",
          "If you have a Canadian National Park pass you get in for free. If not I think it\u2019s close to $4 per person. You go into the gift shop to show your pass or purchase tickets and they stamp your hand. You walk a short way to \u201cthe cave\u201d. Yes there is a sulfur smell but it\u2019s not as",
          "Hiked here from town and enjoyed the information about the finding of the sulfur springs. Cannot take the waters here but there is bathing close by.",
          "We got in for free on Canada Day otherwise, it has a small fee to get in. It had a small cave with a small hot spring and a larger hot spring outside. We looked around at different boards of information. They had 3 large screens playing videos but we didn't stick around to watch",
          "Good place to visit and offered a lot more than we could explore, most areas were accessible however the hikes were not as I am disabled. The cave and basin along with the displays were fully accessible and enjoyable.",
          "It is different and cheap. If it cost any more, I would say don't bother. The cave is cool, it reeks of sulfur as one would expect. The history is fun to read about. I wouldn't make this your top priority, but a good break in the day if you need somethng to fill time. I don't",
          "This was a nice attraction to experience just once. We paid $3.90/adult and it was a good way pass the hour and learn a bit of history about Banff. The cave is quite small and easy to walk through and we got some good pictures. They warn you about the sulfuric smell before",
          "The Cave and basin is interesting as a historical site: the birth place of the worlds national parks system. But as far as how long it will take, the trip will actually be pretty quick. there is a small museum, the actual cave is pretty small, but nice to see, and the basin",
          "There was one small hot spring inside a cave and one hot spring outside. The best part was the four big screens of videos.",
          "Paved trail in and out of meadow, mountain vies, river, marsh areas. Wonder wildflowers all along path. About 3 miles trail becomes dirt. Keep going for a beautiful cascade falls area.",
          "It is definitely neat to check out and at least see it once. There was not tons of things to see but the cave is pretty cool. I would definitely recommend to see it but I wouldn\u2019t need to see it again.",
          "Cave and Basin National Historic site in Alberta's Banff National Park requires a day pass to enjoy and it is worth the price to visit the area culminating in a natural hot springs.",
          "We took the tour with Leah and are so pleased that we did! Leah took us on a journey from thousands of years ago right up till the brothers discovered the hot springs! Fantastic narrated tour with opportunities to ask questions. Thank you Leah, I now feel like I have a great",
          "We came to look for birds and animals. Not much luck for either. We had some rain and it was late in the day, prime time for the animals. Boardwalk is well maintained. Walked past the \"mineral hot springs\" and that was interesting. With more time we would have gone inside.",
          "Where it all started! Find out about the birth of tourism in Banff; the start of the National Parks; see the hot spring that has a history way before the earliest tourists... ...and not forgetting the Marsh Loop Walk and the Marsh Boardwalk...lovely open riverside & marsh/pools",
          "This place is full of interesting history and worth seeing. It is just a short drive outside of Banff. Like most caves or hot springs there is going to be some smell. But take the tour and enjoy the beauty.",
          "We visited this site and the Visitors Center but we didn't take the tour. We did climb to the roof and admired the view over the valley. However, apart from the views there didn't seem to be very much here. Apparently it tells the story of the National Parks which was a little",
          "Based on the other reviews, I was expecting the smell to be much worse. It wasn't too bad though, just smelled like boiled eggs. The exhibits were interesting, it was nice to learn some of the area history. Don't expect to be able to spot the snails though - they're really small.",
          "Lovely Walk to the cave from Banff town centre but you can also catch a bus. Interesting to see the hot spring although e smell of sulphur is strong.",
          "Cheap entrance fee..excellent guided tour ..45 mins with guides play acting a variety of roles..good films show and cave spectacular. Best visit so far",
          "Among all scenic places is Banff you should stay away of this place and enjoy your time on the lakes. Worthless !",
          "A fascinating and pretty site to see (if a little smelly!) but we really didn\u2019t learn much as most of the information is in texts dotted about - there was too much written down when it\u2019d be easier to listen. Worth a visit though!",
          "You can find the site in Banff itself so we chose it as a small stop on the way to Lake Louise. The cave was slightly ''smaller'' experience than expected but I liked it. The cave itself is very small and it is terrible but interesting how the sulfur smells very bad. There was a",
          "This stop was pretty disappointing. But I guess Ive been spoiled by places like Penns Cave in the states. The cave section is very small and nothing much to see. Rest of the complex has some interesting history, but not much so would be a short visit.",
          "Walked up to this attraction from Banff town but most arrive by car or bus - ample parking. Plenty of information about the history of the cave and basin. The view of the cave and basin itself is quite cramped but visitors tend not to linger because the sulphurous smells are",
          "Really beautiful to either go on a self guided tour or take advantage of the twice a day free tours offered by the parks Canada staff. The tour has re-enactments and is interactive at some points but lots of fun. The staff are young but clearly well trained and knowledgeable",
          "We went on a wet day but none the less it was very interesting with the information plaques giving a lot of information and history. Loads of different 'bits' to see, we stayed a while and enjoyed out time there.",
          "We stopped here on our \"Banff Town Day\". The cave was fun for a few minutes (albeit stinky) and the basin had some endangered snails. I wouldn't call this the highlight of the trip, but nice.",
          "We had family visiting and did the must see Banff obligatory visit. This time we checked out the Cave and Basin. I'm sure if you are a history buff,you might find it interesting but for us it wasn't our thing. Its a cave built into a museum. While I can appreciate what they are",
          "Make sure you use your annual Parks Pass for free entry to the cave and sulphur pool interpretive centre.",
          "We found the springs and the cave to be well worth a visit. The site also covers a lot of interesting history. Parks BC staff were friendly and informative. We also enjoyed the walk by the Bow River. Best of all the selfie stick crowed haven't discovered this place. Free",
          "So many negative reviews of this place made me slightly wary of going but we did and are so pleased we did. It is cheap to get in and interesting being the reason Banff is located where it is. There is a lovely boardwalk up the hill alongside the hot stream. Be sure not to miss",
          "This was more impressive than I thought it would be. More than just a few holes in the ground. Great history. Be sure to visit the Internment exhibit down the way. Sobering reminder of arbitrary segregation in times of war.",
          "The Cave and Basin museum is a moderate walk out from the centre of Banff, but is also well serviced by the local \u2018Roam\u2019 buses, taxis, or a car if you have one to park. At C$3.90 per adult, it provides an excellent introduction to the importance of the cave to the indigenous",
          "The cave and basin is a very interesting and historic site. Quite amazing to see. If you are sensitive to smell it can be off putting - be a mouth breather for the visit - but it is certainly a must see and quite beautiful and intriguing.",
          "A great history lesson as WWI internment camp for enemy aliens and Prime Minister Borden on the $100 bill was instrumental in removing rights that would seem unconscionable today. The National Park is a beautiful setting, but I can't wonder how much of it was built or developed",
          "Few people appreciate that thousands of so-called \"enemy aliens\" were used to build much of the infrastructure of Banff National Park (and other national parks in Canada, like Jasper). This all happened during Canada's first national internment operations when thousands of",
          "Cave and basin is about 30 minutes of interesting .... if you read all the plaques. Less if you just want to see the cave. HOWEVER...There is an extensive paved trail that leads from the parking lot that is fabulous with great views. We hiked it but next time will take bikes.",
          "We decided to make this a last minute stop...sure glad we did. We really didn't have any expectations but were pleasently surprised with how interesting the site was. You can visit the entire site in an hour and its one 5 min from downtown Banff.",
          "The hot springs though not active is a site to tell how very long ago it was used for its thermal properties and how the national park was born.",
          "A quick, cheap, visit that is worth your time. The history of the Parks is interesting (although quite dark), and taking in the sites of the cave and basin is like no other. This visit will only take about 45-60 minutes depending on how much you read/watch of the museum.",
          "We drove to Banff on a weekend as we didn\u2019t have much else to do. But this turned out to be a great time at the cave and basin. Beautiful cave (smelled a lot like sulphur) and the pond outside was also very beautiful. We went all the way upstairs too for a scenic view from the",
          "very picturesque walk but we were disappointed that it was not open on Tuesdays so could not go into caves.",
          "My curiosity was peaked with a friend suggested we check out this UNESCO world heritage site. It seems like there is a reason I hadn't been in the 27 years of my having lived nearby... Cave and Basin is a completely underwhelming experience. The basic story is that some wealthy",
          "How many visitors to Banff National Park know that much of this national park's infrastructure (roads, bridges, Buffalo Paddocks, railway beds and clearings) were built by forced labourers, so-called \"enemy aliens\" who were rounded up during Canada's first national internment",
          "We heard so much about this place and it was a total let down. It\u2019s got some great history about the springs but very little to show. We had a much better time hiking Tunnel Mountain.",
          "I hit up this cave and basin place in Banff. I didn\u2019t know anythings about this place, so I was wondering what all the hype was about. One thing you might notice with your nose is this place is kind of stanky. It smell like that sulphur smell. The tour guide from Parks",
          "...But you probably don't need to go more than once. There are good signs and educational features to help learn about where Canadas national parks began. I would suggest this is a good attraction for young families and school groups.",
          "We had a lovely guided tour and visit the great exhibition on the early history of Banff It is a little cold in the February with the snow !",
          "Can never go wrong with a Parks Canada site. This site tells the fascinating history of Banff and you can see the original hot spring cave. The pool must have been an amazing place im its time. During this visit they had curling rink set up. The day we went it was super quiet",
          "My daughter found this place when looking through various guidebooks and as it was a whiteout day we thought it would be a good place to visit. We weren\u2019t disappointed. Really interesting visitor centre with great history storyboards. The cave and springs are fascinating but of",
          "This was an interesting and worthwhile stop if you have some time to explore. The cave was pretty cool and the kids loved it although it was \"stinky\" from sulphur. They had some outdoor winter-ish activities like curling, beanbag toss, pretend fishing, show sculptures etc.",
          "Great place to go to learn the history of the parks and see the history. if you have a national park pass take it in you receive complimentary admission.",
          "This as mostly an educational place. But its still a very interesting place to visit non the less. When you go in the cave to see the pool, its has a nice atmosphere to it. The visitor centre has lots of very informative exhibits about the cave and basin as well as some about",
          "Must see Historic site! It\u2019s only a short walk from Banff downtown district along bow river. It\u2019s very educational and you get to walk into the cave and see the natural Hot Springs, make sure you do the walking tracks outside that lead up the mountain it it\u2019s a short walk with",
          "If you want attentive staff, varied activities (that are interactive!), a beautiful cave, sulphur pools, information on the first national park/ banff national park, and gorgeous hiking trails, then you MUST visit Cave and Basin. $3.90 entry each for adults absolutely worth it!",
          "It is an educational and historial stop while visiting Banff. It was free with the park pass. Strong smell of sulphur at the hot spring",
          "What an interesting experience, seeing the birthplace of Canadian national parks! The trail outside along the boardwalk is great, so many different species of plants and fish. The inner cave is a great time too - look out for snails!",
          "If you are into historical tourism then this is definetly a pit stop. It's a 20 minute walk from downtown with beautiful view of the mountains and lovely trails... If you are lucky you might see a sleigh ride go by. The museum's entrance fee is $4 and the receptionist was very",
          "This place is worth a visit whenever you are in Banff. It is I believe $4 per adult to enter. We have been yesterday and they had been a lot of activities going on there.",
          "We were looking for something to do as we had an hour to kill before leaving Banff. I was really happy we went as you get a little glimpse into the past which was really neat. The cave itself is worth the visit for only a $3.00 entrance fee or free with your discovery parks",
          "We walked here from our motel as it is only about 20 minutes or 30 at the most depending where you start from. Lovely walk along the path and through the trees. This was a free activity because of Canada 150 years. There were two beautiful pools- one in a cave that were used",
          "We had never been to this site before, which is crazy as we buy an annual national parks pass so admission is free here with that pass. It was so incredible to explore this site, to see the tiny snails that are only found here in all the planet, to try the activities that they",
          "It was a great visit, the museum is small but informative. The cave itself is a bit small and claustrophobic. If you don't mind the smell of sulfur it is cool. The cave is a great place to remember where the whole national parks system came from. Remember to bring your park",
          "We included the Cave & Basin National Historic Site as part of an all-day bicycle tour that started/ended on Tunnel Mountain Drive and also included the Banff Visitor Centre, CPR Station, Fenland Trail, Vermillion Drive/Lakes, a short stretch of the Rocky Mountain Legacy Trail",
          "While the entry fee is only low (under $4 from memory), there wasn't a lot to keep you occupied. There was some detail of the history of national parks and the original sulphur hot springs were able to be viewed. It's a little way out of town (I walked).",
          "During a stay in Banff from Scotland to ski we decided to visit the Cave and Basin. Despite previous visits to the area we had not visited this natural spectacle previously and were certainly not disappointed. The staff were very friendly and informative. The displays were very",
          "This place is mostly for educational purposes. There is a cave where you can see, but mostly it is the birthplace of Canada national parks.",
          "Went to this site on my own. It is extremely beautiful and full of history. It is amazing the resilience of the people in the 1800's. Walked the outside upper decks which offer panoramic and stunning views of the surrounding mountains. It was a winter wonderland and very",
          "This isn't a place that'll take a long time to visit even if you take it slow, but it's still well worth seeing. The information about the discovery and development of the hot spring is very well presented and the cave containing the spring itself is quite a sight (watch your",
          "Stopping here was kind of an after-thought. It's winter, so I wasn't sure what to expect to be able to do in Banff (other than skiing and snowshoeing). After checking out the downtown area, the Fairmont Hot Springs Hotel and making a reservation for the gondola, I saw the sign",
          "Loved this place. Wasn't sure what to expect but was so impressed with the history and set up. Yes it does have a very strong sulphur aroma but the cave is spectacular. We did the 'dome' show which was quite the experience. I am claustrophic but it was absolutely fine and Alison",
          "The clouds abated and the sun made us very hot as we walked through town and over the Bow River to the Cave and Basin on Sulphur Mountain, the origin of the National Parks of Canada. The walk took much longer than the 10 minutes we were told! The park includes a large historic",
          "The site deserves a lot better thab this Canada. However really liked the marsh loop walk. The highlight of the visitor centre though was playing curling rather than learning more about what should have been a lot more informative history lesson.",
          "A must visit in Banff to get to know the history of the area. The cave is small and very pungent - sulphur (rotten eggs) but very interesting in relation to wildlife and microbes.",
          "One of the main points of interest in Banff town -- an educational museum about how the springs were founded as well as the history of the pools and the building of the railroad. It's also considered the birthplace of Canada's National Parks. Unfortunately, we somehow did the",
          "Beautiful Cave and Basin, we visited in Canada's 150 year so gained free entry which was great. The cave and basin was beautiful, there was some nice history and information displayed nearby",
          "Loads of parking although just a short walk from the town center. Plenty of interesting displays and the staff were very helpful. Cave stinks to high heaven but is worth going to look at.",
          "I visited this way back in 1969 and returned again this year. The memories it awoke were fantastic. Its truly a magical place to explore.",
          "When in the area definitely check out the cave and spring. No cost. You choose your pace. The upper decks offer beautiful vistas of the surrounding area. Wanted to touch the water so bad but all signs say not too!",
          "While I appreciate the miracles and wonders that our good earth provides, this was somewhat anticlimactic. If you've never experienced natural/geothermal springs then it's worth the very brief visit required. Watch your head, the ceiling is low.",
          "The Cave & Basin is amazing! The cave is beautiful, and the basin has gorgeous views. There are exhibits and films inside. The trail is closed in winter.",
          "Nice museum and it is free! Plan to spend a few hours there and explore the cave and natural hot springs.",
          "We showed up at the end of the day and the staff were incredibly polite and informative, taking extra time to share some knowledge and answer questions, a great visit.",
          "The cave and basin has been apart of Banff forever. If you are a visitor to Canada it is a must see. It is a great family place and the kids will love it.",
          "Stopped here one afternoon, not really sure what was there but was well worth the stop. This was the original location where the sulpher springs were and they have many pictures of what it looked like back in the day. Looked like it was very beautiful. You can go down into",
          "Having walked several miles through snow we came across this attraction. It was free to enter and showed the thermal pools that once attracted visitors to early Banff. Also has a cafe.",
          "We always try to visit the cave and basin when we're in Banff as it's got so much to see and learn about it's history as well as other parks in Canada. It's free with your park pass. Staff are friendly and helpful if you have questions. The send a postcard exhibit is fun.",
          "Visited the Cave and Basin National Historic Site and undertook the free walking tour with our guide Rina. Rina's knowledge of this location was great. It is a great place to hear about the very first National Park in Canada and how it impacted on the lives of those who",
          "We were having a day off from skiing so decided to have a walk through Banff to here to spend a couple of hours. The boys enjoyed the cave and got to have a try at curling and the ice slide. We found the cost reasonable and we are glad we visited.",
          "Really enjoyed this spot in the mountain. The cave was unique and all the history pictures and stories to read and see was very interesting, did not know how unique Canada actually is and was.",
          "I think its a must to see the cave and basin site when you visit Banff for the first time. You can easily spend a half hour to hour in there. Very interesting to see how the caves got discovered and also how they are trying to preserve the natural habitat.",
          "This place has a cave with a hot spring inside. There is an attached visitor center with a ton of information. Worth the stop.",
          "There is a lot of information packed into the building and surrounding site. You can actually go into the cave , which is what the pictures are, where a Banff employee will give u information. There are exhibits and an outdoor walking area to do as well. Very nice",
          "Nice to go back in the past and see pictures of the cave and basin in the beginning and learn about the history. Area smells of sulphur but is not too bad.",
          "We found the whole site very interesting. It is not just about the actual cave but everything else on site. We spent ages reading all the fact boards and watching the video presentation which we found very emotional. You can dip your hand in a trough of water outside the centre",
          "My husband and I didn't expect to spend too much time as many reviews indicated it didn't take long to go through. Yes if you just to the 'indoor' cave, it's a short visit (and would be very crowded in summer I'm sure - we went in late September). But you must take the time to",
          "As we were early we could experience the cave by ourselves. Do not expect a whole cave system, it is only one cave, but a beautiful one. Further exhibition explains about the cave and its use for the inhabitants. Videopresentation is beautifully made and interesting.",
          "This cave is the reason for Banff's existence. It is small but atmospheric, the original cave where three railway workers on their day off in the 1880s found the hot (and sulphur smelling) springs which first led tourists to the area. The actual cave won't detain you for more",
          "Free with Canada NP Pass 2017. Don't expect to go into a large cave, but the informational displays tell you a lot about the history of the area. They also have a live display of history outside on patio. I am glad we visited! Good for children also.. There were older school",
          "Was fun to go and walk around with our young twins. We got there around 9 to kill time before the rest of town opened. Staff was really nice and fantastic. The exhibits were well done, informative, and fun.",
          "It was a fun way to learn about some history unique to Banff and the park development in Canada. The cave itself is small, but it's tranquil and pretty. The observation decks above the museum are great too. It was a nice activity that you can fit easily into a day in Banff.",
          "This sight is interesting. You can go into the cave where the water comes out of the ground. Additionally you get some information about the hot springs but that is about it. Fortunately you don't need to pay for 2017. Otherwise I would say it's not worth it.",
          "Very interesting visit. The guided visit is really a must. This is free in 2017 for Canada 150th Birthday.",
          "Everything about Banff has me wondering what it was really like Nearly 150 years ago. I love visiting the Cave and Basin, I just wish the visitor center was larger, and had more exhibits. The price reflects that though, and you are getting a really good deal.",
          "The 2017 display is very interesting and interactive. The cave and basin park provides peaceful walks.",
          "There was a film on how thw hot water spring was discovered and a history of the railway being built. In the 1880's the British decided to push the railway through right across the country from the east to Vancouver, to unite the country and to stop the Americans stealing the",
          "I really enjoyed this stop on our trip around Banff. The cave itself is super cool, but the trek up the boardwalk was less impressive. The pictures I saw on the website are misleading as this area is not very big, but it is beautiful. It's definitely worth making a stop and",
          "My son and I walked up through the snow to see this attraction. It was very interesting. Unfortunately on the day we went the views were rather obscured by mist but we walked along the trail. The cave was small and dark and , as others have said, the smell is quite strong. we",
          "Very good museum, you get some historic information on the founders and use of the cave. You can see the cave, but heads up, it will smell like old eggs! So if you can\u2019t take the smell, this will not be a pleasant experience. Other than that, nice to see and even the little",
          "The site has a good history and story attached to it. The cave is where the national parks began, but does have a strong smell of sulphur and would recommend not going into the cave if you get nauseated quickly.",
          "This was a cool place to see, but since the cave is so small it got crowded so fast. A bus group came in shortly after us and there wasn\u2019t enough space for everyone. I\u2019m still glad we went though, it was a good place to kill an hour.",
          "This is an important site in the area but you will probably not need to spend too much time here (an hours or so). It's worth walking up towards the source of the water too; this is not too well sign posted but easy enough to find. It's all free too.",
          "Neat little cave to check out. It's dark in the cave to take pictures but you can take photos of the outside area one it's better. The view of the mountains here is spectacular it's a must. There is trails around to check out which had a bear sighting.",
          "Small museum but definitely helped to take a look back in time and appreciate the hot springs and Canadian National Parks. Viewing of original cave/hot springs was simple but interesting. Explained the history and development of National Parks since the railroad etc. We browsed",
          "This museum is free so apart from the cave containing the hot springs you should not expect too much when you visit, there are additional exhibitions and exhibits to look at but we thought they were lacking in both content and information. While we were there we also did the",
          "Follow Cave Avenue west through the forest to the birthplace of Canada's national park system, Cave and Basin National Historic Site. Here, two hot springs bubble to the surface - one inside a cave, the other nestled against the hillside - both within a restored 1914 native",
          "They have an outside area where you can dip your hand in the water that nature has warmed from inside the earth, and that was cool to experience for us since we don't have anything like that where we live. Then you go in a cave where the spring emerges (can't touch that), and",
          "My partner and I were so looking forward to the evening lantern tour offered here during our summer vacation and during the celebration of Canada 150 no less. We were expecting a Parks Canada tour guide to lead us on an educational and informative tour of the site and discovery",
          "cave and mining display very interesting.Good place to walk for all abilities. We walked to a waterfall and back ....about two hours. We spotted a large male elk close to our path we were about to turn back to avoid him when a group on horseback arrived and advised us to follow",
          "The Cave was nice to see thought it was going to be bigger and more stuff to see. I am glad that it was free admission as I would have be disappointed to have to pay for a family of 5. The visitor center was nice but the whole site could be done in 30-45mins tops. You can get",
          "Within walking distance of Centre. Sulphur certainly clears the nasal passages. Informative staff and FREE.",
          "A great place to stop and learn a bit about Banff history and Canada's national parks. The nature trail was also a pleasant walk along the Bow River. The views were amazing from this site. The cave itself was anti-climatic to the outdoor view, but nonetheless an interesting",
          "This site is interesting but small. I don't really know what I was expecting, but I was somewhat disappointed.",
          "Great place for a short walk - easy and on the flat if you need it. Very picturesque. Free parking. Good visitor centre, shop etc",
          "ells of the Canadian Park System with a visit to the cave, historical re enactments and walking trails. New facility.",
          "We had been up on the gondola and were discussing where to visit next when we saw the signs for the Cave and the Basin so decided to stop in. Wow...it was perfect. A delightful mix of interesting history combined with a nature trail. The Cave is small but still interesting",
          "We stopped here after doing the marsh trail. The building itself is historic and very interesting. The information and history of the cave are fascinating, and the cave itself is amazing. This place is worth a visit.",
          "I really enjoyed learning about the history of Canada's National Park System. There are a lot of interactive displays that are fun and interesting. The cave itself is not that interesting. It is small and most of the features were removed before it became a national site. The",
          "This is a great place to learn about the history of national parks in Canada. Both the cave and basin are interesting (even if the sulphur smell is strong!). We spent an hour here",
          "We were driving by and decided to stop. We were pleasantly surprised how interesting and informative this place is. We spent over an hour there and so glad we stopped",
          "A wonderful location to learn about the history of the national parks. Our family particularly enjoyed going into the cave as well as the boardwalk above the centre. Don't miss out on the special exhibit Enemy Aliens, Prisoners of War: Canada\u2019s First World War Internment",
          "We were delightfully surprised at how much there was to see at this site. If you got the 150 Years Free Parks Pass, there is no charge. This was the beginning of Canada's National Parks. The first thing you should do is walk through the tunnel to the hot springs and see the",
          "The history exhibits at Cave and Basin explain how the hot springs (the Cave and Basin) attracted tourists to the Banff area. The trails around the hot springs were well constructed, leading up the hill to a series of trickling springs and also a place where there was a replica",
          "We visited here two days ago because it was rainy and cold out. The woman at the front desk was very helpful and knowledgeable about the history of the park. The museum is really interesting---lots of things to read and look at. We learned a lot about the history of the park.",
          "You can no longer swim in the pools but it has become a history museum of the area. A visit to the cave and the museum area is a worth while way to get in a little background to the beginnings of the park",
          "you can almost walk to this area or if too tired take the local buses that run regularly,not a lot to see but you can visit the information centre and get further details and you will always remember the smell.",
          "We reluctantly visited here as and alternative to doing a hike as it was rainy and cold out. However, we actually found it really informative and interesting. We learned a little about the science behind the cave and basin, and also read about the history of banff (in relation",

          "We went to visit this place, spent like 15-20 min, didn't really enjoy the place. It's worth it only if it's free. Small place, not too much to see",
          "We visit Banff fairly frequently, and often bypass the Cave & Basin, as we've seen it a few times before. However, this time we decided to go, after discovering that the Gondola is now $62 a person to go up, and that gave us some time to kill, choosing not to spend that kind of",
          "Took the bus out to site & got there in time for a tour. Very interesting site & lots to see. Also an internment museum on site.",
          "This is where the Canadian national park system started. You can walk into the old cave and see the hot springs but you cannot touch them. There are also many other exhibits around the building. There is a separate building for an exhibit about Canadian internment camps during",

          "We weren't expecting much, but ended up really enjoying our visit to this NHS. The cave and snails were cool, and the staff were incredible.",
          "The Canadian government denied the 3 white men who discovered the hot springs a permit to develop a health spa and turned it into the first National Park. The museum shows the early history of the site and Banff and there are some easy scenic walks, horse riding and canoeing",
          "taking advantage of the Canada 150 free pass while in Banff, this is a must see. Beautiful scenery and it has been newly renovated since our last visit some 19 years ago. The inside Cave is gorgeous. The scenery around the marsh loop trail is an easy walk and very scenic if you",
          "The cave is super interesting to experience. Even those who are clausterphobic can manage this attraction. The rest of the facilities are a little cheesy but the staff are super friendly.",
          "A delightful place, informative staff & exhibits, cave is small but nice to see though pungent smell of sulfur. Ample parking space, restrooms, & informative signs along the way. The whole tour took us less than an hour. Overall, it was a let down but can't complain - it was",
          "With the Canada 150 free admission, we were able to drop in and take a wander around the park. We entered the cave which was smaller than I expected but was beautiful in itself. The basin was sticky - like rotten eggs but has to be experienced as well. The small snails that are",
          "We walked here from town,lovely walk. The cave is small but nice to see, it does smell of Sulphur. He exhibits are great and the staff in customs are very informative. There was a quartet singing whilst we made our visit, this was lovely to listen to. The cafe is small but at",

          "Returned after 7 years, newly renovated, and didn't get the tour this time. Tour made it a lot more interesting and would highly recommend calling ahead to know the times for the tours. A must see for the history but can skip it the next time to Banff.",
          "We had to come here to see the place where the whole Canadian national park system began, all because of the two natural hot springs at the edge of Banff's downtown. There's are good descriptions inside the 1914 stone bathhouse about the history of this area. Just outside the",
          "We planned on spending about 20 minutes here, but ended up leaving three hours or so later! Although there is an interesting display of information about the discovery of the hot springs (the reason for the foundation of Banff town), a much more fun way of learning about this",
          "The cave experience is only a small cavern that has a very strong and pungent sulfur smell. While the staff working here was very nice and hospitable, it wasn't really worth the walk.",
          "I love this Cave and Basin. I consider a \"must see\" if you are visiting Banff. It reminds me a bit of going to a ctenotes in Mexico (except you can't swim in it!)",
          "This had a nice easy trail from the interpretive centre leading up to the top of the hot spring. Th interpretive centre is built over-top the amazing underground spring that you can walk up to and take a photo (its pretty dark, so your settings will need to be just right).",
          "This is a national historic site so a top level presentation is expected and delivered. The site is well laid out and the history and geology lessons which are wrapped up in the site are well explained, engaging and just enough that you won't get bored.",
          "I've been to Banff and through this area many, many times in my life and had no idea this place existed. It was such a pleasant surprise!! It's free to get in, and gives so much history about this area and the parks across Canada. There's interactive displays and a short movie",
          "We spent a week in Banff and Jasper and found the parks to be absolutely amazing. However, the one thing they lack compared to US national parks is rangers and educational visitor centers! This is an absolute exception to the rule. This site was beautifully designed to be",
          "Not a place where you need to spend a lot of time, but is worth a stop if you're in Banff. It's interesting to learn the history behind how and where the national park started. The hot springs are a beautiful blue-green color. The tourist-friendly part of the cave is small but",
          "We took our kids here (14, 12, and 9) and we all learned some important Canadian history. I loved not only the information about the hot springs but also about the national park system in Canada. Afterward, we took the short hiking trail and learned about the animals and habitat",
          "First thing I noticed about this place is that it has a nice view of the mountains. There's several hiking trails to take but at some portions the smell of sulfur does get really strong. If strong smells aren't your thing then you may want this to be a quick stop and go hiking",
          "We had a wonderful afternoon of family fun at Cave and Basin. Plenty of free parking. Lots of trails to choose from including accessible and shorter ones for families with young kids. The indoor centre is full of great historical and area information. And the guided tour was",

          "This was our \"rainy day\" activity, and fit the bill pretty well. I actually learned a fair bit about the founding of the national park, which was nice. It also serves as a starting point for a pleasant walk along the river.",
          "We walked from Banff town centre in about 20 minutes. If driving, it has the largest free parking capacity in Banff. The cave is very interesting and from the pictures I saw before going left me thinking it was a large cavernous place. There is one short tunnel leading to one",
          "A great cave to see and is near to many other attractions without long walks such as Cascade gardens, museum, park. Enjoy!",
          "We decided to hike/walk out to this attraction one day when we were getting overwhelmed with the Banff Ave crowds and found the site to be very interesting. The center does a great job of giving you a historical perspective on the beginnings of the park. I do recommend the",
          "Wonderful National Histoic Site with interesting exhibits for people of all ages. A great way to learn about the origins of Banff.",
          "Much more to see here than we thought, for adults and kids alike. Amazing snapshot highlighting the history of Banff.",
          "Interesting place. Fascinating history. Only one hour necessary. This year free. Not much to see; Interesting info available;",
          "Strives to educate and highlight the mineral water cave but somehow the messages gets lost or meanders due to lack of substance. By all means visit the cave where you can see the 20 ft diameter pool and smell the H2S gases but what else do you have to get excited about. The hall",

          "Cave and Badin called the snail cave for sure is worth seeing . It is a little place but very interesting . It is made and design to be easy access for all kinds of tourist , older people , strollers or small kids . It does not take to long of your time to check it out and you",
          "This is a beautifully maintained historical site. The cave and basin are both beautiful and unique. I would highly recommend getting there early. I can imagine the cave can get fairly crowded. We got there around 10am and it was not crowded at all. The museum portion had a great",
          "Not a must do but very interesting. This is spot that lead to the creation of Banff National Park. We enjoyed the exhibits-they currently have A special interactive one on the coming of the railroad to the park. Enjoyed the boardwalk through the swamp. We took the horse ride",
          "walked here from the Caribou Lodge, but it was a bit of a jaunt, buy the beauty of Banff plenty is you can walk to do many places. The Roam transit will also take you there. Great history information, lots of nice hikes. Give your self some time, it's a neat little piece of",
          "We learned so much visiting Cave and Basin National Historic Site. It was interactive and fun. We also walked the Marsh Loop which was the perfect walk for the kids-- flat, paved and not too long. A great day with the kids",
          "I can just imagine what it was like for the three railroad workers who discovered this smelly basin, way back in 1883. What I can't imagine is saying 'Let's bathe in this clean, sulphur smelling water'. The water is crystal clear, but smells awful. Every now and then I got a",
          "I'm old enough to remember swimming in the pool eons ago. We visited recently with out of town friends and were pleasantly surprised with the set up and contents. The access to the cave is nicely done and you can just imagine what it looked like many years ago when indigenous",
          "Except for the strong sulphur smell, this was an interesting and fun stop! Neat to learn about the beginnings of Banff national park and the history came alive in the movie. One could spend 30 minutes or 3 hours here and feel like it was worth it, it depends on your level of",
          "Great place to visit with or without children. Interesting and historical depicting origin of Canadian national park system. There are displays with staff in period dress to answer questions, and hot springs you can walk up to. Very nice posters and education boards inside",
          "Interesting history, information about sulphur springs/mountain. Activities for kids. Staff enthusiastic.",
          "Very nice views and there is a walk you can to up top and also one you can to below called the marshloop. very nice to do both. You can also see the original springs.",
          "Easy walking...good for strollers or wheelchair accessible. Lots of interesting history if you take the time to read all the placards.",
          "We took the tour and had a excellent guide who pointed out many things along the way and shared stories of the history and the area.",
          "There are some interesting costumed \"interpreters\" near the basin who are ready to talk to you of the early history of Banff and of this hot springs cave that was such a draw to the area. Hotels were assisted by railway lines to develop the area and create a 19th century",
          "We felt obligated to visit the site while staying in Banff because of it's historic significance. If you've visited Yellowstone you'll probably feel a little underwhelmed but that shouldn't detract from the huge effort that has gone into building & maintaining this site. The",
          "neat to see the cave and the thermals and there appeared to be a lot of activities especially for kids. Just not what I was looking for",
          "This is really a small historical museum and set of exhibits -- there is a cave, and a basin, but if you're looking primarily for natural wonders you might be disappointed. However, if you want to learn about the settlement of Banff and the early days of the town and the",
          "The cave which is promoted as the main attraction was a little disappointing but the other displays and exhibitions including the history of the railway and the life of the Banff snail (much endangered) were very interesting. The staff many in period costume were very helpful",
          "We waited until our last day to visit. A mistake. I wish we had put it in our schedule earlier and had time to revisit as there is much to see. Do drive ther as it is a LONG walk.",
          "We arrived by city bus. This is a must because parking can be a pain. We walked up the hill to the park department building. It was a cool display showing the history of the area. They had it set up for interactive activities that were primarily set up for kids. They had people",
          "It is smaller than I thought but organized well. My daughter and I watched a short movie. We were impressed by the history. The warm thermo cave and basin have strong sulfur smell (rotten egg) that made us lol.",
          "We expected there to be more at this site but basically it is just the cave (which is smelly!) and a pool. The 'museum' section after the cave showed an informative film on the big screens about Canada which we enjoyed. This attraction won't take you very long to look around but",
          "I had heard about Cave and Basin before visiting Banff, and wasn't sure what to expect. The cave was interesting but smelly, and the basin was an outdoor spring. What I found most interesting were the newly-renovated displays on the national parks of Canada. (I believe they",
          "Where to start...first off this is barely a cave. Its been heavily modified to make a pool of very nasty sulfurous hot water. The air is filled with sulfurous gas and it makes me wish i had my h2s meter with me. Not sure what the concentration is but i was taught to get the heck",
          "Visited in July 2017 with my family. Entrance was free as part of the Canada 150 Anniversary celebrations. We arrived at 10am and there were no crowds. The cave itself was very underwhelming, small covered in concrete and poorly illuminated. The outside museum and displays were",
          "If you go to Banff National Park, you really must visit the Cave and Basin because this is where it all began. Banff would not exist if two CPR workers hadn't stumbled upon the hot springs that you can see right here. You can also read the fascinating history of the park and",

          "Located on the other side of the river, very close to town, a short public bus ride from Banff Ave or around a 20 minute walk from the bridge. This is a wonderful attraction, there is a lot of history here and is one of the very most significant places in Banff National Park.",
          "Believe it or not, early tourism to Banff was the result of warm sulfur springs. A nice visitor's center includes the original cave and the nearby warm springs that attracted visitors. It is about a half hour's walk from the main part of Banff or you can drive to their large",
          "Great place to find out about the early history of the Banff area. Well staffed and maintained. It is worth the time.",
          "We visited mid-afternoon and it was not busy at all. Was quite smelly in the cave itself, therefore we did not linger long, just enough for a picture. There was several employees dressed up in clothing from the early era, each had a story to tell. There is a path that takes you",
          "We found this place to be full of history. Be forewarned that the smell of this natural hot spring can burn your nose. Not the most pleasant smell but what it actually looks like is worth it.",
          "Disappointed by this tour. First there was NO signage informing us where to go / meet. The information said - Park closes at 5:00- our tour was at 8:00 pm. We booked online and after we receive confirmation we didn't get any additional information or details. Very confusing.",
          "This is a great spot to learn about the past and the importance of the hot springs on the Banff area. Free admission in 2017!",
          "We had some time to spare while we waited for our gondola \"appointment\", so we headed to the Cave. It was interesting to see -and smell- the sulfur water. There's a few rooms with historical information which was pretty interesting. The restrooms were very clean. We visited",
          "We visited cave and basin with an eye towards the history of the region and the national parks. The historic cave/pools are interesting but we actually enjoyed the natural areas a bit more. There is a lower walk area that follows along the paths of hot springs before emerging",
          "You will do a great deal of walking, but the sites are interesting. There are friendly people enthuastic about helping and sharing their knowledge. Beautiful location.",
          "Interesting historic site, but not too much to see, can be done in a quick visit. Not sure how much they charge normally (entrance was free due to Canada 150) but it it no more than a cave with water inside and a small exhibit about the place's historical importance.",
          "Viewdecks and boardwalks offer great stunning views! Visit inside the cave and basin is a bit of a challenge for a claustrophobic like me. What made our visit fun is the surprise visit of 3 elks close to the entrance! Close encounter when they walked through the parking area.",
          "This was our second visit here. This time we were part of a tour group. They seem to have more outdoor displays this time. It does not take long to see what they have.",
          "We decided to go to Cave & Basin as a break from the sun, and we were both very happy that we did. I am a tourism management postgraduate, having specialised in attractions I was very intrigued to visit Cave & Basin. It was highly engaging and interactive, using a range of",
          "If you have a super tight schedule in Banff, skip it. But if you have the time, walk from town (about a mile) and make a morning of it. The cave is neat, yes it smells like sulfur, it's a natural hot spring. I particularly enjoyed the history of Canada's national park system.",
          "Lovely spot. Beautiful scenery. Not easy for disabled or non-walkers, tho'. A long walk up hill to get to attraction. Small but interesting cave site. Limited signage and informational materials available. Nice gift shop, nice washrooms. Good place to see origins of Park system",
          "If you're wanting to take a walkabout and smell something stinky, this is the place for you! For Canada's 150, it's free to go and check out. There are some neat art pieces to take in and interpretive actors talking about life way back when. Lots of parking too!",
          "This is a cool place to bring a family with small children. Kids will like it! It features an underground hot spring and short cave with a flat paved trail through it. You could push a stroller here comfortably.",
          "Well worth a visit deep into the cave which is very accessible. Visitor centre around it was interesting. Disappointed with refreshment facilities though.",
          "This is not something I would recommend doing in Banff at all!! It is basically a cave which is inside a building with water that smells awful. There are so many amazing things to do in Banff and this is not one of them. Even the hikes are not scenic, have no challenge or",
          "We went for a walk today and made our way to the caves and basin - thank god we did Enjoyable walk to the site Went inside (and being it's Canada 150 free entry) We all(including our 15 yr old lad) enjoyed the very informative displays/videos etc The views from many various",
          "Walked here - a pleasant stroll and were going to pay to get in when we were told it was free this year. Real bonus although had I paid I would not have been disappointed. Cave is interesting and there was a good film to watch in the centre. A very pleasant place to while away",
          "Our next stop was to the Cave and Basin Historic site. It is located on the side of Sulphur Mountain that we had gone up on the gondola in the morning. The reason it is called Sulphur Mountain is because of the sulfur smell of the natural thermal springs in the side of the",
          "We stopped in here and it is very neat to get to see the original pool as well as the cave pool. It does have a strong soulful smell so be prepared for this when you go in. Nice place to visit though.",
          "Some nice displays and hot springs. Enjoyed a nice walk and read about some interesting facts with the hot springs and the internment camps in the area.",
          "This is so much more than expected. They have made the history of the area come alive with docents who really know their stuff. They can take time with you and actually enjoy helping you understand a key aspect of this area. The film is well presented and the overall site is",
          "Really interesting and informative. Helpful to see how the town was founded and grew. The board walks are lovely.",
          "Well worth the time to take in the Cave and Basin while in Banff. Lots of changes have taken place and they are all worth visiting. Love the stroll along the Bow River from the Cave and Basin. Breathtaking scenery.",
          "Definitely a hidden gem and not as well known. It doesn't require a lot of time but be prepared for the strong sulfur smells.",
          "Simply beautiful. Lots of trails nearby and some history for you buffs out there.... cave was a little small but the outside basin part more then made up for it",
          "The Cave and Basin is interesting, but do not expect Yellowstone type of thermal activity. Actual Cave is pretty small, there is a second \"spring\" outdoors with some very rare snails - extremely small snails - the pool is covered over and there are neat \"encampment\" exhibits",

          "The interactive railroad history that is provided at this park provides visitors an opportunity to learn about the hard life of the men who built the railroad which really made Canada the country that it is today. To be honest, there are better caves in the world, but, if you",
          "One of the best places to visit in Banff - but beware - the smell of sulphur is rather overpowering!!!! The cave and basin plus the really good video presentation in the gallery gives a great insight into the history of Banff.",
          "Great place to learn about the discovery of Banff - we got on the local tour as well as walked around the exhibits at the cave and basin - very informative",
          "This natural treasure is an easy walk from the center of Banff. It is part of the park system. You can walk through a cave that takes you to an underground hot spring. You can also walk up stairs to the hillside and see other examples of natural springs. There are many",
          "The cave was great to see in Canada! We love the sulfur smell and the geology of a geothermal active cave. Also really neat that it's the birthplace of parks Canada. They had some really neat interactive spots in the little museum and they also had old tents and stuff set up",
          "The exhibition itself is a pretty cool place. The cave is beautiful and haunting. The museum is informative and interesting. The day we came they had a model railroad set up for the kids. There are some interesting hikes that start at this location - the marsh boardwalk was",
          "We visited during the pre paid Lantern Tour. The tour was best suited for children. Creative presentation of the history of the site nd creation of National Parks in Canada. Area has several trailheads for a hike.",

          "Although I have been to Banff four times, this was the first time I saw the Cave and Basin National Historic Site. Very interesting. The museum was nice too. There were living displays outside showing the way things were back in the day. Not sure how much it costs normally",
          "Came here as it is free admission and left with a better understanding of the local culture. Recommended to stop by here for a short visit if one's time permits.",
          "We had plenty of time and wanted to check this out. It was somewhat interesting, but it is not a priority if in Banff. It has a good multimedia presentation.",
          "Was a trip through some amazing times by people in the past. I recommed this tour to everyone. I couldn't believe the things I discovered while doing this tour",
          "This is the site of the original hot springs cave that started Banff and the national park system in Canada. We enjoyed the historic information, displays, and old photos detailing the history of the hot sprins in the area. They also had a replica of an old railroad camp with",

          "Sorely disappointed. It's small, hot, smells bad (sulpher!), & perhaps this is simply an issue of expectations, but we were (not pleasantly) surprised Canada's national parks originated with a desire to protect this space rather than the thousands of beautiful spots surrounding",
          "\"Banff Cave and Basin\" are a cave with a crystal clear pool within it that comes from Sulphur Mountain and as such smells of sulphur and the Basin is a similar pool on the outside of the cave. Pros: Interesting history as to how it was found and what it was used for Lovely",

          "Informative, fascinating. Pleasant walks outside and very interesting history inside. Definitely worth taking half an hour to wander through.",
          "Enjoyed our stop at the Cave and Basin, very interesting to learn about and see inside the cave...also walked a bit of the trail but didn't go too far as I had my older parents with me...I even found the red lawn chairs that are found in parks all across Canada! #sharethechair",

          "The actual Cave & Basin interpretative Centre and closed hot pool, due to snail breeding which was a concern to many not smart environmentalists. The closure did not change the breeding population of the little tiny wind snails. The spring fed hot springs water that comes out",
          "It's small but worth it if you've got time and are in the area. The cave itself can get crowded but there are other things to do as well in the same \"building\" such as look at an interactive historical expo and see a small geothermal pool and read about the history of the place.",
          "It was interesting to see(and smell!) the pools, but had we had to pay an entry fee then we would have felt a bit underwhelmed. Make sure to visit the small museum to the First World War interns, out the back. It is easily missed but very interesting.",
          "Yes, it smells like sulphur. The cave itself is pretty cool and they have an educational center which the kids (ages 4 and 9) really enjoyed. It's not somewhere to spend hours, but is definitely worth stopping by to check out!",
          "Recommend joining the tour if you want to learn about the history of the national park and the hot springs. The actually cave is really small and the pictures you see are really all there is to it. I still think it's a nice stop if you have never been. Recommend.",
          "This was part of our morning tour of Banff and its national park. It has good historical interest but as a site now, it's rather underwhelming to experience. More interesting is the preservation of the area for the tiny snails that live in the hot springs.",
          "Highly recommend this visit. Great historical context and the basin and caves are both very interesting.",
          "This is a a quick, historical stop or you can take some time to utilize some of the hiking trails in the back. We did the Marsh Loop which was gorgeous, but bring bug spray!"

          "If you buy a pass to the hot springs you can also come to the cave as well. Just have to ask for the right pass which wasn\u2019t too expensive. I thought it was awesome I could explore two places, and they are close to eachother. I went in \u2026",
          "Great place to check out and learn more about where you live and the history around it. My kids did the explorer's activity and it was great fun and a great learning experience. The staff were amazing and helpful. There is also 103 sites \u2026",
          "For $7.90 per adult it's worth seeing the history and imagining what it would have been like in the early century. It's free if you have a Discovery Pass. I mean that's what our national parks are about. If you're looking for a huge cave, \u2026",
          "Cave and Basin was a fun place to stop with the family and learn all about the history of Banff. They had a hot springs pool in the cave. You can\u2019t swim or course and it smells strongly of hydrogen sulfide anyways so you wouldn\u2019t want to! \u2026",
          "We were here this summer...we absolutely loved this place.  The staff was super friendly.  We loved the music and dance..it was awesome that they allowed the tourists to join the traditional dance and even taught how to to use the spoons to play music.    Looking forward to go again",
          "It's very educating. Learnt about history. Super friendly staff. Played few games and games were more educations. Spl thanks to Ms.Allison who shared her knowledge with us. Kids were exploring the entire time. And last but not the least, \u2026",
          "Super cool cave and nice history. Highly reccomend.",
          "Not really much to do or see here but it's a little neat going inside the cave. You can smell the sulphur in there for sure. There's a little pathway above the cave to go around to see the natural hot water flow through. You cannot disturb the water though due to rare snails that live inside there. Nice place for a quick stop.",
          "more than a cave, it is a full museum with 4 areas to view & play & watch a short film. This is a piece of Canada's history & we enjoyed very much. Clean, organized, and educational. I could have shared more than 100 photo so much to see & learn in beautiful Banff, AB, Canada.",
          "Things to know: The cave is very small BUT still beautiful. We really enjoyed the re-enactments they did, thought it was a theatrical and fun touch to learn about the nearby history. \n\nAlso, we made a funny sign.",
          "Beautiful place and lots to learn and explore. Staff are wonderful. Will definitely come back and recommend.",
          "Cave and Basin use to be an active pool for the hot springs, however it is a historic site now with a small but educational museum. I recommend this for families to understand the history of the national parks in Canada.",
          "Informative and interesting history. Enjoyed seeing the snails. H2S smell somewhat unpleasant but what do you expect?",
          "Birthplace of Banff. The cave is not as big as I expected but still a treasure box of history nevertheless. Great canvas film with surrounding sound. Admission clerk warmly welcomed us.",
          "Was a interesting place. Fun to see. Unfortunate that you cant go in the hot springs. But nice to hear about the history of the place.",
          "Love this place lots to see. We love the cave p.s duck going into the cave especially if your tall",
          "This place is cool. Haven't been here since I was super young. It's nice that they completed it like they have.",
          "The rare tourist trap in an otherwise generally magical Banff national park. The cave and basin are each the size of a two car garage, they are within a hundred yards of each other, and neither are remotely interesting. Skip this one.",
          "A fantastic stop if your in the banff area. Free access if you have a parks pass, but less than 5$ a person without it. Interesting historical site with many nice photo opportunities.  Everything worth seeing can be done in about 1-1.5hrs, so a great option to kill half an afternoon.",
          "It was a neat place to go and see. For a national park like Banff it is interesting to see where it all began. In addition to the cave and basin themselves there is plenty of infographics and movies about the history and culture surrounding \u2026",
          "Interesting historical site in the city of Banff. Just a heads up, the smell of sulphur (eggs) is pretty overpowering near the pools but all things considered it's a pretty neat place.",
          "Fun and affordable they have really maximized space to show you everything they can of this historic site. The tour was informative and the guide was very helpful",
          "Its just a small area with one cave and an outdoor spring. Its good to visit it once and don\u2019t forget to read the history behind this cave as it takes you back in time. ticket is just CAD $3.5 per person which is reasonable but its worth visiting at-least once.",
          "We thought the experience would be different than what we saw. Not a bad place and it is filled with history.  The workers were fun and happy.",
          "Very amazing snails can survive in hot springs, it is worth an hour to learn about the history of the hot springs and the discovery of national parks. One of the red chairs in Banff National Park\uff01",
          "There\u2019s nothing to see here, unless it\u2019s your first time to see a cave and basin. I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like it, but there\u2019s really nothing to see here friends. We liked the tour guide though and he\u2019s really good in acting!!",
          "So educational and informative, and also such a fun place to visit! Definitely add it to your must do list! There's no admission cost if you have the National Park Pass!",
          "This was a nice quiet place to visit after a week of long hiking.  The cave itself was very pretty. Couldn't stay too long because of the strong sulfur smell. Our pictures turned out beautifully. It was inexpensive too.",
          "It's good, there is a small cave and a basin. They have a small playground with curling, ice hockey, castle making with ice Legos which was particularly fun.",
          "There is a huge parking lot, nice cafe and ticket center and this place carries a lot of history. The cave itself was not that exciting animal sure , you wouldn't want to spend more than a minute in there. Its technically not a cave at all, \u2026",
          "Neat place to visit, small cave with basin/pool full of the sulphurus water, curling games outside and friendly staff!",
          "There really isn't much here. The cave is the most interesting part but it's tiny and not kept in a natural state. It's deliberately being preserved to milk the cash cow that is tourism. I personally thought that was a bit weird. You wouldn't be missing much if you decided to skip this one.",
          "Very well maintained. Smells of sulphur, obviously but adds to its authenticity. It's beautiful. There are some hikes around that are supposedly amazing",
          "Canada's first national park!  Tons of information, history, hosts teaching lessons.   There was some good videos and interactive displays.  I really enjoyed learning about the life that has sprung up around the hot springs.",
          "I was kinda hungry and I was hoping to catch some snails to snack on but I didn\u2019t see any :( I had fun though like y\u2019all there\u2019s so many cool little streams and ponds and like everything is frozen but they\u2019re just like vibin being like warm and smelling like farts n stuff like wow.",
          "Lovely sight and they even had outdoor games. That were winter themed",
          "The history about this place is great and unique. The place itself though isn't anything special. Though it's cheap and still worth it I'd say",
          "Great, awesome cave and basin, only worth it because we have the banff pass",
          "Amazing! Lots of quick little hikes in the area. \n\nQuick tip. If you are there to hike only you do not need to pay the cave and basin fee. That is only for the museum/exhibit. We made the mistake and waisted our money. If you do go to hike, be sure to put your parking pass on your dash or taped to your window.",
          "The \"cave and basin\" are both quite small, but really interesting to check out and learn about. There is a lot of learning opportunities at the historic site to make up for the size. However for just under $4 for admission, you really can't go wrong.",
          "Definitely worth a visit as interesting place with cave, sulphur hot springs and detailed history/guide. You can opt for a short boarded walk, a longer trail and also a nearby hour long walk around the marsh land to see insects and other wildlife. Children under 17 free.",
          "Lots to lean about how the national parks came to be, the hot springs, and endangered hot springs snails. \n\nJust behind the cave and basin in a separate not well advertised building is a small museum dedicated to explaining the WWII banff \u2026",
          "This was my first Canadian National Park site and it was well maintained. The rangers were knowledgeable and very willing to help explain the natural wonders that the cave held. Do the tour that is included with the ticket because the history and chance to have the tiny snails pointed out to you is very worth it.",
          "Historically and visually interesting place. The cave itself is small but I found the upper board walks (located above the cave)  more interesting. It got very crowded in the cave, though. Recommended if you have time.",
          "I will never forget the smell of Sulphur as strong as the one in this cave I\u2019m standing in.\ud83d\ude37 A picture is definitely worth a thousand smells.\ud83d\ude0d",
          "The actual cave is located a short walk after the ticket/shop building. Cave is accessed thru a tunnel after a closed door to keep the moisture inside. Its warm humid and dark inside. Tried but didnt get good picture. Front lens soon get \u2026",
          "Great historical museum with some interesting exhibits. The discovery tour is highly recommended, especially if Gabriel is the one running it. He truly captured the essence of Infotainment.",
          "Surprisingly interesting place! I was expecting it to be really kitschy, but it has a ton of information about the formation of Canada's National Parks and how they have developed throughout the years. The cave itself is really small, but \u2026",
          "The cave photos in the listing make it look cooler than it is. It\u2019s a small hallway that leads to an opening with a small pool of water. You can look at the water, take a photo and turn around. The entire \u201ccave\u201d portion last minutes. If \u2026",
          "It was very interesting to learn about the discovery of the cave, the use of the hot springs, and the history of the building as a poolhouse. The one thing I couldn\u2019t agree with was the way they disrupted the natural order of things in many \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Smells of sulfur everywhere but the place is full of things to see and read. Includes the cave itself which cannot be swam in because of and endangered species of snail, a gallery, museum, top and bottom of the cave, and a small hike up the hill with nice information  along the way all for a fee of 3.80 a person.",
          "Great presentation of natural and human history relating to the site and also to Parks Canada development across the nation. Excellent in all respects!",
          "We had a wonderful time, but did not see any snails.",
          "If you want a unique experience with nature, you have to check out this area. It offers natural hot springs and hiking trails. There's even a little cave, awesome courtyard which makes it feel like you're in a fairytale.",
          "A lovely winter walk.  Will be coming back.",
          "So cool! We took the guided tour through the cave and learned so much about the history of the area and the facility.  The cave itself is a little small but beautiful nonetheless. Would recommend if you have a free day in Banff.",
          "kids under 17 are free.. each adult is 8 dollars..\n\nEndless amounts of History Totally worth it.",
          "Beautiful history. The cave is really worth seeing. There is an admission fee, but if you have park pass then you don't have to pay",
          "Worth a visit! Where it all started for the national parks of Canada.. The scenery is breathtaking. Visit the cave and take the guided tour to understand the history!",
          "Fabulous attraction with an informative tour of the facility (at scheduled times). Very reasonable entry price as well. \nStunning trail right beside the site.",
          "Loved this historic place. This is the first time I am visiting any Cave. Loved the environment and movies are so educative, any age group would have enjoy watching.",
          "We loved this part of our trip! The cave was definitely worth seeing. We are so glad we had a discovery pass so we could get in for free!",
          "Hated the sulfuric smell, but it was nice to see the cave and basin. I'm giving it 4 stars, because I didn't find there was much to see/do there.  Nevertheless I can say I've been there, and smelled sulfur!! \ud83d\ude43",
          "Really fun historic location. They have a few guided tours which are awesome. The cave it's self does smell a bit like sulfur, but is to be expected of a natural spring. The cave was very crowded as I went on a rainy day. A large portion of \u2026",
          "This is a wonderful site to visit to get some.history of the area. The parks people are wonderful to educate you. It is inexpensive and if you have a yearly park pass you don't pay more money. Check the operating hours though as they are a bit odd.",
          "It is a beautiful place and good trails for hiking. we visited in the winter but we had a beautiful weather so it was an easy trail.",
          "Interesting historical place. Nice boardwalk areas with lots of explanatory signage. Best part is the short walk through a tunnel to the cave area. Note that you can't swim anywhere here - for that you need to go to the nearby Upper Hot Springs.",
          "Beutiful and mirror like. the glacial waters are very still and tranquil. Mosqito spray is a must! With out it, you will get eaten alive!",
          "Outstanding place. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable. Birdlife abundant. Great to see this remarkable bit of history preserved",
          "It's a good place to visit to get away from the intense foot traffic of Banff, but the overpowering smell of the cave won't make you want to stay long.\n\nAdmission is fair, especially when it is lumped in with your Discovery Pass, but there \u2026",
          "Very cool spot. Only downfall of your disabled or temporarily disabled I would recommend NOT going.. as I had a horrible time climbing flight after flight of stairs",
          "A great value for a very informative look into some of Canada's history.",
          "It was a great the basin that the water fall into an the over head of it was amazing",
          "First, be aware that it costs to get in. It isn't expensive a all.\n\nThe history at this site is amazing. The only shame is that the actual swimming pool couldn't be kept. The rules and regulations, or lack of back in the day was amazing. \u2026",
          "Visited here on a rainy day. Very interesting to find out about the site, with lots of information boards. Nice to see the pools and some friendly staff giving guidance. Included admission with the Parks Canada pass.",
          "You should take this little tour, it's worth it. The employee was very knowledgeable and gave us a lot of information about the history of this cave .",
          "The cave is too small and not worth to see. However, the hot spring pool located near to this place is absolutely worth going ($8).",
          "interesting spot to investigate. Is worth going to have a look.",
          "Alex guide and other staff were very warm and welcoming, shared historical facts keeping everyone engaged, answered questions patiently. Visiting the Cave and the museum itself was a nice experience. Must visit!",
          "The Canadian park services have done an amazing job at this location.  The cave entrance is inside the main building and there is an entire exhibit detailing the history of the cave and the local area. \nAllow time to walk the boardwalk \u2026",
          "Not worth it and pictures are deceiving. Its a very small cave inside a building and there is a charge to see.",
          "The winter festival was very disappointing. Not worth a visit.",
          "I love the outdoor and free hike around this area and the signage is very informative. You can also see the basin from the free hike. The only reason to go in the museum though is to see the cave. With a toddler we did not spend very long inside the museum as there wasn't too much to do.",
          "Honestly, dont go there, even if it's really cheap, there's nothing to except disgusting water \ud83d\ude23\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22",
          "The birthplace of Canada's national parks. Don't expect a Yellowstone national park but do take time view the museums and the nature trails. If you are lucky you will see a cave snail. Small cave with a spring, one open spring outdoors. It \u2026",
          "Free with a Parks Canada pass which is nice! It's small but we had a lot of fun there. I thought it was educational but also had things to do like go into the cave (super cool), the photobooth & the winter carnival! We spent most of our \u2026",
          "The cave itself wasn't the star for me. I would say everything else was enchanting ~ the hikes, the spring fed pool, the Townsend's warbler I saw, the nature and historical museum were highlights. Definitely worth the trip!",
          "Beautiful hike trails along side gorgeous bow river and woods. Horse rides on trails available as group tour, plenty of car parking, ticket for C$3.50, a souvenir store is there. No restaurant",
          "Such a fun place to bring our 1 year old!",
          "If you're in Banff and have some time to kill, this is a great spot to stop by. With some light reading you can learn a lot about the history of the location and nearby hotsprings. At the time of my visit there was an exhibit that focused \u2026",
          "Not bad little place. Nothing special though",
          "Small cave and spring location - for viewing only. Beautiful building and location",
          "Smaller than expected but still Very Cool to see where it all started",
          "I had large expectations for the cave and basin based on the photos that I saw. I believe this is the one location I've visited so far where the photos were better than the real thing. As for the remainder of the site it had beautiful \u2026",
          "Time well spent among Nature's wonders.",
          "The cave was cool and It was great to see the birth place of the park system.",
          "Cave and Basin National Historic Site is a wonderful place to discover. You can visit the cave, the outside basin, the streams and the marshland. There are several expositions and video presentations. The entrance fee is also really fair. If you come to Banff, you need to visit this place.",
          "Excellent architectural attraction, worth the admission, watch the videos or wear walking shoes & go for a hike",
          "This is always an interesting stop for the whole family. And its usually not all that busy from our experience. They've definitely upgraded this place over the years. Oh, and remember don't touch the water.",
          "Was cool to see...one of the guides took the time to explain about the snails and how they survive.",
          "For the price, this was by far the best value place we visited during our week in Banff National Park..We joined one of the free tours, the guide was very knowledgeable and the tour, which involved several actors, was extremely entertaining. I highly recommend visiting.",
          "Just stunning! The dimply lit dark cave with a stunning lit Sulphur water pond just left us awestruck. I don't think words can do it justice as the photos do. Just worth a visit.",
          "A pleasant Experience. But small but interesting to know this is where Parks Canada's was born.",
          "This is so beautiful, it is breath taking. The river is amazing and it has such an amazing view. I love it!",

          "Great place to visit while in Banff\nThe have a lot of informative displays, a great story telling on huge display screens, some fun games for kids.\nThe cave itself was beautiful. But watch out for low roof.\nP.S. entry is free for those who \u2026",

          "Good place to learn and teach..\nGood place for kids too..",
          "Was definitely worth a visit cool as to see and a cheaper attraction, but only needed a ten minute stop. Prepare for the smell! It's awful!",
          "Smelly but very beautifull and well explained",
          "Nothing much to see but history for this place is interesting nice trails to walk",
          "Enjoyed our adventure here! Cheap admission and fun for the kids! They have an activity book for kids and they have to complete five of the activities in the book to receive a prize. \nInteresting over all and nice experience.",
          "Interesting, and informative about mineral springs and historical events. Great little activities for kids like photo booth, curling, bean bag toss and mini hockey area. Adults pay $3.90 plus tax and kids 17 and under are free.",
          "Worth a quick visit",
          "There was a long path, that took me about 45 minutes to get halfway through it. Lots of pollen. Not recommended for people who have pollen allergies! It's still fun though!",
          "This is an amazing site to go to\nHistory  and nature all on one it is a must see when out west",
          "Good place to visit while in the park. Free with discovery pass. The hike is good to see what the natural pools looked like too",
          "You can feel the heat from the pools, admission isn\u2019t very much, around $3. Smells like sulphur but not overpowering",

          "More beautiful in pics than there. Too hot inside",
          "One of the places that you must Are if you are visiting Banf. Easy to acces. Sometimes little bit crowded depending on the time of the year you visit. If you bring your park pass entry Is free.\nNice exposition about history of Banf national park.",
          "Great historic site, birthplace of Canada's national parks",
          "Only $3 to enter, but wasn't really much to see.  The cave was cool, but it was just a single chamber and wasn't much to it.",
          "A great time at the Alberta Beer Festival.",
          "Awesome.. I learned something",
          "Cool place to visit with a hidden little surprise :)",

          "Sulfur smell gets to you, but overall, very informative and beautiful!",
          "A must to visit place in Banff downtown. However it is not that big  but has many things to offer. \nFirst, you will have an idea of unique organisms which live in warm water at high Sulphur content. Then, you are going to see some of the \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience! Everything was clean and guest services were very knowledgable. Parking lot was big so finding a place to park wasnt too bad. Its extremely cheap to go too so I'd add it to your list of things to do in banff for sure!!",
          "Crawling right into the original hotspring cave alone is worth it. Wonderfully preserved original. There is also a nice boardwalk around the upper area feeding the cave.",
          "Walked the Marsh Loop. Very beautiful, but be aware this is shared with horses, so you'll need to watch your step.",
          "I really enjoyed this historical site. It definitely shed some light on a part of Canadian History that i have no idea of. Plus, i loved the walks you can go on after you exit the Site. Worth $3.50!!!!",
          "I was skeptical but actually was quite interesting for a few spare hours. The actual cave stunk from the sulphur so be warned! I feel there could\u2019ve been more as some exhibits were underwhelming",
          "Knowledgeable staff to explain all the features of this historic site. Maintained well.",
          "Lovely place to visit in banff.  Has a lot of history.  Go on one of the free tours to get the ultimate experience. There's a llittle gate fee of less than $5",
          "As you climb up the stairs, you get amazing views! Just stunning! The climb up is free. You get to see a little sign of where Banff's first hotel was, and a some natural hot springs with that classic sulfuric smell!\nIf you want to go into \u2026",
          "Small museum inexpensive good background on the Canadian park system as a whole.   The cave itself is impressive if not massive.",
          "Fun little place and not at all expensive to visit! Definitely check out the boardwalk trail behind the centre. The short and easy trail weaves its way up Sulpher Mountain following the thermal spring and offers a great view of the site. \n\nThat said, if you are travelling on a budget or short on time, this is an easy spot to skip.",

          "Interesting place to understand how national parks were born in Canada and to spend one hour or so.",
          "Wasn't as advertised. Thought we were going into a large tunnel, it was short. Hit my head on the ceiling and the fumes from the water made us a bit sick. Pros the cost was good and as we saw a dear and Elk roaming around outside",
          "First time visit and really enjoyed it. More of a space for adults but enough interactive items to keep the kids interested for a little while. The cave is well worth the visit, despite the sulphur smell! The basin is interesting and \u2026",
          "Really nice experience at the cave and bassin. Really close to banff so it's not a detour. The cave itself is small, but you really go there for the history of the place. You have a nice path in the forest and you get to see the thermal \u2026",
          "Cheap admission (about $4) but the cave was pretty small and the basin was a bit lacklustre. Most interesting part was how this was the starting point for creating a conservation area as Banff national park.",
          "Beautiful park attraction. Lots of history about the national parks available and once you get over the smell of farts it becomes amazing. Walking the path in the winter is magical. 5/5",
          "This place is the combination of cave, basins, and landscape. Each one could stands alone as the tourist attraction for its uniqueness and beauty.",
          "You were warned\nSulphar does smell....\nOther than the slight discomfort due to smell, it was an awesome museum style park!",
          "Very Good for History lovers.",
          "Beautiful day to check out some incredible history. Such a gorgeous setting. Got some stunning pictures.",
          "Well run\n Very efficient flow and layout.\nVery informative story boards along the route.",
          "Super cool place lots of history with views that are breathtaking and you can get in for free just show your national parks pass. This is a \ud83d\udccd\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
          "Amazing historic site with fascinating history and background. Well presented information and with great interactive displays. Beautiful setting and great customer service - very child-friendly with a \u2018treasure-hunt\u2019 resulting in some great rewards and keep-sakes, totally free. Well worth a visit.",
          "Kudos to Parks Canada for maintaining this site. Sulfur springs all over globe are tourist attractions and polluted. This one though, is well maintained and clean. To me, a little cave with hot water pool was a pretty sight. If you are \u2026",
          "Complete and utter zero worth visiting. The cave is more like a closet in the wall. The entire building is miniscule; the most important part seem to be the snails, not the water, nor the history. Snails it is, and snails you shall get.",
          "Awesome place to walk around and learn about the history of Banff.",
          "Small but powerful experience. Great place to take people from out of the country. Takes about an hour. Only $3.50 to enter. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "Unexpected hot sulfur springs in this setting.  Excellent tour presentation",
          "This is a hot spring that was discovered by 03 men, many many years ago ! They had dug a shaft downwards to enter the hot water (hot spring) which they discovered. A Hot Water Spring in this part of the world, during terribly cold winters was a priceless discovery !",
          "The cave is cool. Cheap to enter and fast to see everything. I did everything in 15 minutes",
          "Good history place. But when entering the cave close your nose because it smells nasty inside there due to the natural process, otherwise good experience.",
          "Ir is a nice little place, well kept and with lots of information to read. If you go with kids make sure to ask for the explorers guide booklet.",
          "Cave and Basin in Banff National Park is a must see. The birthplace of the National Parks in Canada.",
          "What a fun, historical place. You learn something new every time you're there.",
          "Pretty amazing, views are incredible. Very first National park in Canada. Did I mention the views are indescribable",
          "Interesting spot for some history of the area and to see a smelly cave. Natures a pretty cool thing.\n\nI would definitely say if you\u2019re wandering around Banff looking for things in the area this takes little time and it\u2019s worth the visit. \n\nI\u2019ve been to Banff many times but only just recently stopped here and I\u2019m happy I did.",
          "Little exhibit. Trails around info center are good.",
          "Place is nice and preserved.. guy at the counter was nice i was there 4:30 of july 16",
          "Amazing views, good for hiking, historical place",
          "Interesting place to see once but not a must see if you don't have enough time in Banff! I wasn't impressed.",
          "Really not worth of your time and effort.\nA very small puddle with some snails.\nBetter visit a real cave than this small Banff hole. Banff has more beautiful places to visit",
          "Smaller than I thought it would be but a neat place to see where the Canadian nps started",
          "Had to rush through it since we got there late, but it is a very cool historical site.  Would recommend.",
          "They are called hot springs because they are springy and hot at the same time.",
          "Interesting history,  interactive exhibits,  and the cave and mineral pools were very interesting.",
          "Visit on your last day of the trip.. where you just want to relax and return back home...",
          "Cool little walk around, with lots of history and only cost $3.50",
          "Ok with reasonable entry fee. Not much to see or do",
          "I tought it was big but only one very small basin, nice for the history",
          "nice place, but strong sulfur smell, which is a part of the experience.",
          "Very interesting well maintained scenic nature walks outside of the Cave and Basin! Some interesting and unique wildlife in the naturally warm water.",
          "Its unique it has a egg smell to it but if you are in banff you should go there to check it out",
          "Nice site to visit. Interesting displays about the history about the cave and basin. Scientific tidbits about the importance of conserving the ecosystem around the hot spring. Nice casual trail to see some hard to notice birds and flora \u2026",
          "The tour was informative,  but the site wasn't as impressive as I thought it would.",
          "Important to the ecology and history of the area, this is the first discovered hot springs. Guided tour available, boardwalk below the cave and outflow of heated water into shallow lakes and bogs have changed the Flora and fauna; Oddly released subtropical fish can be seen. Bird blind available. Interesting.",
          "Informative about the early life of canadians",
          "It's cool the cave is small don't except a huge walk in a cave and be adventurous, very informative good historical information, not a whole lot to see, but it's worth to go if you have never been",
          "Historical site and beautiful cave. Not much to see compared with the rest of Banff. Make sure to get your discovery ticket with you for a free entrance.",
          "Easy hike, but lots of parking and nice views.",
          "Interesting! Glad I visited. Very inexpensive.",
          "This is a single cave which smells of hydrogen sulphide.  No springs to bathe in anymore, for that you need to go to Banff Upper Springs.  Be prepared to be underimpressed.  Some nice scenic walks around the facility.",
          "Beautiful location, most of the interesting stuff is actually outside",
          "Interesting, but you don't need much time to see it. .. did not hike the trail, so don't know about that...",
          "A great visit, cool cave, nice museum with lots of history.",
          "Very informatic - the guides were helpful and knowledgable, clean and airie \u263a",
          "Kind of disappointing, the history is neat but not a lot to see.",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, the cave itself is dark and the pool inside is not very impressive. Smells strongly of sulfur but this is to be expected. The outside pool was prettier with blue water. Interesting history of the park service.",
          "Fantastic interactive exhibits, a real trip to the past and look to the future.",
          "Free admission for 6 adults if you have the annual National Park pass. Children under 17 is also free.",
          "Informative exhibit. Nice easy hike. Great natural 4D experience of what it would\u2019ve felt like back when it was first discovered. Nice friendly staff.",
          "We went on the lantern tour.  It was fun and the interpreters/actors did a great job.",
          "Complete tourist trap and waste of time and $7. Cave was completely flooded with tourists and you can't even walk. Cave without people would literally take 30 seconds to see. Hard Pass",
          "Friendly service,  a cool little place for history.  Take your time and explore the cave and the surrounding,  its pretty cool.",
          "Beautiful and so soothing to listen to!!\nI only wish we could touch the water!\n\nTip: If you follow the short walking trail across from the entrance, you can touch the water by the bridge, after it comes out of the basin. Without getting in trouble..! Lol\ud83d\udca9",
          "A pretty cave and small pools of spring water. More valuable as a historical site than one for viewing. Read about the history and look at the old photos and then walk into the area that used to be the pool house and pool and you'll get an \u2026",
          "The cave is tiny, but very picturesque. Holds minimal foot traffic but is quite a peaceful place once quiet to relax, have a nice chat and put your feet up, literally. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Cool spot but very small.  Not a lot there",
          "Really enjoyed stopping in and see this",
          "It's called the birth place of Banff. First site found of Banff national park. If you have been to any other caves then you would probably not be interested in this one. Super small and smelly",
          "Fun day trip and will do it again.",
          "Interesting place to bring your kids and make them busy. If you have the park pass be sure to bring it with you because then it\u2019s free",
          "It was interesting to see, but not that much.  Its good for walking around.",
          "Cool little cave with a natural hot spring in it. It was smaller than I expected and you are in and out of the cave in a matter of two to five minutes. But you do get to take a little self guided tour around the place which was interest and \u2026",
          "Smaller than I was expecting but so cool to see and experience",
          "Very educational trip!!! Let's save the earth to stop melting down the glaciers in the high mountains.",
          "I just visited the cave and it was kind of smelly and unimpressive. A lot of better attractions around ot though.",
          "The Birthplace of Canada's national parks.  The photos on display and location of the original Hotel, make you realise just how on the edge of the modern world this was.  The smell of Hydrogen Sulphide is not overwhelming - but that is subjective.\n Shame they had to close over the pools,",
          "Awesome place! Loved the Interpretative center. Can spend all day there",
          "Interesting! No one warns you about the smell though! Sulphur!",
          "Amazing I have been twice and I would still go back again",
          "Beautiful but smells like eggs because of the sulfur.",
          "Great historical information center. Under renovations but didnt hamper the experience. Staff was friendly and of course the cave and basin was awesome. Natural wonders at there best.",
          "Was awake!! Fascinating",
          "Amazing spot . The trail has great views",
          "Wasn't expecting the smell, but beautiful sights",
          "Very small tourist spot. Wish there were more caves and things to see. Only had a cave and outdoor hot spring to see",
          "It was a stinky experience. The museum was gutted unfortunately. Oh and... Save the snails!",
          "A short drive from downtown Banff with decent amount of parking space. Admission price for adults is around 4 dollars, but it is free if you have a discovery national park pass. A very informative exhibit featuring the history of Banff \u2026",
          "3.50$ and I'm convinced the cave is man made. Reminds me of Yogi's cave at Kings Dominion.",
          "Really unique space. Very pretty. Keep in mind it is sulphuric so it will smell. Loved the area up top and the display space. Good value",
          "This place is a must, perfect for the whole family, it will take you about an hour to see the place, they have free parking, the staff are very knowledgeable and fun, we learned so many things while we were there, such a great place",
          "Very informative, a must see",
          "Very cool to see the natural sulfurous pools. I'm glad that this place and its history is being preserved. It wasn't too busy when we went on a weekend in June. Tip: If you have kids (or even if you don't!) ask for the kids activity booklet and submit the last page to a worker to get a free dog tag that says Cave and Basin on it.",
          "great time with the kids! Winter festival and Warmer temps made for a great afternoon! The staff were great and informative!",
          "Beautiful place. Entry was free on Canada day!",
          "Closes too early but very neat to see",
          "Best life experiences ever . Good place to visit",
          "Beautiful historic site. Well worth the visit.",
          "Beer fest was excellent. Would love to come back next year",
          "This place is a little gem full of history. The birth place of Canadian Park system.  Plenty of info to read, interactive screens, videos and film of the history. The boardwalk takes you around the site. There is a cave the original site \u2026",
          "Excellent experience and the tour was very good, special thanks to Julia for the wonderful tour",
          "Ride or walk to Sundance canyon. Perfect walk for a date or to just to enjoy the day",
          "Pretty good but dont expect to go into a long tunneling cave! It's short and sweet but it's worth checking out!",
          "It\u2019s just a few minutes drive from Banff downtown. \nOnce you park you notice the smell. It\u2019s pretty intense when you get into the cave. A first sight is not that spectacular but when you picture it, I guess the camera gets colors you don\u2019t. \nIt\u2019s an interesting place I would recommend considering is only 4$ per adult.",
          "Please start selling Banff national Park day passes here \u2600\ufe0f",
          "Nice place, but be prepared for strong odor!",
          "Definitely worth the stop, dont mind the smell of sulphur Haha",
          "Like the old swimming pools better, cave is cool though",
          "Very cute park! Worth the admission fee of less than $4 per adult, but it becomes free if you have the annual pass! Lots of great displays for children and adults alike. We especially enjoyed the grotto!",
          "Good landscapes and very fair rates. We did not spend more than 30 minutes there and I feel like we got to know it in depth. There's a free parking lot which is also appreciated :)",
          "A small cave, with just one entrance and exit and people staying for more than 30 minites. (5 is enough)",
          "This is the first national park that was designated in Canada. The hot spring is kind of nice it's not very big; the interpretive wardens / Rangers are very nice and gave a great tour. We love the living history part of the site.",
          "Interesting but underwhelming considering how many other more interesting places you could spend your time in the area",
          "Definitely an awesome place to cross off the list if you're visiting. It smells because of the sulphur but it's super cool in the cave. You can also go view it from the top. They also have some exhibits out inside and in the summer they do stuff outside, too. Won't be a long trip here so plan more for your day!",
          "Nice place to go for some history about parks canada and a quick hike. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Free admission for pass holder.",
          "Great place to learn a out Banff Park History, and entertaining for kids as well.",
          "I really like this place",
          "Great place! The cave was beautiful and the trails (with little hot springs) was the best part. There were also other winter activities. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and the museum had informative exhibits. Highly recommended",
          "My husband and I loved our visit here. It was very cool to be able to go right into the cave and to learn so much of Banff's history",
          "Very cool location to tour, nice place to take a walk in the mountains. Be wary of the strong sulfur smell around the park",
          "The cave and basin are each very cool to look at, and the views from the building to the mountains are nice. However, the smell from the sulfur is very strong and not recommended for those with a weak stomach, because there is no escaping \u2026",
          "Way over hyped. Very small cave. Decent for a 5 min stop...",
          "Easy accessible, very educational, both the small museum at the entrance and cave itself (Small but relevant for the sulfurous hot spring phenomenon ). Various events in the front courtyard- July wildlife photo exhibition, etc. take place \u2026",
          "We got married and had our reception at the Cave and Basin in June, 2018 and it was the most wonderful experience. The staff went above and beyond to make it everything we dreamed of! A wedding coordinator is a must at this venue and Locke \u2026",
          "The cave and basin is fascinating. The hot springs are really neat especially in the winter. I loved the little hike around back where you can see all the pools and the water bubbling up. Seeing minnows swimming in pools while everything \u2026",
          "Small cave, crowded, felt almost like a tourist trap... Though very reasonable price, just expected more caves.",
          "Great part of Canadian history and well worth your time.  The cave site is well organized and a great way to learn about the development of the area and Parks Canada.  I would hike there as it adds some exercise to the outing. You should visit as it is the reason you are here!",
          "Not overly exciting. The pictures made it look better than it actually was. We paid 7$ to walk around and go into this small smelly cave. It was more so to say we went there and because it was a national historic site but really not worth it at all.",
          "You will have free admission with your annual Park pass.",
          "Very interesting something everyone who comes to banf should see.",
          "Very good to visit and learn a few historical lessons.",
          "The cave and hot springs are cool, great short trail above the building, we saw several deer. Wish they'd bring back the pool!",
          "Educational and very nice, an hourish visit. Free of charge for the seasonal pass holders.",
          "A good spot to visit near Banff. The main affection is the hot spring in the cave and the unique snails that live in it. I like the video presentation in the main hall illustrating not just Cave and Basin but the whole Canada. The staffs are very friendly.",
          "It was interesting to see a little busy on a Saturday afternoon. Great for kids lots if interactive items.",
          "U can go through the historic part of this cave \nNothing much to see though \nBut one time visit is not bad.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Lots of history. Cave is small and smells strongly of sulphur which might bother sensitive people.",
          "Unique, interesting, historic, affordable, great staff, wonderful overall message",
          "Interesting stories about the hot springs. Did not appreciate all the climate change propaganda.",
          "Can definitely pass this \"attraction.\" Front desk lady was mad that we came late and that we wouldn't be able to see everything. She said it would take at least an hour. We strolled around for fifteen minutes taking pictures and left early. Just look at photos on Google and move on.",
          "Nice explanatory signs guide you to the famous source of the hot spring.",
          "Fun place to visit, beautiful scenery and friendly staff, smells horribly like sulfur near the pond and in the cave, so prepare yourself for the odor of earth farts.",
          "It's alright. Just under $4 CAD /person. It's a great thing to see. Depending on the time of year you go, some of the workers are not around for the full experience.",
          "Glad I didn't pay for this. (Used parking pass to get in) Seemed much better and more interesting years ago before they bricked and blocked it all off. But, I guess they have to preserve it somehow!",
          "You should visit the theatre. Very thoughtfull and informative",
          "The sulphur smell is a bit much some times, but if you are a Canada national parks lover, it\u2019s a must see. Great views, lots of history and free admission if you have a discovery pass.",
          "Very nice place for small entrance fee.",
          "Historic site well worth a visit and it's on the no 4 Roam bus route",
          "For the $3 you spend too get in it's definitely worth it.   this place has a decent tail too for hiking but it's very easy to walk and doesn't take very long.   fantastic view though",
          "The cave was a little bit small but it was interesting to learn about the history. It's great to take a short walk through and enjoy the wildlife in the area. Wish that there was more to explore in regards to the cave.",
          "I've been here a few times now, it's always great to bring someone new here. Must see for all the tourist types in the area.",
          "Great value window into history. Around 1 hour of time if you are reading everything!",
          "We were a little unprepared and didnt know that the cave was closed on monday and tuesday, but still it is a nice visit! A nice little walk with info about the origin and process of the basin.",
          "Small but informative museum! It's cool to check out once!",
          "Great park to check out",
          "Nice attraction with treats for kids and adults alike. This is a very informative location with sulfur spring nestled inside and well maintained. Use an annual park pass for free entry if you have it. Staff is very friendly and proactive/helpful.",
          "great for people who love biology and nature. The white algae looks to be from space! make sure you go the outside trail.",
          "Hot springs at great",
          "This is definitely one of the most fascinating historical sites I have ever been to. I learned valuable lessons about conservation, cultural heritage; the disputes that eventually led the Canada's First Prime Minister, John A McDonald to \u2026",
          "Been here many times over the years, alot of information and sights. I cant forget the smells either! Definately stop by if you've never been there before. Very cheap as well, or free with a parks pass.",
          "Beautiful place. Beautiful day.",
          "Cool place to see! Allot of additional things to see for kids, they have so amazing views as well! Just remember unless you have the year long pass it\u2019s $4 something per adult.",
          "Very pretty. And smelly. But worth it, it's a good experience. Canada's first national park, so it's great to have had the experience.",
          "This ended up being more interesting than I anticipated. It's more than the basin it's also a mini museum where you can learn some interesting stuff about the history of the area",
          "Very accessible and informative setup for the place where the national parks system in Canada began. Most of the content isn't about the hot springs/grotto, which is beautiful but can be taken in over a few minutes. Lots of good info and \u2026",
          "Very cool place, but not very big. Make sure you get the dual pass for the hot springs pool - saves some cash and the pool is awesome.",
          "Kids loved it and there was a lot to do. We especially enjoyed the festival activities that were happening at the time.",
          "A good place to learn where the hot springs came from",
          "Nice place to visit",
          "Although a tourist must do whilst in Banff...not a great deal to see here apart from the cave which was very busy and not too interesting. If you've been on any cave tours before this won't be anything new. Exhibits around site are good. Reasonably priced for what it is.",
          "Didn't plan on doing this. So thankful we did.",
          "Great spot to visit and see how Canada\u2019s national parks came to be!",
          "Didn\u2019t even know this place existed. Don\u2019t know why Banff gets all the buzz cause this place is truly the beginnings of our National Parks. I wish they would advertise it more, but I also understand that they need to keep people away to \u2026",
          "This place is a total scam. A tiny cave with terrible smell. Where to get a refund??",
          "Nice walk at anytime of the year.  Free walking paths all around the Cave and Basin exhibit.",
          "If you stay there long enough, you won't feel good.",
          "This place is fun to walk around and read information about the original hot springs. The staff are helpful and there's a neat outdoor area where you can see the hot water come out from the hill. It's also free if you have a pass for the National Parks.",
          "Really worth it, try to catch  a guide tour",
          "This is a really great stop if you're heading to Banff. They've done a wonderful job restoring the old hot springs! Stop by for a tour, or hit some of the walking trails near by!",
          "Pretty neat spot to check out. I really like the history of the park and this is where it all started so that\u2019s a real bonus to learn about that. It\u2019s a real shame that I didn\u2019t visit 100 years ago so I could swim in the pool (they don\u2019t \u2026",
          "Beautiful sceneries and historical site for spring",
          "Great historical site and lots to learn. Loved the art displays. Nice section for kids to enjoy",
          "Cool place to check out with kids.",
          "This is the humble beginning of Canada Parks that was practically a hot spring vacation spot.  There is a multi-media gallery showing its brief history, nicely done though not much depth.  The cave is again like a hot spring pool and was \u2026",
          "We attended a 7pm tour and the staff were lovely albeit slightly inexperienced. It lasted 40 minutes and included a tour of the cave, a video and an opportunity for pictures. More geared to children than adults - get a pint beforehand and prepare for the unmistakeable smell of sulphur.",
          "Cheap to get in. Quite interesting! Smells strongly of sulphur - careful if you have a weak stomach and sensitive nose! Lovely and knowledgable staff.",
          "I love the view from this place. Definitely coming back.",
          "There is a fee to visit and even the attendant didn't seem too excited about it.  There's plenty of parking since not too many visitors and the store has a clean washroom.",
          "Cool little area to visit within the city limits of Banff.  You can blow an hour or so here without too much problem.  Has some nice scientific and historical information.",
          "Nice but not what we expected",
          "Important historic site with some recognition of its significant and sacred history among local Indigenous peoples. Arguably, not enough Indigenous representation in the exhibit narratives with the majority of the focus on the colonial \u2026",
          "The cave and the surroundings has a rotten egg smell due to the sulphur and sometimes it could be very strong but it\u2019s worth visiting.",
          "Such a beautiful and amazing place.",
          "A must visit historic location. Nicely organized.",
          "Bring your annual pass, it's free! \nOr 4$ per adult.\n\nFirst time I smell sulphur and I confirm, it's really like rotten egg. There is only 2 basins, one inside and one outside.\n\nIt's really quiet and the story signs are really interesting.",
          "You have to go there to experience the uniqueness of the cave and basin. Very good information of how the first national park was established in their information guides.",
          "Great place to know where it all started",
          "Great place to learn about the beginning of BANFF National Park. Not expensive and lots of staff to answer your inquiries.",
          "A small historic site worth checking out. It won't take you long, an hour tops. Its only a few bucks (helps preserve the area and pay the staff, so it's worth it) to go in and check out the hot spring in the cave. Just a short walk in, duck \u2026",
          "Very cool! The cave and basin are very small, but very unique. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "Very interesting place, one of the few places where I actually enjoyed reading the informational signs. Definitely would recommend visiting",
          "Amazing like going back in Time",
          "The last place we visited in Banff, but almost the coolest. Totally reminded me of Yellowstone! The cave is quite nice and the \"fort\"/museum is very interesting to explore.",
          "Very interesting experience and discovery of park Canada history",
          "Great spot to spend a rainy day when camping with the kids.  My kids like going here and checking it out.  In the winter they had some fun outdoor activities for the kids as well.  It is small and you could probably wander through it all \u2026",
          "Very nice historical site and museum. Great AV presentation. Fun natural boardwalk interpretive trail. Great rainy day option too.",
          "Nice learning experience",
          "At $7 entry fee I thought the cave and basin was good value for money. We enjoyed reading the history of the area and pools and walking along the walkways. An enjoyable couple of hours.",
          "This is a lovely place. I recommend doing the guided tour. It's free and so good!",
          "Interesting to learn the history of our national parks and historic sites.",
          "Excellent place to visit with family. Very well preserved historical site. But please do not touch the water.",
          "This historic site is very small and smells really bad when you get inside the cave but it looked beautiful especially the water color inside the cave.  We can cover this place in 10 to 15 mins.  Not much to see here but the history is worth reading near the entrance.",
          "Neat place! All I have to say is DO NOT GO HERE IF ITS RAINING. The caves are full of minerals and jeeeez they can stink up a storm, which only seems to be a Big issue when it's raining, I doubt the smell is something they can control. Other than that, this place is really cool!",
          "If you want to experience walking into an arm pit this is the place! Small, smell, humid.",
          "Historical place with a nice museum. It also has a movie which gives insight into the history of the place and how it was rediscovered in the 19th century. Children friendly. Trails, parking, restrooms  all available. Close to the town of Banff. Can spot birds, snakes and animals if lucky.",
          "Wish it was bigger but overall cool place",
          "A nice rainy/snowy-day activity. The cave itself is not very big, but the interpretive centre is pretty interesting",
          "Fun place to take the kids. Lots of activities for them to play with during thier snow festival",
          "Good afternoon trip. But you could noy spend a entire day there, Maybe 2 or 3 h",
          "Great historical little gem.  The interactive tour was very informative and the tour guide was passionate about his job.",
          "Great place to visit at Banff. You have to pay a almost 5 dollar ticket per adult to get into the cave which is not that big, but its beautiful,  just be prepared for the smell that is kind of disgusting by the sulfur. \nIts a 60 minutes active without the trials.",
          "Smelled a little but it was very interesting to see where the Canadian national parks started",
          "Love it. Great history. Spend some time reading and for God's sake stop putting your hands in the water!!! The signs are there.",
          "Nice view \u00e1nd interesting place.",
          "Not bad, but there are much more exciting things in the area. Not expensive, and free if you have a parks pass. Great for a rainy day or a rest day.",
          "It is okay place, there are better caves elsewhere",
          "Absolutely stunning.",
          "4 stars because there was no food or snacks close by. But other than that. Amazing place to see the history of one of Canada's first national parks. The cave is very small takes about 30 seconds to walk into the main cave part. Amazing \u2026",
          "Interesting history.",
          "We loved it here. It's less than $4 to enter. You get to view the \"basin\" inside the cave as well as the pool that thermal water was pumped to. There is also a boardwalk area that leads up to the ground above the cave with lots of history \u2026",
          "This is a great start for people to start discovering the Canadian rockies! Make sure to bring in your annual park pass to get your entrance fee waived. Better to come here in the spring/summer time so you can walk the trails but if winter \u2026",
          "Very interesting place. Worth visiting to learn more about Banff and other national parks and historic sites of Canada. The cave with the hot spring is impressive. There are games for kids in the courtyard, even in winter. Would highly recommend visiting this place.",
          "Beautiful place for relaxing",
          "Cool place to stop. Staff was super helpful and informative.",
          "My husband said it's boring \ud83d\ude05\nbut I still like some of the views there.",
          "Interesting place. Caves with low ceilings, beautiful lights and a small lake with Banff snails. There is a museum dedicated to the closed basins. You can get information on the history of basins and even see the old swimsuits.",
          "We went there cuz we had some hours left in our itinerary and it was a good option. It\u2019s a small place, you can finish the tour in 30-40 minutes, it\u2019s very cheap, and it has some interesting things to see in the history exhibition. People in there is really kind!",
          "I thought there was going to be more of a physical activity center. It is very cheap to attend but the cave take like two minutes to get there. There is a lot of historical info that I wasn't expecting which was nice. You can't go into the water because of the snales that are in the water.",
          "Nothing super special but glad we visited this site.  Interesting to see actual hot springs.",
          "Nice place for a history lesson. Hope everyone is fine with the smell.",
          "Source of hot springs for display as a small museum. There used to be a public hot pool here, which is closed and turned into the meusuem, because it's now required not to touch the hot water here as a way to protect its natural integrity.",
          "So beautiful, but I don't like that they charge money for people to see it. You pay a fee to stay at the park already.",
          "Super super place a lots to walk and see. Smelly because of sulfur",
          "Fascinating experience. Temporary exhibition very esthetic. Walk on the boardwalk very entertaining. A must.",
          "The main cave is a nice attraction, be prepared for some odor. Take some time and enjoy the exhibits and walk the staircase and trail to the upper springs.",
          "While you have to pay to get into most of the area, should you choose not to you can still see lots. Excellent mountain views, a boardwalk path with information boards along the way. You will notice the sulfer smell so not for those with sensitive noses! Look for all the little waterfalls and streams.",
          "Interesting place to visit. Lots of history here. I would prefer to revisit in an off season since its pretty busy in holiday season.",
          "It's really surprised me that the hot spring can be such that clean and beautiful water.\nIt's a beautiful place, I'm not sure is there have the different language to learn about the cave, I didn't saw it, so we actually can't understand the commentary \ud83d\ude05\nBut its beautiful, it worth it!!",
          "I Always like this little museum. Nice staff and quiet place. Nice walking paths. Definitely recommend a stop to learn about Banff and to escape the tourists madness \ud83d\ude09 of down town Banff.",
          "Historic Bath and worth to see. You can never compare it to a modern bath. Its nice and simple but the view is stunning.",
          "Very cool place,  at a very small admission price.",
          "We had a horrible experience of 2 purses being stolen from our vehicle in the parking lot! We were only at the hot springs site for about 1/2 hr. And in that time our car window was smashed and 2 bags with all our important cards, gift \u2026",
          "Not a whole lot to see.  Historical information to read.",
          "If u have visited any orher caves, this one is the smallest.....",
          "Interesting place to visit on the bus line",
          "Beautiful, historical place.",
          "Great place for a beer festival. While waiting in line the park staff entertain you with the local history.",
          "Very commercialized. Not sure if it counts as a cave. But the spring is well preserved and there are snails in these springs which are native to these pools and are not seen anywhere else in the world.",
          "Beautiful place!",
          "A very unique and historic site. An easy walk from parking lot to cave basin. A must visit if you are in Banff.",
          "Excellent attractions right in the city of Banff.",
          "Lifetime experience its was small but worth it. Smell of minerals was very stingy\n Overall very nice place to visit in banff",
          "I love Canada's national parks! It was great seeing the place where the idea all began. Free with an annual parks pass. \n\nBe prepared for the intense sulphur smell! Short walk, made an evening of it by going to the hotsprings afterwards.",
          "Really nice experience, beautiful views. You must visit the cave.",
          "Reasonable cost and easy access",
          "The cave smells really bad but the gift shop is good.  Not particularly great scenery but interesting history.",
          "Interesting place, lots of activities for kids too!",

          "Beautiful views and historical place",
          "Good to know the history of Banff.",
          "The place is located not far from Banff town centre. The highlights are the hot spring and the rare unique snails that live in it.\nThe main hall exhibits Canada attraction places. There is a theatre on 2nd level with scheduled showcase.",
          "Lot of interesting things to learn from here. Don't miss it.",
          "It's a shame it was closed !",
          "Great free hikes with bird blind and views. Lots of great information in French and English about Banff's roots. People are friendly and knowledgeable - ask them about the snails and the smell \nGood for all ages",
          "The Discovery trail was an easy walk for our young family, and had lots information on boards and signs.",
          "Absolutely fascinating place and it's been really well set up. Shame some people don't observe the don't touch rule! Its pretty clear! \nI had seen a sign that said there was somewhere you could touch but after asking a staff memeber he said \u2026",
          "Neat! Like any other national park, this one is well taken care of, has lots of informative signs and exhibits, and is unique in the country. Also has a very strong sulphur smell, which makes it not so ideal for a food and beer festival, which is what brought me there in the first place.",
          "Neat history lesson of the area",
          "Cool place, worth seeing once",
          "Interesting history but the cave is not that spectacular.",
          "was a decent visit. would have gone on to do more hiking instead. some cool historic stuff, but the cave was pretty small. price was very cheap to visit though. easy way to kill an hour. but hiking is more fun!",
          "The cave was magical. The basin and the walk to the source of the spring was beautiful. Great activities for kids. Really informative and helpful staff.",
          "Great historic site! If staying in Banff, walk up rather than taking the bus. It's a great experience.",
          "Sulfur Mountain is where Parks Canada was formed and started. Many of our national parks we're discovered only by Railroad during the late 1800s. There is a strong connection between this mountain park and the native aboriginal people that lived here. You must always remember the sacred connection between this land and its people.",
          "Very interesting to learn about this park! First one in Canada!",
          "I enjoyed walking along the trails and through the museum area. Very interesting to learn a portion of Canada\u2019s history.",

          "Super place. Bonus was seeing a snake giving birth to two babies",
          "Interesting, good oral presentations and animation.",
          "Perk of getting in if you do have a park pass you can get in for free!! Make sure to go for a little hike up the mountains for a nice view and to learn about the mineral waters flowing down the mountains.. . The water kind of stinks.",
          "Well kept, and interesting as history.",
          "Very entertaining and informative!",
          "Amazing place. The cave did smell like rotten egg but it was bearable. The basin looked pretty amazing too. I would definitely come back.",
          "You can smell sulphur as soon you get in. Crystal clear water, beautiful cave to visit once.",

          "After visiting the cave and the film room I was disappointed, there wasn't much content. But after, we found that path that leads to the bassin and the history of the National Park and it was pretty fun. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.",
          "Glad I went once, but I don't know if I'll ever go again. Good histtory on Banff National Park and the Parks system in Canada and some interactive displays, including an interesting and high quality (but short) audio/visual presentation in the hall. The cave is pretty underwhelming.",
          "Good rainy day activity. The board walk and the walk around the building was excellent. It follows the water flow. A lot of mosquitoes",
          "Honestly I thought this was pretty boring:( for the cost and the rush to get there from here we were. I booked the Saturday lantern tour I should mention and it was a let down got the adults and kids. We haven't gone during the day so cant speak on that",
          "Learn about the history of Banff.  They have some new displays and the walk down to the marsh never disappoints.  The warm water from the hot springs flows down the hill along the walk way down to the marsh.  Beautiful!",

          "Was ok, it's not as epic as I thought it would be.",
          "Beautiful cave and sulphur Basin. My partner farted in her once and you can still smell it...",
          "Should have more education on the impact of the indigenous population. The display for the POW and internees was not even in the same building, tucked away outside at the back of the historic site. We should face our dark history, not continually hide from it.",
          "Love place to walk",
          "They say at tourism's office that it's a top 10 place is... A must see but... There is nothing to do there... Really.",
          "I don\u2019t know how this got to be the number one thing you should visit in Banff because it was not at all great. It was a small cave and nothing special, maybe the sulphuric smell but other than that nothing great. For $3 I guess that\u2019s why \u2026",
          "Part of Canada 150\u2019s best I\u2019d say.  Not sure how much I would want to drop on admission when it isn\u2019t free.  Been to the upper hotsprings many times as part of the visit.  It was closed when we were here last so we spent extra time at the museum.",
          "Banff is awesome and this is a great part of  it.",
          "Birthplace of Banff!! Such a good find. The best spot to read about the town of Banff. Cool to see the cave!",

          "Very interesting and adventurous place",
          "Educational, well laid out and inexpensive to visit! Nice boardwalk hike.",
          "Cool for the history, and neat exhibits, but certainly were much cooler back when the public could swim in them",
          "We went to the Banff craft beer festival here and had a great time",
          "Nice and educational if you already have a paid park pass. A word of warning for people that can't stand the smell of rotten eggs...the Sulphur around there give out these nice aroma :) Also a bit disappointed that the cave is not bigger or more caves to explore.",
          "Cant believe I've been to Banff so many times and never visited here.  Well worth a visit, even if it's just to walk the boardwalk.",
          "A great place to learn about the formation of parks  canada. Very informative both pannels and interpreters. The cave and basin did a good job representing the first nation people.",
          "Great history and fun for all ages",
          "First National park of Canada",
          "Very interesting.   We have been going to Banff for years but this was our first visit to the Cave a d Basin.  My first thought upon entering the Cave was of those boys who had been lost in the Cave in Thailand.   I can only imagine how terrifying it would be.",
          "I thought the short interpretive trail was interesting and would keep your average kid interested.",
          "Staff are so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Lots of beautiful and well maintained trails in addition to the main cave and historical points.",
          "It's a small pool, but with the story behind it.",
          "Interesting place, and reasonably priced. A nice walk from town.",
          "Interesting bit of history.  Easily accessible.  Worth the visit.  There is admission.",
          "You can really smell the sulphur here, but great to learn the history and a wonderful centre.",
          "Cheap admission, the cave and basin are pretty cool. The story boards about how the cave was \"discovered\" are also quite interesting.",
          "Great area to walk around  lots of good info",
          "Pretty cool how the hot springs are in a cave. The full tour is pretty quick. 30 minutes max.",
          "Waste of 45 minutes of my life",
          "Great walk",
          "Enjoyed the cave",
          "A lot to do but some activities can be missed if you don't look very hard. Can't beat the cost!",
          "Surprisingly great place to visit. Learned a lot!",
          "The front lady was very rude. Overall experience was ok, a little under expectation. We thought the cave was gonna be bigger.",
          "Was expecting a bit more from Cave and Basin. The cave was truely beautiful but there is limited activities or sites at the location.\n\nIf you have a Parks Pass, you can use it to pay for admission",
          "Neat place, nice trails low cost",
          "Pretty neat. This is more a museum and information centre. You do NOT swim here. There's a beautiful walking path behind the building, don't miss it.",

          "Not much to see in winter.",
          "The cave was alot smaller than expected, but over all was pretty cool! Lots of places to check out, including museum, cave area, basin, bird watch and fish watching areas and lots of paths and walk ways! If you are looking for a free, fun, and educational place to go... this is it!",
          "Got free entry with my Parks Canada annual pass. Intersting place with the hot springs and snails.....",

        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

          "This place is loaded with history and how life was in Banff. It is receomended to go with someone who has never been. Just watch how many times they smile - this place is a treasure!",
          "Whyte museum is very charming with historical photographs and artifacts of the history of the area. THere was also a special exhibit on horses with some wonderful paintings and sculptures. Convenient located in town, Whyte also has lockers / closet to put your coats and",
          "Very interesting museum about two artists in Banff as well as First Nations, women and some war heroes. Staff were excellent. Great activity for a wet, snowy day",
          "The combination of art - mix of pictorial and impressionist, I suppose - and especially the museum, with the history of the railroads, and the arrival of settlers, inter-action with First Nations, and arrival of Chinese and East European workers, is told very well and with",
          "My husband and I wanted to visit this museum with our 8 month year old son in a stroller. The rude lady in the gift shop said strollers aren\u2019t allowed in the museum. Ok, sure, maybe the museum has super narrow paths or it\u2019s really crowded? So my husband went in alone, while",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Full of educational information. Learned a lot. Gift shop is nice. Was able to see what we wanted in a little over an hour. A small museum but worth stopping by and learning about the area and it's development. Highly recommend.",
          "Great museum containing artwork and artifacts. Cool movies to watch. Nice to spend a few hours exploring.",
          "Banff is basically an outdoor place (see picture), but this is one of the best indoor attractions for those interested in the history or wanted to shelter from the rain. It's an eclectic mix of art, first nations artefacts and the coming of the Europeans and their development of",
          "Lots of history and beautiful artwork...tied alot of the area together. We enjoyed our visit and the diverse artworks",
          "Small but mighty. Lots of interesting items to see, and read about. We followed a tour guide around, he mentioned many interesting facts bout various items. Recommend ya give it a visit.",
          "Having spent days zooming from one amazing natural sight to another, for some reason we decided to slow down and take in this museum, and we are so glad we did. The Whytes weren't just patrons, they were extremely talented artists who for decades painted Banff, the Rockies and",
          "I actually went twice -- there was so much to see! I really enjoyed the docent-led tour, because it highlighted some key aspects I might have overlooked on my own. Great bookstore and gift shop, too!",
          "The Whyte Museum is small but packed with interesting information. Well organized so that nothing is missed. It is inexpensive and you could get a discounted rate with CAA membership. Be sure to watch the video at the end. It is worth the trip.",
          "Recommend stopping by the museum. Lots of great history, clean and well organized. Will take you about an hour to go through.",
          "Complements the Buffalo Museum across the river as this majors in recent history and incomers, while the Buffalo is strong on indigenous native people. Very well displayed and good for all ages. The little video of the bear trying to get into the garbage container is brilliant.",
          "Great Museum well recommended and lots of things to see because it is great and good and I would come back.",
          "We started out at this museum for a town walk. Our guide was great and we saw some unusual spots. But the museum, itself, was very worthwhile. Both the Whytes were artists and there's an exhibit that contains work from them both and from their collection. Nice!",
          "We were fortunate to begin our visit with a guided tour. He was knowledgeable and witty and had many interesting insights about the history of the Canadian Rockies and the amazing Whyte family. A great way to learn about the area and see some beautiful art at the same time.",
          "I was very interested in the pictures, particularly as I was trying to work out my own approach to painting the mountains. The Whytes knew how to do it! Then visiting the local art galleries gave other perspectives. Insights into the local history combined well with the Cave",

A few short videos could be run to see actual footage of some folks here in the late 1800\u2019s to 1950\u2019s, a model T and helicopter are on view. It\u2019s a decent collection of",
          "There is a wealth of information in this museum, giving a unique look at the history of European settlement in the area (with some First Nations perspective). The Whyte's art collection also has some breadth. Tour the homes with a guide to get another peek at early Banff life.",
          "The museum itself is an amazing space. The exhibitions change but the static collection is fascinating. At the time of our visit there was a big collection of the Whyte's own works which were delightful. It's a shame we were not able to visit one of the little houses in the",

          "We spent an afternoon in Banff proper shopping, eating and visited the Whyte musuem. Very interesting museum with lots of insight into this beautiful Park. Included art, history, and technology. Spent about 2 hours. Great value and nice gift shop too!",
          "These folks may want to get input from a professional museum curator. Some great pieces, but overall disappointing. It seems more about the two founders and less about the area/people/culture they loved. For example: there is a massive room dedicated almost exclusively to art",
          "Well worth the visit. Great history and informative tour. Nicely done inside. Wonderful artifacts and local history.",
          "It was nice to take a break from the present and go back in time. There were plenty of photos and artifacts of the early days of setlements and surveying. We learned about the namesake of Peyto Lake, for example. We spent about one hour at this museum.",
          "We spent 2 hours at the museum but could have stayed longer, it was so interesting. It gave a real insite into Banff history and how the town was formed. Along with the histore of the railway and indiginous people.",
          "I had to change the date of our visit. No problem!! Viator helped, I talked directly to the museum person! No Problem! But when we showed up Monday, they were closed! And we leave Tuesday morning early. Lost money on that one! And even worse? I am an anatomist and really",

          "We really enjoyed this museum and bought the combined ticket for the Buffalo nations museum, which at a discounted rate for seniors was good value. The art collection of Peter and .Catharine Whyte plus their wider collection is a real treasure and we were interested in the",
          "Not only covering Peter and Catharine Whyte\u2019s art it also covers history of the Rockies. Patrick showed us around \u201cGateway to the Rockies tour\u201d he was very knowledgable and engaging and certainly enhanced the visit.",
          "We visited the museum expecting a lot more historical displays. There is a large room which we went through in 10 minutes. There was much more art displays than history. Maybe we missed something. We enjoyed the Buffalo nations musuem much more. You can get a combined ticket",
          "An excellent presentation of the history of the Whyte family and the local region. We could have spent more time than we had allowed unfortunately. Recommended.",
          "Cute little museum. Has a variety of little things to do with the Rockies and its history. The lady at the admissions desk was polite and efficient. She tried to upsell us to a package with another museum but we decided to forego that. She was very nice and informed us that my",
          "We are currently traveling through the West of Canada. We stayed two days in Banff. On the second day we decided to visit the Whyte Museum. The museum provides a nice mix of historic information and modern art. We are visiting art museums around the world. We liked it a lot. We",
          "We only visited because we had free tickets and it was a cloudy day. Waste of time. Who wants to spend a day inside a museum when you are in Banff?!",
          "This small museum provides a great history of the Banff region and has many interactive exhibits. If you are looking for a break from the outdoors (not that you need one!) this is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.",
          "Nice facilities with some good history but, not overly exciting as I expected. Some interested things and nice little gift shop.",
          "Wonderful indoor activity. Fun artifacts and look at early mountaineering life. It was fun to see the alpine helicopter that looked like a tin can. Yikes!",
          "We squeezed this into a recent trip to Banff jsut as we were leaving and were glad we did. The space is lovely, the museum fascinating and the art collection, compring works by the Whytes and lots of other things, very intersting. Put the town of Banff into context and added",
          "Both the Whytes worked with the native Americans and were adopted as Honary members of the tribe so had a facinating insight into the tribes. However it had the air of being very worthy and a little dull although very informative. Both are highly regarded artists and there was",
          "The Whyte Museum is a wonderful way to learn about the history of Banff, alpine exploration and the women & men who opened it up for the rest of us. A beautiful building filled with great art and lovely stories.",
          "This museum details the history of the Canadian Railroad with artifacts, interactive exhibits, actual models, writings, diaries and other attractions. The museum is not huge and you can probably tour it in under 3 or 4 hours. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it as a",
          "This is a must view place if you like history. Incredible images captured generations ago in the pristine Rocky mountains.",
          "Spent a nice hour wandering around this local museum which is well loved and looked after. There isn\u2019t too much here, but enough to give a flavour of the history of the area.",
          "Has always been a favorite. They change the exhibits so its not always the same thing over and over. The history of the area is a constant but i still enjoy the trip back through time every time I go.",
          "I guess we were expecting more from a \"Museum\" this was of the family who settled here and the History of how they lived in the town of Banff. Interesting art on the walls and a small replica of Indian lore and the Swiss who came to host the ice tours. Informative, yes, just not",
          "Went to get out of the cold. Renovations were in progress so I got in half priced. The location is great with near free parking. I enjoyed the design of the small facility and exhibits. This is a nicety to check into as you may be strolling by.",
          "Spent a very interesting few hours wandering around this museum. It showed what life was like in the early days and had displays of First Nation dress and artifacts as well as a small gallery of paintings.",
          "The Whyte Museum is an excellent backgrounder, providing arts and insights into what makes Banff such a special place. Best of all, it is a quiet respite from all the shopping tourist hordes downtown. The current display of art work by the husband-and-wife Whytes, plus some of",
          "This was a joy to see, with very interesting history of the area and how talented people made the area what it is. The art collection was very good and does much to reflect the artist's skills. Museum is big enough to provide a deep insight into the tourist area it has become.",
          "Nice small museum covering the local and Rockies - Canadian Pacific, Indigenous Peoples, characters, hotels etc. Well displayed. Nice artwork and historical artifacts. Nice place to spend a pleasant couple of hours on a rainy day.",
          "Peter and Catharine Whyte are an integral part of the history of Banff and have contributed their paintings as the foundation of the Whyte Museum. Various special exhibits support the exploration of the art of the Rockies. The historical section offers information on First",
          "The paintings are really worth seeing as are the many and varied exhibits on First Nations, exploration, wildlife and life in the Rockies. The cabins outside the museum are evocative of how it was a century ago.",
          "What we liked about this museum was it was small and intensely personal . We felt we knew Peter and Kathy Whyte when we left . The art displayed is not only excellent but all painted in the area and great explanations of the expeditions the artists went on as they undertook",
          "Came across the Whyte Museum by chance when walking about the town of Banff and decided to give it a try. An absolutely outstanding regional art museum. The 100 Heads: Childhood Memories of Banff Personalities was fascinating and provided great insight into the town's culture.",
          "We didn't have long to visit but what we did see was informative and extremely interesting. We didn't have time to see the historic cabins which would have been an extra highlight.",
          "The Whyte museum portray the arts and cultural heritage of the Canadian Rockies in particular the Banff area. This is only a moderate sized building but has a good range of paintings and artefacts. As well as a Heritage Gallery containing First Nations and early settlers",
          "Mrs. Whyte was from Concord, Massachusetts! Great place to trace Banff history by exhibit and description. Comfortable walk from downtown.",
          "We enjoyed this museum, the paintings are beautifull. Most about the nature in the area. In the other part there was a nice exhibition of the historie. Nice to are and read.",
          "Although there was a dedicated exhibition based on the works of the founders the other part interested me more. The exhibits and videos were fascinating and gave you a real insight into how the town and surrounding areas developed from the late 19th century through to modern",
          "We enjoyed the art exhibit and the guided tour. The tour guide did an excellent job of relating the history of the area and the artists whom the museum is named after. It's also nice that you can purchase admission to two museums at once. So we also enjoyed a visit to the",
          "The museum has a wonderful collection of paintings by the local artists who depicted the town in the early to mid 20th century, with beautiful landscapes and portraits. I was really impressed. In another room, there is a large exhibit of historical items related to the Whyte",
          "Fantastic art and history museum full of great exhibits, artifacts and photographs. This is one of the best museums we visited. They partner with a museum of First Nations' people, so you can buy a discounted pass to both. Impressive and informative!",
          "I like museums and this one was mentioned in a lot of literature that I saw while researching our stay in Banff. It was in the top ten thing to do on many sites. I found it to be limited and boring. There is a modest fee to pay for admission but even that small amount left me",
          "If you do this museum first there is a combo pass to also go to the Buffalo Nations Museum. You save a few dollars and both are worth seeing! The Whyte Museum has both art and historical information of the area. There are several areas that kids can interact and touch",
          "We visited the museum on the last day before our departure from the city and love it. Both guided tour were exceptional and we strongly recommend it!",
          "On a smokey day in August when we couldn't enjoy the outdoor activities for the poor air quality, our sibling group enjoyed the Whyte Museum. More art gallery than historical museum...but both were interesting. There is a public parking lot nearby as well as srreet parking.",
          "Very interesting site with excellent information, art, museum pieces. Touring the 2 houses is worth the time. Nice gift shop.",
          "They had me when I walked in the door. This houses some of the best artwork in the Rockies. Great gift shop. We love painting the sidewalk for canada day",
          "The museum was really interesting. If you take a guided tour, you get to learn about the sharing relationship of the Whytes and Native tribes from Banff.",
          "This was open on Sunday morning which was useful. You need a good couple of hours to see all the museum and the out buildings this is more about the first settlers and the journey and hardship they had.",
          "Beautiful collection of work with geographic significance. A great way for tourists to connect with the area! Excellent staff ready to go well out of their way to be of assistance.",
          "Stopped here as part of a Tauck Tour. Very interesting place. The founders of the museum, Peter Whyte and Catherine Robb Whyte were both artists, and there is a lot of their work on display, including an entire room of sculpted heads done by Catherine. This museum has a good",
          "One room of the museum is devoted to the paintings of Whyte. They are quite nice but, for me, the best part was the exhibits of how the Canadian Rockies were first explored and exploited. The college-aged docent was particularly wonderful, answering my endless questions with",
          "This museum consists of various animals that are found in the park. The museum is about a hundred years old and many of the specimens mounted date back to then. Various collectibles from the park as well. Worth seeing just for the building alone. Good for an hour or two, not",
          "Popped in here after a hike as wanted to kill an hour or so. A fabulous find and wished I had more time. The art gallery exhibition was paintings by the founders of the museum and their contempories. Alongside this exhibitions about the building of the railway and beginnings of",
          "Went to see what Banff routes were, bought the extra add on to see the heritage houses. Lovely little museum and guided tour of Heritage housed well woth it.",
          "Great place to learn about the history of many chapters in the life of Banff: railroad, skiing and more. Well-planned exhibits. Look for special educational talks in the evening.",
          "Well displayed museum. We went on the house tour also. Both gals giving presentations were very clear to understand and professional. Nice gift store also. They also have a place to put backpacks and coats (lockers) no extra charge. Good activity if the weather is not great.",
          "We spent an hour, this past Sunday, at this museum. Kids admission was free and $10 each for the adults (I see it more as a donation, rather then admission) We had fun sitting in the helicopter and the old car. Lots of history and artifacts to explore within this building. We",
          "We were recommended to visit this museum and as we had a rainy afternoon we decided to visit and were glad we did. Very interesting and informative exhibits about the history of the area.",
          "Good pieces by the Whytes, although I am a bit jaded having seen a lot of art museums around the world. I prefer Catherune Robb Whyte's work. Notably her life drawings and portraits. My favorite piece was a large portait of her by another artist around 1925. Lovely. The local",
          "Yes, there is beautiful artwork throughout the museum. But even more, important to a tourist, it explores through art the history of the area. Gateway to the Rockies, is an ongoing and changing exhibit. Looking through their brochure the museum has special exhibits throughout",
          "Great place to get the history of the area and the national park as a whole. Makes you realise how hardy the early explorer were.",
          "This gave the history of Banff, which was very interesting. It had artifacts from explorations on display. They do give a AAA discount, so take your card with you.",
          "Well worth visiting when you are in Banff. This is a very nicely put together museum that I have visited several times over the years and try to get back to when I am in Banff.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum which is packed with interesting stories and artefacts about Banff history including information about locals Rob and Catherine Whyte who established the museum and had a good relationship with a local First Nations tribe. Very well laid out and",
          "We were given passes to the Whyte Museum, so took it in when walking around Banff. A beautiful small modern museum which you can give justice to in 1-2 hours. The exhibits give you a real sense as to the history and development of this area of the Canadian Rockies and what",
          "Amazing museum to gain a better understanding of How Banff became what it is today. Really cool and interactive",
          "There's a huge room of black and white photographs, then several other rooms all full of interesting things. Everything from a car to a helicopter, national costumes, books etc. We spent ages here and loved every minute. Well worth a visit.",
          "There is much to see in this museum, what struck me most were the personal accounts of locals who fought in WWI and WWII. I am glad I did not miss this stop.",
          "This is not a major gallery so it doesn't require at big time commitment but it's well worth the hour or so to pass through. The photo gallery is interesting, but a little repetitive, but the exhibits are fun for families. We combined this with a day in town (the mountains were",
          "We were in Banff recently, and noticed that they had a great photography exhibit related to the region's photography festival \"Exposure.\" Indeed, there were two different shows in their big hall. But they do make small changes to the history exhibit every year, and we like",
          "My husband and I were interested in taking some time to learn about the history of the area, the wildlife, and see some local art work. This privately owned museum is the perfect size to hit it all up in an hour or so. There are some engaging exhibits for kids to do, like hop",
          "This museum is very impressive and captures the essence of the region's history from the settlers to the local communities. Definitely plan more than an hour for this. The entrance is $10 and well worth it",
          "Always good to check out a little local history if you have time to spare. Great littlre local museum, spend and hour or two and learn something you didn't know about the Canadian Rockies",
          "This museum is quite small but has some excellent photos dating back over a century and also artefacts to view. It's great to see Banff how it used to be before development.",
          "The Art Gallery was interesting - enjoyed the Grisly Bear display of the tagged bears in the park and their family tree. The historical displays were very well done and we enjoyed the history that is shared here.",
          "I had known of this artist - interesting museum - takes only about and hour or hour and a 1/2 to see it all I had hoped to see more of the original paintings Nice visit",
          "Full of interesting artifacts and information about the Rockies. Nice place to visit. I would recommend spending an hour there as you will see it all in that time.",
          "The Whyte Museum does an amazing job of relating the history of Banff National Park and Canadian mountaineering. These permanent exhibits are a combination of historical artifacts, story boards and interactive displays. While the museum space is small, the displays are very well",
          "This museum has a lot of art from the Whyte family along with some interesting information on the history of the area.",
          "Visited here with no great expectation as had no previous knowledge of the museum. Was pleasantly surprised as it was fairly informative. Think I would have enjoyed more if I had an interest in Art (by Peter Whyte), but enjoyed for an hour nevertheless.",
          "This is a very well designed and attractive building with several different galleries and a comprehensive view of the development of the area and of a distinctive Canadian national identity. There are many authentic artefacts, the stories behind them and a wealth of photographs.",
          "Well worth a visit and not too expensive or hard work! Very interesting displays of all sorts of things as well as paintings. Centrally located",
          "This is such a great little museum. Full of very interesting history. Well laid out and very well maintained and staffed.",
          "This is an interesting collection which tells the story of the growth of Banff, the development of the railroad and so on. It shows archive footage of historical events in one room. we found it quite informative. However, I preferred the Buffalo nations museum over this one",
          "This exceptional museum tells the history of the Canadian Rockies and the Banff area. I was particularly interested in the story of nearby Castle Mountain, which had been temporarily renamed in honor of General Dwight Eisenhower. A staff person in the archives department was",
          "We visited this museum after buying a joint ticket at the Buffalo Nations Museum, but to be honest its only really worth doing the later.",
          "grey day with smoke shrouding the mountains so a museum visit was called for, and what a pleasant surprise for us. The collection is very relevant to the growth of .Banff as a tourist town without forgetting the First Nations and their contributions to the area. There were some",
          "We were looking for something to do when it was raining, and visited the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies for a quick summary of Banff's human history. The museum is in a nice building, and bridges the 10,000-year gulf between those who hunted huge Pleistocene mountain sheep",
          "This museum was a recommendation by the staff of Melissa's as something to do after lunch. A very good recommendation. Lots of interesting exhibits to look at typicalof the area.",
          "Nice well maintained and documented history of how Banff developed after it was found and its growth after the train came through.",
          "Time-machine yourself back into history. This extensive museum has something for everyone: the first nations, explorers, adventurers, women pioneers, and too much to digest for just one visit. Children will love this place. Adults too. In fact, the entire family will enjoy. In",
          "Mom travelled here to visit while we skid - it was a good way to learn about the culture and history of this area.",
          "Carefully curated museum and gallery with interesting local artefacts and stories . We spent an hour or so looking round - A good way to understand the cultural back story of the Rockies.",
          "The museum is a little weak and not worth the $10 fee, but what was even more disappointing was our experience with the personnel in the archives area. We were searching for some information on one of the founding artists and they were very unhelpful, couldn't be bothered and",
          "There's a lot of historical information in this small museum about Banff life in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It's a great place for non-locals, such as myself, who are not familiar with that aspect of the area. We took a guided tour of the two homes of founding",
          "Came in after a hike nearby. The service desk was pleasant and it was a nice way to unwind and learn a bit more history about the place. Wish it was larger!",
          "Elegant constructed museum with two main galleries, one for local art and photography, and one for pioneer artifacts and native culture. I especially liked the old photo prints depicting the virgin state of the Rockies and man's earliest efforts to put Banff and the Rockies on",
          "The permanent art collection was very interesting, and the exhibits of the early history of the area was fascinating. The exhibits are beautifully arranged and the flow through the rooms is natural and engaging. The gift shop was a real treat as well, with a good deal of",
          "My wife and I are museum \"freaks\", in that we enjoy frequenting them. We found that there was much to see and learn from this place. By all means take the various docent tours to get a fuller and more broader picture of the growth and development of Banff. We were permitted",
          "This museum is full of history of the early settlers and frontier explorers. Makes you appreciate what they went through to settle in the Canadian Rockies...Very well done.",
          "Only a small amount of the total collections can be displayed but a very clear and well presented introduction to the history and culture of the Rockies. An insight too into the work and life of the little known (at least in the UK) founders and their artistic achievements.",
          "We visited this museum at the end of our trip and greatly enjoyed seeing pictures of places we had visited. Information about Mary Schaeffer and other Mountain Exploring Wome was very interesting. I really enjoyed the items available in the gift shop..",
          "We took 3 (20) minute each docent tours lead by Iris to explain (1) the art, (2) mountain life and (3) to tour 2 of the homes of key early settlers. She was able to quickly explain and summarize the information to help me better understand how people lived here for the past 150",
          "This museum often has great exhibitions on. There are permanent exhibits and rotating ones too. They often feature well know photographers too.",
          "This is a neat little museum to check out. Admission was $10 per adult and they provide free lockers as backpacks are not allowed in. A couple of museum staff were always on hand and even helped take a couple of pictures. It's not a high volume museum so you can view/read at",
          "Part art museum and part history of the mountains surrounding Banff. Many displays have sound to assist in understanding what you are seeing. Worth the price of admission.",
          "Focused on local history and the characters through time that have played a role in creating the town. There is something for everybody like the story of Bill Peyto and the Brewster family. Well worth a visit if you have time.",
          "I liked the Whyte's paintings and enjoyed the small town ambience of the museum. It is small local and friendly with is just what you'd want really. Informative of area.",
          "The Whyte is a fun 45-minute visit. The collection consists mostly of plein air landscapes which are fantastic and other works of local artists. There is a small historic section about the Canadian Pacific Railway and the contributions made by local businessmen. Some attention",
          "Good place to spend an hour or 2. Informative about the history of Banff and area. Some interesting artifacts from the past.",
          "Attractive small local museum. Very limited content. Not for kids. Friendly staff. Not worth it.What they have is nice, but don't have much content. Nice gift shop.",
          "On a rainy day in Banff, we stepped into this Museum, which was created by Peter and Catherine Whyte. It holds their collection of art, artifacts, stories and photographs. They came from Boston and made Banff their home. Wonderful story. One of the best gift shops we visited",
          "This is a local museum that contains much local history. The exhibits feature the history of climbing and skiing in the local mountains. This is a mountain town. There is not a lot of parking on site but lots in close proximity. Entrance fees are low and the venue is wheel",
          "This museum is a little gem and well worth a visit, it gives a good insight into the town and the surrounding area.",
          "This museum offers 10% discount to BCAA/CAA members. I don't think it is advertised, so just ask when you pay. Remember to bring your BCAA/CAA membership card. I really like the helicopter exhibit - a good spot for photos.",
          "We stopped in here because it was snowing and we didn't have much else to do and we are so glad that we did. The admission fee is very reasonable and the museum is very nice. There is a lot of information here, if you take the time..which we did. The staff were very friendly",
          "Not the most exciting place but worth a visit for the mass of exhibits and lots of info. Buy a joint ticket with their partner museum (Buffalo Nations Museum) to save money",
          "The Whyte museum had been recommended to us and it certainly didn't disappoint. Lots of interesting Artifacts & information on the history of Banff, as well as, pieces of Art. Whilst we where there, there was an exhibition on, called - across the great divide, Fantastic",
          "You could spend an hour or three hours here. Lots of great info and short movie clips. Good public loos, somewhere to put backpacks in lock ups for easy of walking around, on the edge of town. A must go if you are there.",
          "A very worthwhile visit. Provided a good historical context of Banff and included how folks interacted with Natives. A Helicopter on display that was used for early Helicopter skiing was a scary machine!",
          "We stopped in here during a couple of days in Banff and found it to be an excellently put together museum giving real insight into life in Banff and the Rockies. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Easy to find in central Banff and a good collection of artefacts and stories. Very helpful staff, although the gift shop was very expensive and had very few \"made in Canada\" items for sale. You can get a 2 for 1 deal with the buffalo nation museum down the road a bit.",
          "Great museum. Very interesting and informative permanent exhibits and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. If you are taking a day off skiing or just hanging out in town, make sure you visit and allow yourself at least 2 hours to wander through the exhibits. You",
          "Covers the history and culture of the region. Excellent special exhibitions. Very interesting programs. Library and archives maintained and on site.",
          "Not very interesting or well done. We have visited across the world and this is not interactive or interesting in comparison.",
          "We wandered around for about an hour. I think if we had gone without our two little kids (age 3 and 5) we might have gotten more out of it. There wasn't much for the kids to do, or rather, not much they were interested in, other than the car and helicopter. We enjoyed the",
          "Went there for a visit and must say we were extremely disappointed. The had an art exhibit which to say the least was shocking and inappropriate. Was not worth the admission price.",
          "Always a pleasure to visit the Whyte Museum. You receive a lively welcome and the museum gives a fabulous snapshot of life in the Rockies over the ages.",
          "Hubby & I wandered in here & really enjoyed our visit. It's a small museum that one can get through in an hour or two, but there's lots to see & especially a lot of art & displays related to the Canadian Rockies. I liked sitting in a helicopter & old car & watching a",
          "This neat little museum helped us understand the history of Banff and surrounds and famous people critical to its popularity and development. It's a neat thing to bring kids under 8.",
          "We visited this small museum in March. It was very quiet. We enjoyed most of the exhibits - especially the old heli-ski exhibit. The museum also had an art gallery. One of the exhibits was quite dark and showed the dark side of Canadian history. It was educational although",
          "We have been here a few times and most exhibits are great. However the one titled O Canada ( I'm sorry) Was horrible . If you have kids it may be offensive so I wouldn't take them through it I usually look at exhibits with an open mind but this one is messed up Which is what I",
          "Thought provoking, the art exhibits were great. It was a look into the past of the early explorers into the Rockies.",
          "The Whyte Museum is perhaps too modest in its marketing. This is a very high quality local museum in a lovely modern building that reflects its surroundings. Well-designed exhibits introduced us to the extraordinary people and events that carved the Town and the National Park",
          "We were greeted by a friendly lady at the desk and she gave us a great rundown on the museum and its facilities. Exhibits were interesting and well laid out. All AV components were working properly. Fascinating exhibit showing the early days of helicopter skiing.",
          "Great museum that has showcased the history and life in the area around Banff. Really gave us a flavor for what went into preserving the beauty of the town. You have to take the time to watch the videos and read a lot of the displays - but excellent variety of all aspects of",
          "The Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies is a beautiful facility housing a comprehensive history of the Park and the people that created it. There is an art gallery space with modern exhibits (included with admission), several heritage houses behind the main building",
          "One of my favorite things to do while traveling is to visit museums in any given city. I was surprised by the quality and vibe of the Whyte Museum in Banff. I say surprised because it felt like a big city facility but Banff is small. As with Cave and Basin, it provides",
          "Currently the Whyte is celebrating photography, and the three shows in the galleries could not showcase that medium better. It's hard to believe that a small museum like this can support a fantastic student photography program in the surrounding area, but it does and the images",
          "Really enjoyable attraction that told so many great stories about the Rockies and the people of Banff. Art exhibition was enjoyable but the highlight was the displays that told the history of the Canadian Rockies, both indigenous and pioneering. Memorable highlight was the",
          "We go every year. Always a nice art collection, and historical artifacts from around Banff. Go on the Heritage Homes tours (they are out on the grounds). Nice insights into early days of Banff.",
          "I've been honoured to be part of several events here and this place is the epicentre of Banff history. A must see!",
          "This museum has lots of interesting displays about the history of the area. The main feature is the gallery though where you can find excellent art exhibits any time of the year. Come back often. There is a new exhibit every couple of months in one of the 3 or so galleries",
          "We spent an hour wandering around the museum. The staff was friendly and we were glad we stopped here. The museum isn't huge but just the right size for a short visit.",
          "We had a day trip to Banff and it was absolutely miserable. It was snowing which was nice, but windy and cloudy, so just yuck! We had planned on doing the gondola, but as the conditions didn't favour this, we had to change plans. We decided on the museum after being recommended",
          "I had expectations of exploring more in-depth history and early life in the Rockies/Banff area. I felt the exhibits just touched on certain elements and could have been more developed. There was certainly more space available to take this museum to a different level.",
          "A good overview of the history of the Rockies including some of the major players. It is not large, nor is it terribly child friendly. Older children will enjoy it however. One half is a large art gallery, the other a concise and interesting look at Banff's history. You get a",
          "Our expectations of local museums are never very high due to their tight budgets, but the Whyte Museum has now changed all that. What a great place to visit! Being a land surveyor, I was very interested in their extensive display 'Surveying the Summits'. i would have liked to",
          "Visiting the whyte museum wase an unexpected pleasure. It was like stepping back in time, focusing on what life was like in and around Banff during the 1800'summer and into the mid 1900'September, and focusing on Peter and Catherine Whyte, prolific artists, abd fascinating",
          "We received free tickets from our hotel and decided to check it out. It was very interesting showing some of the history of the area and showcasing local artists.",
          "The museum gives an interesting view at how the early mountaineers climbed and eventually settled the area. It also catalogues the railway coming through and more modern mountaineering travellers on the rockies. Good for a day when the weather isn't so favourable.",
          "We visited on a drizzly Tues. on 20 Sept. and parked just one block away in the free multi-story garage on Bear St. by it\u2019s junction with Lynx. If you enjoy hiking, this museum has a lot to offer regarding the historic development of the Canadian Rockies. We enjoyed seeing how",
          "Banff has an abundance of riches in the museum field: the Whyte Museum, and the Park Museum. Both are highly recommended, but only the Whyte stays open year-round. The Whyte combines museum, gallery, and archives. There is definitely enough material here to keep you engaged for",
          "A mix of local history and art. Well laid-out, you'll need 1-2 hours. Use AAA card and save. Walking distance from center of town.",
          "Loved the Museum and the adjoining home of the Whytes. It was marvelous to see their collections and home. We just loved how it was presented and the docent was terrific.",
          "Informative about the Whyte family and how they ensured the area was mapped. photographed, painted and relationship maintained with the first nations. 'Average' is a harsh summary but 'very good' would be too much ... unless you have a connection. Museum was excellently laid",
          "It was interesting but nothing special. The outside exhibits were the best part in my opinion. May be good filler for a bad weather day.",
          "This was the first museum we visited in Banff, excellent. Quite a variety of items, beautiful paintings, even a full size helicopter. Also a good shop for those items to remind you of a great holiday.",
          "This was a great way to appreciate the history of Banff, with many exhibits related to the first nations. On the day we were there the museum sponsored a free native dance exhibition, which was outstanding! Other exhibits included fine art, natural history and a great gift shop.",
          "We were a little disappointed in the museum, maybe some of the galleries were closed when we visited, as a number of galleries were displaying artworks. The museum provides the history of the Rockies and the building of the train line. I think it could have had more information",
          "This museum is not too large and has a good variety of exhibits incluaing paintings and temporary exhinbitions",
          "Good experience an excellent insight into the beginnings of tourism for the Rockies. Hans on exhibits plus video and film footage",
          "This artfully designed museum tells the story of few tough men who discovered a natural gem that turned out to be the base for a lovely town in a fantastic region. The artifacts and depicted scenes are really very well presented and interesting and after the visit one",
          "This museum is just the right size and is really interesting. Lots of interesting exhibits to look at and opportunities to interact. We went one afternoon after a lovely walk in the morning. I was a bit sceptical as thought I don't want to be inside when there is so much",
          "fantastic museum depicting the history of banff a must see and only $10 took me an hour to go around..",
          "The Whyte Museum is a must see. The story of Catherine and Phillip Whyte, their love affair with the CR and their own lives together are extremely interesting. Their paintings, photos, and display of climbing devices, survey equipment, clothing, etc. is a real trip back to the",
          "Well worth the admission price. Lots of interesting information about the Whytes and their art and life in Banff. Beautiful paintings and art",
          "A fantastic museum started by the Whyte family. Beautifully designed and packed with historical artefacts - First Nations, climbing and hiking, the 2 World wars and paintings. Some fabulous AV displays showing life in Banff in the 50's and a good museum shop.",
          "Not really much to see here. The partial helicopter is about the only interesting exhibit. A few beaded indian clothes, several drawings by Mr Whyte, but nothing special. It's a good rainy day place to go. Banff is proud of this museum, but the $9.00 admission is really more",
          "We toured here to learn about Banff. Lots of interesting tidbits of history....be sure to watch the video of the development of Banff.",
          "We were surprised at just how interesting this museum is. Well presented and with a host of fascinating exhibits giving the history of the Rockies. We spent hours there when we only intended to spend an hour or two.",
          "The Whyte Museum is just off the main street in Banff, and really worth the visit. There's an incredible amount of history contained within the building - from the origin of the resorts in the rockies to the expansion of the railway. Well worth the admission.",
          "This museum had technology of the past and present, Explorers tools were preserved as well as tea vessels and boxes to carry them in when exploring. Several artists were displayed, as was the reason for and invention of the Rocky Mountain garbage can. It was a good time spent.",
          "A wonderful collection of art and history of the Canadian Rockies. Whatever season you visit Banff, make the time to visit the Whyte Museum.",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. Lots of information boards to read. The staff are all very helpful.",
          "Lovely peaceful morning browsing great work of the Whyte family and paintings of Canada. Also exhibits of local heritage. Well worth a visit",
          "This is a lovely museum, only a few blocks off the main drag....within a short walk. The museum is a beautiful building, with a nice mix of modern to early 20th century art. It is in such a peaceful setting, it's nice to see some art in the midst of so many souvenir shops.",
          "I love that this museum features some women who were influential in surveying and recording the history of this period of history.",
          "They do free tours at various times, short but it gives context. Nice mix of history and social change, there is also a separate exhibition space, and a good gift shop. No cafe. Good value.",
          "Sorry, this museum is not worth the price of admission; it's too small and too dated. It mostly seems like it's about the Brewster family and their friend!",
          "Although small compared to many museums I've been to, this one packs a punch. If you're interested in the history of Banff and the Canadian Rockies, how they came to be developed and explored and the people who settled it, this is a great place to start. Aside from the",
          "Even with a movie crew doing their work in one section, we had free rein to walk around everywhere. Allow at least an hour. Be sure to see the video of the grizzly bear working on the trash containers. Tour not needed. One of the better regional museum in the Rockies.",
          "We (a family of 10) went in and there was something for everyone to see. The helicopter was a big hit with the teen. The old phone was moms top interest. So much to see. And then for the young ones there was a table with a little game. Nice",
          "With so many things to do in Banff, put this attraction on your list. Interesting art. The history of the area and the construction of the railroad are what caught my attention. The exhibits are fascinating. This is a small museum that is worth the admission price.",
          "A unique regional museum with striking depictions of the surrounding mountains & insightful history as well, this is a highly worthwhile introduction to the rich multi-faceted culture of northwest Canada & the remarkable personalities who contributed to it.",
          "Interesting historical exhibits and western art. Wonderful old period photos are in archival books. Don't miss the period houses that require a guide. Could have spent more than our allotted two hours just looking at the photos.",
          "This small museum is surprisingly interesting. It has very good local artist modern works, as well as some historical mountain climbing and hiking artifacts. There is also a real bubble helicopter you can sit in (once used to drop skiers off on mountains).",
          "A museum started from the collection of locals. Provides a good \"local\" version of the bigger story of the Rockies.",
          "Delightful little museum chock full of interesting facts about the historical figures for Banff. The museum can be done in about 1 hours. Pay a little more for the house tour which has some historical houses.",
          "If we hadn't purchased the museum pass then I'm not sure we'd have visited this one. Was nice to have s wander around though.",
          "The Whyte Museum is a hybrid history and art museum and is about the size one would expect in a town like Banff. The art was interesting as was the history section. Good if you're looking for something to do on a rainy day but, otherwise, not at all a \"must.\"",
          "It cost 10 Canadian Dollars to get in, which is fairly expensive considering what you get. So what do you get? *Well laid out exhibit *Detailed information provided *The opportunity to view the work of some local/Canadian artists (on-site gallery) The problem is there's just",
          "One floor with some indigenous history. If you have plenty of time, you can spend 30 mins here. otherwise, no need to stop by.",
          "It's a small museum but well done. We did the guided tour of the museum floor and the guide was well spoken and interesting. We paid the $2 extra and did the tour of the old homes which were fascinating, they seem to have been untouched for a hundred years and so many",
          "OK for a quick visit to fill in time. We arrived at 4.30 with closing at 5.00 and saw most things. Art gallery was not to our taste and a little disappointing. Overall not very good value. The staff are very helpful",
          "We didn't find a lot of things very interesting. The artistic part had too much space. I was hoping learning a lot more about the Rockies.",
          "A walk through this museum makes you long for the days of yore in Banff. That seems to be the time of true peace, quiet, and adventure amidst the majestic Rockies compared to today's hustle, bustle and overcrowding. The displays are excellent quality while the setting is low key",
          "Parents paid $2 for the tour and raved about it afterward. Context makes the exhibits come a live. Also has a great gift store. Check out the Art Gallery just behind it! Fabulous.",
          "We had tickets and went for the historical portion. It turned out that the art was the real attraction. While it was small their were several pieces that were different and very good.",
          "This museum is well worth a visit. They have excellent permanent exhibits reflecting the culture, history, and society of Banff represented with art work and artifacts. Curation of all exhibits is professional. They regularly host travelling exhibits that typically are well",
          "Very ordinary museum considering it looks as though there has been some money spent on it. I think the biggest problem is the lack of exhibits, it bordered on boring, and I like museums generally, Far too much room taken up by boring art exhibitions that you should not have to",
          "Established by local artists and philanthropists, this museum is well worth your time to visit. The \"Gateway to the Rockies\" tells of the history of the Canadian Rockies with artifacts, artworks, photographs and recordings, including a presentations on the First Nations",
          "The Whyte Museum was interesting and reasonably-priced. (Your AAA membership helps with the cost.) We browsed the artwork on our own, and then paid for 2 guided tours (1 inside the museum, and 1 to the historical homes on the property, for $2 extra). Our tour guide was",
          "The museum is very small for how much they charge for admission and while they give you a free general tour, it is extra to visit the cool houses on site. There is a tiny art gallery and a section of the history of the area. Didn't take more than an hour to thoroughly explore,",
          "Loved this place! So much information on the history of Banff and the locality really paints the picture for visitors to the area. We also went to see the houses on site and it was great to see how people really lived. Our guide (Alexander?) was very knowledgable and suggested",
          "This was such a surprise. It's small, manageable (especially for kids over ten interested in historical \"stuff\" (artifacts)) and so well done. The art collection is set apart from the historical section. Both are interesting - the historical is best. Our tour guide, Darren, was",
          "A delightful experience and a cultural treat. This is a must for all those who want a greater understanding of the history of the Rockies. The free guided tour was exceptional.",
          "We had some free time one day so we went to the Whyte Museum. We learned a bunch of history about the settling of the Canadian West. It is fun to walk through and get a feeling for the difficulties of settling that area",
          "Great gift shop. Art exhibit was a nice surprise. Lots of local exhibits. Even had elk sleeping on the front lawn.",
          "What an amazing museum! Growing up in Calgary I was sure I knew all about the history of Banff and the Canadian Rockies. I was mistaken, The museum has two sections one had the history, photos, memorabilia of early Banff and the other section . showcases some amazing",
          "I learnt so much about the history of this fantastic place, really interesting. At only $10 to get in I call this a bargain \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Half art gallery, half museum this place is totally worth a visit. It has a lot of history about Banff and is also pretty interactive (you can climb inside a helicopter and classic car Wooo!)",
          "Incredible museum with two sections (permanent and temporary exhibit spaces) and great gift shop. They also own three amazing heritage houses in Banff (two beside the museum - Peter and Catherine Whyte's home on the original site and the Moore house moved next door). You can",
          "It's small with only a few items on display. It tells an interesting story of the history of Banff but I got bored fairly quick. It only takes about a half hour to get through it. Kill some time",
          "After many many trips to Banff I finally visited this museum and I am glad we did. A vist to the museum will give anyone a good foundation in the people and experiences that established the Banff that we enjoy today. It does not take long, the exhibits are well done and you will",
          "Small museum founded by local artists has mixed media exhibits including photography and paintings. Regional emphasis is heavy on mountain guides and obscure pioneers. The curios are intriguing antiques. The helicopter used for heli-skiing looked scary small, like a flying",
          "Only small and a little \"personal collection\" style but well worth a visit. It gives you a great sense of the people who pioneered the Rockies culture, and those who make up the communities now. You can go through it in 20 minutes or take half a day - it is up to you. Very cheap",
          "Cold day in Banff and the want to know everything possible about the history of the area. The perfect place to find out more info than I ever thought possible about the area and its early inhabitants and visitors! The most helpful staff ever. Great day of sleuthing through",
          "This museum includes a lot of information on the original First Nations inhabitants of the area, as well as the European pioneers who developed Banff as a premier tourist destination in the Rockies. It features a surprising number of women artists and naturalists who",
          "For a small town museum, it was well established. There were lots of things we were allowed to touch or sit in (old helicopter, old car). It was an hour of something different and we had fun.",
          "Very interesting museum but quite small, also would have preferred more history and less of the photo art exhibit. The photos were OK but we came to learn not for art.",
          "It explains everything about the Rockies, with a great collection in every department. If you love science, history and you want to be an expert about the Rockies come here!",
          "I visited the Whyte Museum on a Sunday in January while my wife was skiing. I have been to Banff many times and decided that it was time to explore the museum. It is well laid out, with an art gallery section featuring local and western artists. The artifact section explores the",

          "We really enjoyed this museum. The museum covered the history of the area. they had a lot of pictures and artifacts.",
          "This place is great for local history, and the gallery has lots of great exhibits. It is a little dry in parts, but it is a museum, so you can tell which places get the least traffic. All things considered, if this is a great place to go if you are interested in the gallery, or",
          "We got to Whyte Museum just arriving before the skies opened and found a wealth of information on global warming supported by photos of glaciers taken in 1900 and 2000 and time lapse videos of glacier retreat. Interestingly, some had advanced! There were other videos showing",
          "The museum has a great variety from art to history and special exhibitions. definitely worth the price of admission. plan to spend about 2-3 hours there. the gift shop has a nice selection of books for local reading.",

          "Not only are the art and history exhibits always fascinating and of high quality, but also the gift shop has lovely treasures.",

          "What an opportunity to learn about the pioneers of the mountains in the Banff, Yoho, and Jasper National Parks. The presentation is attractive and readable.",
          "Good to include in a day walking around Banff. Exhibits are small and focused \u2013 we enjoyed a photography exhibit and a historical exhibit. Interesting gift shop included abundant historical books about Banff and the Rockies.",
          "This museum had someone who gave truly creative thought to how to depict the history of this area using various artifacts. We spent quite a bit of time here and enjoyed every minute. Exhibitions cover the fascinating periods from an 18th century surveyed to present-day",
          "The museum was temporarily marooned by some sort of road work, but we got there. A lot of art and photographs on display, relevant historic items, DVD presentation of all manner of things very well explained in an interesting way. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend",

          "We had a rainy cold day to visit Banff, and this museum was like a ray of sunshine. We learned about the history of the exploration and the environment, while being pleasantly surprised by a superb exhibit of Canadian fine art. If you visit only one museum in the Rockies, this",
          "The Whyte Museum has an excellent permanent display of early Banff, with hundreds of artifacts and artworks. To me, this would be worth seeing by itself; but they also have rotating art shows in their gallery by local and international artists. The adjacent Log home of Peter",
          "This museum and gallery is certainly worth a visit to gain a little more historical background to your trip to the Rockies. Fascinating exhibits, and well worth combining with the historical house tours. We really enjoyed it, and the shop was worth a look too.",
          "A museum that shouldn't be missed. Great history of the area with comparison pictures from the past to the present. Very affordable.",
          "This museum offers history of the area, the settlers, and the culture of this area. Interesting, well done and a contribution for admission.",
          "I was under the impression that this was an art museum & was pleased to learn it wasn't. There is a variety of artwork on display but I loved the historical exhibits more. It is a great place to learn about the history of Banff & the Canadian Rockies in general. You can even",
          "This museum and art gallery is very well presented, and worth a visit if time is to spare, or if the weather is inclement. A very well documented history of the peoples of Banff, its First Nation people, the CPR, the mining industry, and the intense exploration of the",
          "We spent a wet afternoon here and there are interesting things to see and a good variety. We had a tour of the houses and you should definitely add this in. Tour guide had good knowledge.",

          "Very interesting exhibits and artwork along with so much information about this part of Canada. Plan to spend about an hour",
          "Small but relevant museum. Staff show pride in their work. The archives are what make this museum a 5! Staff in the archives answer every one of my MANY questions and are very knowledgeable on local history. Just make sure you have at least a couple hours to go through photos!",
          "Excellent Museum. Recommend catching the free tours as you get to go into two of the original log houses in the grounds.",
          "This is a small museum but has some great exhibits. We were lucky enough to arrive in time for a tour of the two cottages which was a highlight of the museum. Staff were friendly and informative.",
          "We had a great time at the Whyte Museum, despite having low expectations. The displays were informative about local history and included video, sound etc. We wanted to research Canmore mining in detail and so were able to sit in the archives for a while, reading their books on",
          "Had a free day in Banff while touring and decided to start our day with a visit to this museum. We were not disappointed. Very knowledgable guide and as an added bonus we were guided through the two heritage houses adjacent the museum. Very philanthropic families contributed to",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and gained a lot of local information. The paintings of Catherine Whyte were particularly memorable",
          "This is a relly interesting museum, set up by the Whyte family with many of their own personal items of clothing anf furniture and artifacts that they gathered in their trips across canadian rockies. You must not miss the guided tour of their log cabin and many of their",
          "What a pleasant surprise on a rainy day. This museum has something for everyone -- a dose of history, technology, art, photographs. Very interesting, even for kids and non-museum goers. They have an old car from an early trip by British royalty and a helicopter used for",
          "This is a very nice museum. We enjoyed the information about local history. The displays are well done. It is worth taking the time to stop in.",
          "As another commented pointed out, the official city map lists this museum as open for a donation, but in fact there is a mandatory $8 admission fee, $6 with AAA membership. The museum itself is small. We tagged along one of the guided tours, which lasted about 30 minutes,",
          "We discovered this museum walking past it. None of the hotel information or guides we read highlighted it but it was so good we went back the following day. It is an amazing place with well presented exhibitions, helpful staff and a must for anyone visiting Banff!!",
          "Located right in the middle of Banff, this is a couple of hours well spent, particularly is the weather is a little wet! Also, take the guided walk of the log cabins in the grounds and learn more about the Whyte Family who lived in these fully furnished cabins. Recommended.",
          "My AAA tour book had recommended this as good place for information an a donation was all requested. When we arrived I was rudely advised an admission was charged and No we do not give discounts for seniors or AAA. We travel on budget so did not go in instead we went to Buffalo",
          "If you enjoy mountaineering, history, and art then this is worth a stop. The entry fee is affordable and the museum accepts US AAA memberships for a discount on the entry and in the gift shop.",
          "This museum has some great artefacts and interesting information about the Rockies as well as a small art gallery. Well worth a visit.",
          "Would definitely recommend visiting this small museum and art gallery. The left hand side is an art gallery which holds exhibitions and the right hand side is a museum of the history of Banff. Very interesting and informative displays. You could be in an out in an hour or 20",
          "The museum is quite small, but has some interesting insights into the history of Banff. We were particularly interested in the tours offered to the onsite homesteads. However these guided tours were a bit of a let down. While our guide, Emily, was very informative and added her",
          "This is a wonderful small museum that really gives you a flavour of the foundations of Banff National Park, the original mountaineers and the way things were developed. It is very interesting and suitable for all ages but not quite so much for young children.",
          "Small but nicely organized museum in downtown Banff. We came in order to get the historic houses tour but were somewhat disappointed. Not much in the houses is displayed in a coherent manner (e.g., shelves full of collectibles without so much as a sign indicating what they",
          "there isnt much to do with children at this attraction. you need to find a bit more things for children to do,",
          "The museum building itself is worth seeing, it is very nice. The part dealing with the history of mountaineering and guiding, the old gear and photographs displayed are wonderful and very moving. I didn't (but this is a question of personal taste!) especially like the art",
          "Eclectic museum with paintings,artifacts from the 1st Nations, history of opening up the Rockies. TV screens tell stories of local interest (chairs in front so you can rest a bit while soaking in some knowledge). When buying your entrance ticket be sure and sign up for the",
          "We visited the Whyte museum while staying in Banff and found it very interesting, with a mix of exhibit halls, featuring contemporary and historical themes, as well as some art. The museum is well arranged, with a modern feel, and we learnt a lot about the area and its history.",
          "The Whyte Museum is located in downtown Banff near the river. Both the current and permanent exhibits were wonderful - a nice mix of contemporary art and historical interest. Interesting gift shop also.",
          "A small museum area, displaying some of the local history, but much of the area focussed as an Art Gallery, with one area exclusively photographs, with both historical and Current photos of the area. Some of the artwork very good, but really, not what we expected in a museum.",
          "This turned out to be a very interesting place full of information on the first mappers and trail finders. How the different families made Banff what it is today.",
          "Take an hour and go through this. The Vaux family photographs showing the melting of the glaciers is worth it.",
          "This small museum is well-worth a visit, particularly for first-timers in Canada. It houses a collection of artefacts representative of the daily life of both the First Nation people and settlers. The display of native headdresses was particularly impressive although I'm not",
          "On a rainy day we popped into the Whyte Museum and were very taken with the layout a stunning visual art exhibition ,Exhibits including a cat and helicopter a well layed out gift shop and the option of a guided tour . A very helpful receptionist full of tips and information",
          "The \"eau\" or \"water\" art exhibit was outstanding, and the rest of the museum gave a good overview of the history of this area. Really enjoyed it, and it offered a nice respite from busy, crowded Banff Avenue.",
          "Be sure to get a free ticket to the Whyte House as well, a small museum with an excellent curator. Like all Canadian Museums they are now featuring the contributions of women explorers. Yes, they had them. Enjoyed it much.",

          "Our tour manager suggested we visit this Museum and we were glad we did. There are some very interesting exhibits and displays. The high spot for me was the Beadwork. As someone who does beadwork, i appreciated the skill and amount of work involved in making the items.",
          "It's really nice for such a small town. Free parking just in front. Beautiful location. Great experience after all. Beautiful statue in front",
          "Interesting museum of local history & culture. Had a 'water' Art exhibition running. $8 entrance fee. You can easily spend a good hour there",
          "This museum is small, very warm and welcoming. Its is doable in a couple of hours. Really gives you a taste of the history and culture of the Canadian Rockies. Very relaxed and enjoyable",
          "Excellent and resourceful place with stories of great explorers displayed all over the place. Has some great artifacts, You can also see the cabin where the early settlers lived. Good place. Please visit it and learn about the first settlers.",
          "This is a fine museum - small but choice - that grew out of the collections of Peter and Catherine Whyte, artists who devoted their work and lives to this region. We saw a beautiful exhibition titled \"Water\"; the historical reviews were also presented well, with just enough",
          "The museum is very well displayed with helpful guides as well as interesting audio visual displays .we learnt a lot",
          "Very nice facility located convenient to downtown restaurants and parking. The museum had more art than I was expecting, it was nice but not my taste. They had a number of informative historical displays of early pioneers and mountain guides. I was hoping for a little more on",
          "Though this museum is listed as a place to visit in Banff, it is very, very tiny (about the size of an average 3 bedroom house. One room has local, contemporary artist works. The other room has artifacts from mountaineers. You can tour 2 log homes off the premise of the",
          "Small but very interesting museum. A good visit if you have the extra time. My third time to Banff I took the time to visit. Glad I did.",
          "Really liked this museum - it's small and packed with information and art from the Rockies. The information areas provided examples of how people survived in the area.",
          "Very interesting information and item on display to see how the first settlers to present day made Banff for what it is!",
          "We noticed this museum when on holiday in Banff and decided to have a look at the exhibition. An interesting art exhibition with painting, sculpture and items created using a camera obscura. The museum has displays showing the early days of the Canadian Rockies development",
          "The photography was amazing and exhibited techniques I've never seen before. Some of the photos of early life as well as the exhibit pertaining to those who surveyed and mapped the Rockies were excellent. But an ART gallery? Not so much. I came away a bit unimpressed and",
          "Interesting place to browse on the history of Banff. Takes about an hour depending how much info you want to take in. We also went on the guided museum tour of the houses that the Whyte's and others lived in. Our tour guide Natalie was great! She was very informative and",

          "Some nice things to see here, and for 8$, you cant go wrong, spent about an hour here, it was a nice quite stop after doing some shopping downtown.",
          "Honestly quite disappointing to pay the $8 each to go in. And see very few exhibits. Some might enjoy but it's more of an art gallery. :( \ud83d\udc4e",
          "We love this great art gallery/museum! Always excellent art exhibits and the history exhibits are very well done too! Worth the admission!",
          "This museum is a treasure trove of information! Exhibits from the early years of Banff National Park as well as more modern exhibits stand side by side to inform and entertain the guests!!",
          "This little museum has lots of information and photos of and from pioneers that explored it. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Located on 111 Bear Street, diagonally across from the Banff Park Museum. The current exhibition of photographs from a 1924 Columbia Icefield exhibition won't disappoint. The museum also has an archive and library. It has a reproduction service for those wanting to take home",
          "This place was clean, nice, inexpensive, and informative. It was not large. It had a nice gift shop, was right down town, and was very close to parking. Overall, a good hour of entertainment and education.",

          "We ended up in Banff on a rainy day and thought we would drop in to the Whyte Museum for something to do. It's payment by donation, open until 5pm. The exhibitions aren't all permanent and I loved the two photography exhibits that were on. Very informative, full of local",
          "i agree with other reviewers, if you have an hour, or so spare, this is an interesting museum to visit. Whilst I was there it had two displays - a local artist and Banff and surrounds commitment to WW1, as well as information about how Banff was established. I took quite a while",
          "some good paintings by Peter and Catharine Whyte and others. Interesting and insightful exhibits on the history of the park and of the town",
          "This is not a big museum but has some great history. Good old pictures. It is free - but you are sort of expected to pay a $5.00 per person donation. Worth it if you are curious and have an hour.",
          "The attention to programs aimed at all ages was impressive with great ideas for children. As a community museum it fills a valuable niche as art gallery, museum, and archive for Banff and the Rockies.",
          "I found it weak. If I knew I would not have wasted my time there. From best to explore the natural beauties that are magnificent.",
          "We stopped in here for an hour or so on a rainy fall day while in Banff, and found the many varied exhibits of life and art in the Canadian Rockies very interesting. Well worth the meager suggested donation for admission!",
          "There is always a section in the gallery which will educate you on the \"Rockies\", it's beginning, it's development and the experience of Peter & Catharine Whyte. Any visit to Banff should include a visit to the Whyte museum.",

          "The museum offers standing exhibits as well as special limited engagement presentations. The lower level contains art work by the museum's founders, Peter and Catherine Whyte. Especially interesting was the Gateway to the Rockies presentation depicting the history of early",
          "More by accident than design we saw this museum and entered. It was very interesting for us, seeing yet another culture, before they were invaded by folk, some of whom, simply sought to make profit. One part of the museum relates to First Nations which was very interesting.",
          "we spent a rainy day and found it very informative. Not many people with children there but as adults we really liked it. staff very helpful.",
          "There is a vey good permanent section in the back, which is home to a lot of park and Banff history. It is very interesting. There is also a small display room in the lower level, which should always be visited. The main portion is for changing exhibits, so the quality will",
          "Some may find the magic of Banff a bit Disney'fied with its streets of souvenir shops, cafes and day trippers however the Banff Museum shows the early beginnings of the Rockies to the present day through photographs and paintings. Well presented with a good contribition from",

          "We visited the Whyte Museum in September, and there was a great Native American art exhibit. The art was exquisite and not something you can usually view. It was a traveling exhibit, there until Oct, so I can not speak to the museum collection by itself. As a history buff I",
          "This small museum is well set out and will lead you through the geological development of the Rocky Mountains as well as document all the human activities that have occurred and are still occurring. I was pleased to see a significant amount of space given to the First Nations",

          "The museum was fantastic, it was so well put together! I spent about an hour just reading all the information on the walls. It was also interactive! During the time I was there they had the Indigenous Ingenuity gallery on display. beautiful art, crafts, pieces, and photographs",
          "Caught in heavy snow, this museum was suggested to us as a good indoor activity. I enjoyed finding out more about the history of the Canadian Rockies, those who had travelled to the area many years ago and the first nations people. It's quite small so doesn't take long but is",

          "Beautiful small museum with art and artifacts. Fascinating to see the primitive equipment used to climb these huge mountains back in the 1800s. Lovely exhibit with modern and old Indian art and clothing.",
          "Stopped in on a rainy day and took the tour with a docent in the First Nations exhibit. It was very informative and the schoolhouse instillation was bone chilling. It was worthwhile!",
          "It was raining so we gave up shopping and went to the Whyte where we had 2 free docent tours; one of homes on the property and one of the museum. Very informative, not too long and interesting collections of First Nations beadwork, etc. Great for a rainy day when the trails",
          "Wandering around Banff my wife and I stumbled onto this museum. It was a great collection of historic photos of the town and surroundings. The gift shop is worth a visit too. There are prints and originals by local artists and plenty of collectables to help you commemorate your",

          "The admission is a donation so no matter what you contribute it was worth it. It is a small museum. One area is dedicated to the Native population in the area and the other main room is dedicated to the Banff area during the time period of the founders. The best part and not to",
          "We spent a very pleasant hour (or a little less) at the museum. It is a nice little place. Not worth driving from Calgary for ;-) but definitely worth the hour. Our kids liked the heli-ski and old-time exhibits, the grown ups also enjoyed the art exhibits. Definitely worth",
          "This is a very well done museum of the history of Banff in regard to the native peoples and the first town settlers. There is wonderful art work, photography, and exhibits or early settlers. The original homes of some of the early Banff settlers are on site and available to see",

          "The museum can be found on the right just for the bridge over river if heading towards Sulphur Mountain. There 4 car park places on the street out front and a large public car park at the rear. The rear carpark also has public toilets and is a great place to if coming from out",

          "This museum has some very interesting bits of history. Not overly Wow...but a nice way to enjoy Banff from a different perspective. After all...you can only shop in Banff for so many days. Would I go again the next time in Banff? No. Am I pleased that we went....yes.",
          "Entry fee is a donation recommended $5 which is very reasonable. Interesting historical photos and artifacts especially of the women who explored the Rockies and displays of First Nations art. We arrived just in time for a half hour tour and as it was just us we felt we had a",

          "Lovely litre museum which displays and informs of the cruel things the native people of Canada have had to endure over the years. A massive shame to see how native people were treated here and anywhere else in the world to that matter. In any case, its worth going to educate",

          "Let me say right off the bat, this is a very good museum and gallery - for the price. Admission is by donation and they suggest five bucks, which I would say is a pretty good deal. If they charged in the fifteen to twenty dollar range that many museums do, I probably wouldn't be",
          "We had a spare hour when in Banff so we visited this museum. There was an excellent photography exhibition going on, which we very much enjoyed. We only had a short time to see the rest of the exhibits but were impressed by the good layout and interesting information - it is a",

        "wiki": "Carolynn Marie \"Lynn\" Hill (born January 3, 1961) is a U.S. rock climber. Widely regarded as one of the leading competitive sport climbers in the world during the late 1980s and early 1990s, she is famous for making the first free ascent of the difficult sheer rock face of The Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley, and for repeating it the next year in less than 24 hours. She has been described as both one of the best female climbers in the world and one of the best climbers of all time. One of the first successful women in the sport, Hill shaped rock climbing for women and became a public spokesperson, helping it gain wider popularity and arguing for sex equality. Hill has publicized climbing by appearing on television shows and documentaries and writing an autobiography, Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World.\nHill was a gymnast early in life, nearly broke a world record lifting weights, and ran competitively. She took to climbing at a young age, showing a natural aptitude for the activity, and became a part of the climbing community in Southern California and Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley. She traveled around the United States during the early 1980s climbing increasingly difficult routes and setting records for first female ascents and for first ascents. From 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's most accomplished sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1992, Hill left competitive climbing and returned to her first love: traditional climbing. She set for herself the challenge of free climbing The Nose of El Capitan, her greatest climbing feat. Hill continues to climb and has not stopped taking on ambitious climbs. As of 2013, she was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company and owned a small business that offered climbing courses.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\n\n=== Childhood ===\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan, Hill grew up in Fullerton, California. She is the fifth of seven children; her mother was a dental hygienist and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls \"had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor\". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling \"resistant to rules\", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: \"My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow\". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls\u2014the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.\n\n\n=== Introduction to climbing ===\nIn 1975, her sister and her sister's fianc\u00e9, Chuck Bludworth, took Hill on her first climbing trip; she was hooked, leading from the first day. For Hill, this activity became an escape from the emotional turmoil of her parents' divorce, and \"by her late teens she identified less with her imperfect family in Orange County than with an 'imperfect family of friends' at climbing areas\". Hill took her first trip to Yosemite, a central destination for climbers, at the age of 16, where she was introduced to the climbers at Camp 4. There she met Charlie Row, her first boyfriend. Their romance flourished; with him she climbed her first 5.11 and first big wall.As a young teenager, Hill climbed in southern California, primarily in Joshua Tree National Park. She earned money for day trips out to the park by working at a Carl's Jr. Bludworth initially taught her climbing culture; he subscribed to magazines and read books which Hill then devoured. She was influenced in particular by Yvon Chouinard's ethic of \"leaving no trace\" on the rock. Moreover, the climbing of Beverly Johnson captured her imagination, particularly Johnson's 10-day solo of Dihedral Wall on El Capitan. As Hill explains in her autobiography, \"I was awed, but not just by the know-how and hard work she'd put into her ascent. It was the courage and confidence that it took to put herself on the line, to do something on the cutting edge\u2014to climb one of the world's greatest big walls in one of the most challenging ways possible: solo. She had succeeded and she'd given women climbers like me enormous confidence to be ourselves and not feel limited by being a minority in a male-dominated sport.\"\n\nHill attended Fullerton College in the late 1970s, but she did not have a strong interest in any academic subject; instead she was focused on climbing. In the summers of 1976\u201378 and the early 1980s Hill frequently camped at Camp 4 in Yosemite Valley, becoming part of the climbing community centered there and joining the search and rescue team. In her autobiography, Hill describes the community as \"a ragged occupying army, annoying park rangers by eluding camp fees, overstaying their welcome, and comporting themselves like gypsies\". As Hill describes it, climbing in the late 1970s and early 1980s was \"something that people who were outcasts in society did, people who were not conformists\". As she had earlier, Hill worked in order to be able to climb. One summer, she writes, she survived in Camp 4 on only $75. In her autobiography, she describes how climbers eked out a life at the camp, recycling cans to pay for climbing ropes and subsisting on condiments and left-over food from tourists. However, Hill remembers \"these dirt-poor days ... [as] among the best and the most carefree of my life, and though my friends were often scoundrels, I felt their friendship convincingly.\"Beverly Johnson had previously started to bridge the gender gap at Camp 4, but it remained strongly male-dominated. The community was particularly homosocial; its major historian calls it \"edgy\" rather than \"oppressive\" and argues that there was pressure on women to perform to men's standards and that \"women had to contend with an army of men trying to maintain Camp 4 as a guy's domain\". There was no coherent female climbing community; rather, female climbers tended to adopt the masculine attitudes of their compatriots. In her autobiography, Hill writes that climbing \"back then was directed by a fraternity of men, and there was little encouragement of, or frankly, inclination for women to participate. Yet women climbers were out there.\" For example, from age 18 to 22, Hill climbed with Mari Gingery every weekend, completing an ascent of The Nose and then the first female-only ascent of The Shield on El Capitan over a period of six days.Hill learned the essence of her climbing technique from the Stonemasters group during this time. She adopted the attitudes of traditional climbing, a style of climbing which emphasizes using removable protection rather than bolts (which scar the rock) and rewards climbers who climb a new route from bottom to top without stopping or starting over. She also became a dedicated free climber, which emphasizes climbing an entire route without hanging on the rope or relying on equipment to skip difficult sections. Early on she was a fearless climber but after \"a few death-defying experiences on routes with long run-outs\" she learned to be wary of falling.Hill climbed with and became involved with climber John Long at the end of the 1970s. Their relationship began in the summer of 1978 when she heard him recite a poem he had written about a female climber and what kind of man she wanted.Hill and Long climbed together and worked out together, lifting weights and running. It was at his suggestion that she attempted to break the world record for the bench press in her weight class (105 pounds (48 kg)); however, while she could easily lift 150 pounds (68 kg) while training, in competition she froze. Hill and Long spent the winter of 1981 in Las Vegas, Nevada climbing during the day and working nights at \"dead end jobs\" like pizza waitress.The following year Hill and Long moved from Las Vegas to Santa Monica, California where she attended Santa Monica College (SMC) and majored in biology. She was recruited by the track coach even though she had no competitive running experience. After training for a few months, she placed third in the 1500 meters and fourth in the 3000 meters at the state meet, helping SMC to win the state championship. To make ends meet, she worked at an outdoor store, as a gym teacher, and occasionally appeared on daredevil television shows.In 1983, Hill was interviewed by Ultrasport. They offered her a free flight to New York for the interview and as part of the trip she was taken to the Shawangunks, a famous nearby climbing area. Finding she liked the climbing environment and yearning for some new challenges, she decided to stay and moved to New Paltz, New York. At the same time, Long was preparing for a journey to Borneo and embarking on a career as a writer. The couple went their separate ways but remained friends. After moving to New York, Hill attended the State University of New York at New Paltz and graduated with a degree in biology in 1985.\n\n\n== Climbing career ==\n\nHill started to participate in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but one of her first significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said \"that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent\". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates the reason for this is that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: \"The big lesson for me ... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping ... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all.\"Living near the Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free climbing routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals was the most difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it \"one of the boldest leads I've ever seen ... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out\u2014when you see someone totally on the edge.\" It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, \"In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy ... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived.\" That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, \"perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time\". She was arguably \"the best climber in the Gunks\", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and \"no man was climbing significantly better\" than her.\n\n\n=== Competitive career ===\nAs a result of Hill's impressive climbs in The Gunks, she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986. The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge, Fontainebleau, and Buoux. Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing. She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges, producing \"wildly acrobatic climbs\" with low risk. Moreover, these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature, like Hill. She tried sport climbing in France for the first time that year. Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture, she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia '86, the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition, which later became the Rock Master annual event. The event was divided into two stages, one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia, Italy. She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes, gaining points for style and speed. She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a \"disputed ruling\" but won in the following year. Destivelle in her autobiography, reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning, as speed was decisive in case of equality, which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition. In an interview, Hill has said that this first competition was \"disorienting\" because she did not understand the language, the \"format\" or the \"judging\" nor did the organizers of the competition. \"There were a lot of politics involved, a lot of nationalism and disorganization. The rules seemed to change during the event. I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women. The only response I got was, 'If the women climb without their tops, then we'll pay them the same.'\" However, she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with \"other strong women\". In one interview, Hill said that \"if there wasn't a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane ... or whoever there, then it would be anticlimactic.\" Destivelle became Hill's main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s.\n\nShe became a professional climber in 1988 and the subsequent interviews, photoshoots and media appearances led to her becoming a spokesperson for climbing. As Hill explained, competition climbing is \"such a different activity than going out and climbing on rock ... You're in front of all these people ... You're there to perform.\"  From the beginning of her sport climbing career, Hill was aware that the sport was evolving and growing. For example, she pointed out in an interview that some competition organizers would chop down trees and alter rocks just for the sake of a competition; she could foresee that competitions would all eventually take place on artificial walls for environmental reasons.Throughout the early 1980s, Hill had remained a traditionalist, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging on the rope at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a \"Great Debate\" in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants\u2014including Hill\u2014were invited to discuss the merits of the two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that \"the purpose of climbing is to adapt yourself to the rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock ... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible ... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places\u2014to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others\".\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992 Hill was one of the world's top sport climbers, winning over thirty international titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall\u2014and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, \"at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female\". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition\u2014Isabelle Patissier\u2014received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). \"It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top ... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of\u2014a lot of the best men had fallen off that route.\" As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.In January 1990, Hill set another landmark by becoming the first woman to redpoint a 5.14 (that is, she practiced free climbing the route before she was able to successfully climb it), Masse Critique in Cima\u00ef, France. J.B. Tribout, who first ascended the route, challenged Hill, saying no woman would ever be able to climb it\u2014Hill completed it in fewer tries than Tribout, after \"nine days of exhausting effort\". In 1992, it was described as the hardest rock climb ever made by a woman.Hill has experienced only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting to tie a safety rope, she fell 85 ft (25 m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing for a few months to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.\n\n\n=== The Nose ===\n\nHill did not regard sport climbing to be real climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 and went back to traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, \"the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession\". In her autobiography, she also comments on the \"bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions\". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.\nAsked why she was motivated to climb The Nose, Hill has said:\n\nAt the end of my competition career I felt like things were evolving more towards the indoor format and it really wasn't how I started to climb and it didn't represent the values of climbing in a complete way and so I decided I would do something like this as a retirement gesture. John Long said 'hey Lynnie you should go up and try to free climb The Nose'. So it just happened to be the perfect goal for me and I liked the fact this climb was in Yosemite because I remember going there and just seeing the valley and it was just mind blowing how beautiful it was. I couldn't imagine a more beautiful place anywhere in the world. For me The Nose was much bigger than me, it wasn't about me, it wasn't about my ego, my gratification it was actually something that I wanted to do. I felt like I had a chance and that if I could do that it would be a really big statement to people to think about. You don't have to be a man to do something that's 'out there' as a first ascent. Obviously people tried to do that route and they failed on it and so if a lot of good climbers have come and tried to do it and failed and a woman comes and does it first it's really meaningful. That was my underlying motivation.\nHill first attempted to free climb The Nose in 1989 with Simon Nadin, a climber she had met at the World Cup that year. Although he had never climbed big walls, she felt at ease around him and both had a background in traditional climbing; they both shared a desire to free climb The Nose and agreed within hours of meeting to try the feat together. Their attempt to free climb The Nose failed. Four years later, in 1993, together with her partner Brooke Sandahl, she became the first person, male or female, to free climb the route. Hill's original climbing grade for the \"Free Nose\" was 5.13b. One of the most difficult pitches\u2014Changing Corners\u2014she rated at a 5.13b/c, but she wrote in her autobiography that \"rating the difficulty of such a pitch is almost impossible\" and \"the most accurate grade would be to call it 'once, or maybe twice, in a lifetime'\". The rock face is nearly blank and there are next to no holds; to ascend the section, Hill had to use a \"carefully coordinated sequence of opposite pressures between [her] feet, hands, elbows, and hips against the shallow walls of the corner\" as well as turn her body completely around.The next year, in 1994 she surpassed this achievement, by becoming the first person to free climb the entire route in a single 24-hour period. Usually the climb takes four to six days (Hill had previously done it in four) and most climbers are aid climbing; that is, most climbers allow themselves to use mechanical aids to assist their climbing rather than just their own skill and bodies.Hill wanted to join her effort with that of making a film that \"would convey the history and spirit of climbing\". Hill started endurance training in the spring for her summer ascent of The Nose, aiming to be able to on-sight a 5.13b after climbing all day. She trained in Provence and tested herself against Mingus in the Verdon Gorge, making the first on-sight free ascent of the route without a fall while simultaneously being the first woman to on-sight a 5.13b.In her autobiography, Hill explains how she had \"underestimated\" how complicated climbing The Nose in a day would be with a film crew. Endless complications arose, such as the American coproducer backing out at the last minute, the soundman and cameraman refusing to rappel down the summit because they were afraid, and minor technical problems such as dead batteries. Hill herself had to coordinate many of the logistics because the producer had abandoned the project. Her first attempt to free climb The Nose in a day was plagued with problems. She ran out of chalk after 22 pitches, very nearly ran out of water and was taxed by the intense heat. She tried again soon after. On September 19 at 10pm, she and her partner Steve Sutton, began the ascent again, this time without a film crew. After 23 hours, she had free climbed the entire route. In his book on the changing culture of Yosemite climbers, Joseph Taylor explains that Hill's ascent of The Nose demonstrates how climbing in the Yosemite Valley had altered from its origins in 1960s counterculture to become a \"consumable experience\". Hill staged what he describes as a \"spectacle\", filming the event \"to capture the spontaneity of her one-day ascent\", but she was only successful when not surrounded by a film crew.The \"Free Nose\" and the \"Free Nose in a day\" remained unrepeated over 10 years after Hill's first ascents\u2014despite numerous attempts by some of the best big wall climbers in the world. Over time, a consensus grade of 5.14a/b has emerged for the most difficult pitch, known as pitch 27 or Changing Corners, a fact which cements her Free Nose ascents as two of the most impressive achievements in climbing history. At the time, climbing legend Yvon Chouinard called it \"the biggest thing that has ever been done on rock\" and Alexander Huber later wrote that this climb \"passed men's dominance in climbing and left them behind\". He also regarded her statement upon completing the climb of \"It goes, boys!\" as reasonable although other climbers regarded it as provocative.The Nose saw a second free ascent in 1998, when Scott Burke summitted after 261 days of effort. Then, on October 14, 2005, the team of Tommy Caldwell and Beth Rodden also free climbed The Nose, and on October 16, 2005, Caldwell did it in less than 12 hours.\n\n\n=== World traveler ===\n\nIn 1995, Hill joined The North Face climbing team and was paid to travel around the world to climb. She first visited Kyrgyzstan's Karavshin Valley to climb with Alex Lowe, Kitty Calhoun, Jay Smith, Conrad Anker, Greg Child, Dan Osman, and Chris Noble. They camped for a month and were cut off from the world, without even a radio. In her autobiography, Hill writes that \"such isolation made me feel vulnerable\". Hill was not used to mountain climbing (as opposed to rock climbing) and the unpredictability of it unnerved her, with its increased risk of storms and rock slides. Furthermore, she liked focusing on the style of ascending rather than just summitting; she realized on this trip that her style of free climbing was not conducive to summitting or mountain climbing. Rather than pursue ever higher climbs, therefore, she chose to climb in new places, such as Morocco, Vietnam, Thailand, Scotland, Japan, Madagascar, Australia, and South America; many of these climbs were filmed and helped promote climbing in general.Hill started offering climbing camps in five locations in the United States in 2005, with plans for more. For US$2,000, participants received five days of an \"immersive adventure camp\", including one-on-one coaching from Hill and other famous climbers. As of 2012 Hill was living in Boulder, Colorado and still travelling widely. From Boulder she runs a small business offering climbing courses and also works as a technical adviser for various climbing gear companies. As of 2013, Hill was a sponsored athlete for the Patagonia gear and clothing company. While Hill used to easily obtain sponsorships, in 2010 she said in an interview that she was \"too old\" to obtain shoe sponsorships.\n\n\n=== Gender politics ===\nHill repeatedly tells a story from when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how surprised he was that she could do the route because even he could not. \"I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I not to be able to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex.\"Long an advocate for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued that men and women can climb the same routes: \"I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing\". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men \"spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women\". In answer to a question about whether or not women \"will ever equal or surpass men in climbing\", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing \"favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios[s]\", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women \"have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance\". She explained that \"theoretically somebody as short as me could be the best in the world because it doesn't depend so much on height now ... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing.\"Hill experienced discrimination throughout her climbing career and in an interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that \"there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is\". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the \"tomboy\" she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.Hill has been credited with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it and in part because Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt \"responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion\". Climber John Long explains that Hill \"was a prodigy and everyone knew as much ... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off\u2014which she did with maddening frequency\u2014folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes\u2014or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nHill has participated in various television productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for the men in the competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's half of the show because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She \"became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man's world\". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as \"perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did\". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.In 1999, Hill appeared in Extreme, an IMAX film on adventure sports. For that production, she and Nancy Feagin had been filmed the previous May crack climbing in Indian Creek Valley in Utah. She also appeared in Vertical Frontier, a documentary about competitive climbing in California's Yosemite Valley.In 2002, Hill collaboratively wrote an autobiography, Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World, with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, published by W.W. Norton & Company. As she describes the process, \"He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was.\" Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to \"convey the history and culture of free climbing\", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: \"And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point [sic], because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there.\" Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHill met fellow Gunks climber Russ Raffa on her first trip to New York and by 1984 he had become \"her constant companion\". On October 22, 1988, the two married; however, their relationship ended in March 1991 in part because Hill wanted children and because the couple rarely saw each other. At the same time, Hill moved to Grambois, France, to pursue her climbing career; she settled there because of the world-class climbing areas in the Lub\u00e9ron region and the many friends she had there. While living and climbing in Europe, Hill became fluent in both French and Italian.Hill met her partner as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a climbing trip in Moab, Utah, and at the age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, \"I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made.\"In 2015 she was inducted into the Boulder (Colorado) Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Notable ascents ==\n\n1979, Ophir Broke II 5.12d, Telluride, Colorado \u2212 First free ascent and first female ascent of the grade, with John Long\n1979, Pea Brain 5.12d, Independence Pass, Colorado \u2212 First free ascent and first female ascent of the grade, with John Long\n1979, Stairway to Heaven III 5.12, Tahquitz Peak, California \u2212 First free ascent, with John Long and Tim Powell\n1980, Coatamundi Whiteout II 5.12, Granite Mountain, Arizona \u2212 First free ascent, with John Long and Keith Cunning\n1981, Hidden Arch 5.12a, Joshua Tree, California \u2212 First free ascent\n1981, Levitation 29 IV 5.11a, Red Rock, Nevada \u2212 First free ascent, with John Long and Jorge and Joanne Urioste\n1982, Blue Nubian 5.11, Joshua Tree, California \u2212 First free ascent\n1984, Yellow Crack 5.12R/X, Shawangunks \u2212 First free ascent\n1984, Vandals, 5.13b, Shawangunks \u2212 First ascent\n1984, Organic Iron 5.12c, Shawangunks \u2212 First ascent\n1985, Organic Iron 5.12c, Shawangunks \u2212 First free ascent, with Russ Raffa\n1987, Girls Just Want to Have Fun 5.12 X, Shawangunks \u2212 First free ascent\n1988, The Greatest Show on Earth 5.12d, New River Gorge, West Virginia \u2212 First free ascent\n1989, Running Man 5.13d, Shawangunks \u2212 First free ascent\n1990, Masse Critique 5.14, Cima\u00ef, France, \u2212 First woman to redpoint a 5.14\n1992, Simon 5.13b, Frankenjura, Germany \u2212 First female onsight of the grade\n1993, The Nose 5.14a/b, El Capitan, Yosemite \u2212 First to free climb with partner Brooke Sandahl\n1994, Mingus V 5.13a, 12 pitches, Verdon Gorge, France \u2212 First free ascent, onsight\n1994, The Nose 5.14a/b, El Capitan, Yosemite \u2212 First free ascent\n1995, Clodhopper Direct IV 5.10+, Central Pyramid, Kyrgyzstan \u2212 First ascent, with Greg Child\n1995, Perestroika Crack V 5.12b, Peak Slesova, Kyrgyzstan \u2212 First free ascent, with Greg Child\n1995, West Face V 5.12b, Peak 4810, Kyrgyzstan \u2212 First free ascent, with Alex Lowe\n1997, Tete de Chou 5.13a, Todra Gorge, Morocco \u2212 First ascent\n1998, Midnight Lightning V8, Camp 4, Yosemite \u2212 First female ascent\n1998, King Cobra V8, Camp 4, Yosemite \u2212 First female ascent\n1998, To Bolt or Not to Be 5.14a, Smith Rocks, Oregon \u2212 First female ascent\n1999, Scarface 5.14a, Smith Rocks, Oregon \u2212 First female ascent\n1999, Bravo les Filles VI 5.13d A0, 13 pitches, Tsaranoro Massif, Madagascar \u2212 First ascent, with Nancy Feagin, Kath Pyke,  and Beth Rodden\n2004, Viva la Liberdad 5.12b, Vinales, Cuba \u2212 First ascent\n2004, Sprayathon 5.13c, Rifle, Colorado \u2212 First female ascent\n2005, West Face, Leaning Tower, V 5.13b/c, Yosemite \u2212 First female free ascent, with Katie Brown\n\n\n== Competitions ==\n1986, Grand-Prix d'Escalade, Troubat, winner\n1987, Rock Master, Arco, Italy, winner\n1987, World Indoor Rock Climbing Premier, winner, Grenoble, France\n1988, Rock Master, Arco, Italy, winner\n1988, International Climbing competition, winner, Marseille, France\n1988, Masters Competition, winner, Paris, France\n1989, Rock Master, Arco, Italy, winner\n1989, Masters Competition, winner, Paris, France\n1989, German Free Climbing Championships, winner\n1989, International Climbing competition, winner\n1989, World Cup, winner, Lyon, France\n1990, Rock Master, Arco, Italy, winner\n1990, World Cup, winner (tied with Isabelle Patissier from France), Lyon, France\n1990, International Climbing competition, winner\n1992, Rock Master, Arco, Italy, winner\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1984 \u2013 American Alpine Club Underhill Award\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlossary of climbing terms\nList of climbers and mountaineers\nValley Uprising A documentary about the history of climbing in Yosemite Valley, prominently featuring Hill.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Cited texts ===\nHill, Lynn; Child, Greg (2002).

Also not many chicks, which is surprising because it\u2019s a corner (but hey maybe that\u2019s the surprise). Maybe good",
          "Surprise corner was surprisingly hard to find! The arrows point you to the car park, and then it\u2019s actually on the other side of the road. It\u2019s beautiful, but the walk up there from the Bow Trail was more stunning I thought! So it\u2019s definitely worth a walk up there that way",
          "This is a nice place to stop, as it looks out onto Banff Springs hotel, and has some pretty views. There are some informative plaques on the platform, also.",
          "It is fully worth to look for this spot on the road, the views will reward you a million times. We were here in winter but still we had a great view of Banff Hotel, the river and the surrounding mountains. Try pictures from various spots, the light will make the difference.",
          "We hiked from Banff, along the Bow River. The hike itself is a beautiful one, with the river rushing by. When you reach the lookout, the view is spectacular! The rocky mountains, the picturesque hotel with the rapids below. It is quite a site to see!",
          "Getting to Surprise Corner is a simple 15-20 minute walk from town along the Bow River. The lookout itself is a lovely Douglas Fir pine platform overlooking the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel and the Bow River. From this point you can continue on a hike along the Hoodoo Trail or",
          "Nice scenic stop on our tour. Some moderate climbing involved to reach the scenic overlook but the scenery down and across the valley was worth it. Great vistas of lush green mountains, set off by the looming castle like hotel across the valley. Make the trek you will enjoy",
          "Surprise Corner, yes it is located at the corner of the end of Buffalo St. and the beginning of Tunnel Mountain Dr. The view of the hotel was the surprise but the rest was not special. There are some information boards such as the history of the Canadian Railway and some others.",
          "A short stroll from the main street this is a nice place to capture the iconic photo of the Banff Springs Hotel",
          "I expected this just to be a view from the side of the road, but there is a parking lot, a platform that is an overlook and more. I felt the best views are from the roadside rather than the platform. You can see the river down below and the hotel. It is quite a sight.",

          "This is great if you want to get an awesome view of the Fairmont. Personally I preferred coming out on the other side of the river for the excellent view of Bow Falls",
          "It's a nice view but the hotel and river may be seen at many points along the way. Definitely a nice area for photos. I also recommend taking the pedestrian bridge to the opposite side of Bow River to walk along the banks to see Bow Falls. Very pretty.",
          "If you just happen to be coming down that road from tunnel mountain then stop and have a look, but I wouldn\u2019t make a point to go out to Surprise Corner unless you are a big fan of the awful looking Fairmont Hotel. Terrible parking blocked off by a continual flow of tourist buses.",
          "Situated at the bend of the road, this corner is really a surprise corner from the scenic point of view. Spend around 20 minutes and took some picture to capture the beautiful canvass.",
          "We drove to the overlook as it was still fairly brisk in early March to walk there from downtown. On the other hand it owould be a pleasant hike during summer months. It is definitely worth the hike or drive to enjoy the classic view of the valley, blanketed by seemingly",
          "We stumbled on Surprise Corner by accident and happened to get a parking spot in the very small parking lot. Just cross the busy street, and there's a set of steps that takes you up to the viewing platform where you can see the beautiful Banff Springs Hotel and the Bow River",

          "You get full view of Banff spring hotel from an elevated observation deck.you don\u2019t find any sign board.you can view the sulphur mountain in the background and majestic bow river.This is a spot for taking photoes.",
          "Surprise corner is a nice little hike right in town. Not too far and very easy access. Very beautiful setting of the Fairmont Springs Hotel.",
          "A gentle walk, well worth it, not strenuous. The sights and sound along the way are well worth the effort.",
          "We went there late in the afternoon in July. There was no one else at the lookout. It is easy to miss the lookout. When you have parked your car at the lookout parking, turn around and look a bit upward, you will see the lookout across the street. The view of the hotel was",
          "The view across to the Fairmont is spectacular and gives an amazing perspective as to it's sheer grandeur....and the glimpse of the Gondola and it's climb to the top, gives you a taste of the views you will get from Sulphur Mountain.",
          "the best part of my trip to the lake louise area from douglas fir resort a run down area in the town of banff.",
          "Quick stop on our Brewster City tour, and another chance to take in all the magnificent scenery that Banff has to offer. Enjoyed the few minutes we had, and appreciated Mark and Simon's looking out for us to cross the road to get to the lookout. Good job guys!",
          "Nice view of Banff Springs Hotel, especially at dusk or evening when all lit up. Cool view of the Bow River rapids, although you are just above the falls themselves. Easy access from town, in the Tunnel Mountain area.",
          "Great views of the Banff hotel and the river below. Not worth spending a lot of time here, but the view was incredible",
          "It\u2019s worth a quick stop. There is s small parking lot, and a viewing platform. The view is ok. It\u2019s on tunnel mountain drive, not on the location shown.",
          "This is nowhere near one of the best views in the area, but it's easy and convenient to get to and gives you a good look at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, so you may as well take a few minutes to stop there if you're spending time in Banff.",
          "Nice view but what's all the hype. Anyway it's a good way to get a little excercise if you walk there from town. If course you can get a photo of the iconic hotel so that is nice.",
          "Banff and the surrouding area is all about amazing views and this one is free so be sure to see it before you leave. There is a viewing platform reached by a series of steps and an inclined trail so not good for wheelchair access but you can just as easily wander around the",
          "Take a stroll from the commercial downtown Banff up Buffalo street to surprise corner. Well worth your time. Enjoyed viewing the houses along the street as well. Sidewalk not the best, have to switch sides of the street occasionally. Yet, once you arrive, WOW! View of the Bow",
          "Not what we expected to see from this vantage point - spectacular views of the Fairmont Banff Hotel and the wonderful vistas as far as the eye could see",
          "Surprise Corner is well worth a visit as the views of the mountains and Bow River and the HooDoos are simply stunning",
          "The way up the viewpoint is a little annoying, since there is no real pavement, but the view is definitely worth your while.",
          "The parking area is quite small but the walk to the viewing platform is short up a few levels of steps. The view of the Fairmont is reasonable.",
          "This was a very nice surprise...a short drive from downtown Banff with a wonderful view and sounds of the falls...don\u2019t miss out....its free.",
          "This location in Banff will give you awesome views of the Banff Springs Hotel. You can get some great shots here.",
          "This spot is a must-do in Banff and for good reason. Parking is tight but in early-May was was okay. The lookout platform area was a very pleasant spot to sit and have a picnic lunch. What a view!",
          "Visiting Banff is really all about natural beauty, and this viewpoint is a stunner. Great view of the Fairmont, Bow Falls, and the overall landscape. A very easy hike up from the Falls.",
          "surprise corner follows on from the bow river falls and gives a fantastic view of the hotel opposite the view point you can then continue to the bow river trail.",
          "Walk there to take the iconic photo of the Fairmont Banff Spring Hotel. Wonderful views all around to take in.",
          "This is one of the best viewpoints on Tunnel Mountain road. It is a great place to see the Banff Springs Hotel (one of the Banff icons). Be aware the parking lot is tiny! We came in May, had the place to ourselves, and had a wonderful time. This is best reached from tunnel",
          "It was about a 2km walk along the Bow river from downtown. Beautiful walk that I fortunately had time to do a few times. The view of the Banff Springs hotel was fantastic! Highly recommended walk.",
          "Definitely something to do in Banff. The weather was gorgeous. The walk was incredible and the views were even better. Our 10 year old enjoyed it all more than we did. Definitely something we will do again, just to soak it all in.",
          "This is the spot where the popular Banff Springs Hotel picture is taken. It is a short, one stop wonder but what a wonder it is. Gorgeous view from here and easy to get to from town. A viewing platform (not wheelchair accessible) with info plaques is nearby. 30 minutes is",
          "Easy access, great view, clean, well maintained. There is ample parking space. Once at location there is a big viewing platform less than 50 meters from road.",
          "I used Google maps to get to this and it took me through quite a steep trail. Once I got to the area, I realized there was a MUCH easier path to it that was pretty straightforward. The view from this corner is stunning. You'll have to climb up a few stairs to get to it. Going",
          "As you go from the Tunnel Mountain road from town, you get to Surprise Corner where it opens up suddenly and you can see Banff Spring Hotel. It is a postcard picture.",
          "A must see place if you are visiting banff. Beautiful view of the banff spring hotel surrounded by the breathtaking Rockies.",
          "This is the perfect spot to take pictures of the Banff Springs Hotel and the surrounding Canadian Rockies.",
          "Surprise corner gives you an amazing view of the Fairmont as well as the surrounding mountains. Even in the -3 temperatures, people were there taking in the view.",
          "We stayed at the Fairmont and I know I wanted to see this view before I left. We stopped up there and it was snowing, absolutely breathtaking!",
          "During winter this is a spectacular place to get a lasting memory photo. It's a beautiful sight and a nice quiet place to enjoy a wonderful view of the historic hotel.",
          "We thought we might see a different view of the Bow River Falls but really this is simply a view of the Banff Spings Hotel. Nothing much else there but do recommend the Hoo Doos trail that starts from there.",
          "You've got to get a photo of yourself with this iconic landscape in the background. For safety and convenience there's wooden stairs leading up to a large wood platform.",
          "Just a short walk from the parking place you can get to see the Hoodoo and surrounding countryside. we saw a number of deer across the valley.",
          "This is a very handy place for anybody visiting Banff. If you're walking from downtown, the route is a bit sketchy, but if you're driving, there's good parking, and when full, there's overflow parking on the street. You get some stunning views of the Fairmont Banff Springs",
          "A quick and easy place for nice views. Good access to trails for more exploring on foot. Easy parking access too. Go check it out!",
          "Easy to drive up to and a bus stop right by the view point. Great view of the Banff Hotel and mountains on a clearer day. I wouldn't hike up here just for the view but if you can catch a bus or drive up, it's quite nice and easy access.",
          "The surprise Corner parking lot it small and crowded, but if you're patient you'ff find a spot as most people are there to just shoot a couple of selfies and move on. The Banff Hotel and the falls are visible from here and there are some really nice hiking trails along the Bow",
          "I walked up here by myself the day after there had been a heavy and unusually early snowfall. I'd expected it to be rather quiet, and the short walk along the Bow River trail was indeed very peaceful. However, on arriving at the viewing point the surprise for me was that there",
          "This is a very easy location to get to from Banff with pull offs and viewpoints of the Banff Springs Hotel. It snowed 3-4 inches while we were there in September and it was just magical.",
          "I was expecting a lot better view than we actually saw. Better views are to be had elsewhere and whilst worth a visit if passing, certainly not worth a special trip if you are tight for time.",
          "There is a walking trail from the main downtown street at the Banff Avenue side of the foot bridge that goes along the river to an area with a viewing deck where you can get a nice view of the Banff Springs Hotel. You also walk in front of a variety of local houses with great",
          "From this spot there is a great view overlooking the river and the Fairmont hotel in Banff :) Nice to walk here from the town!",
          "Okay, you get a nice view from this spot, but this is an area that is brimming with nice views. I guess you had to be there when the original surprise created the name for this place to understand it. Don't expect to spend more than a couple of minutes here.",
          "Obviously not a surprise now but worth a visit if you want spectacular views of Banff Springs Hotel. There are other aspects of the hotel to photograph however.",
          "we have stopped at the Surprise corner as part of the Brewster tour. the view of the hotel is stunning!",
          "Walking up the trail from the town centre you are beside the river with the falls and hotel to your right. I guess it is only a surprise if you are driving. Yes the view of the hotel is quite good but apart from that there is no 'surprise'.",
          "You don't have to walk far from the main drag on Banff avenue to see this beauty of nature. Just walk straight down Buffalo street and follow the signs that bring you to some fast running water and a pretty lake. Of course the mountains are there too! Many steps are required to",
          "A bit disappointing really. The surprise was a good view of a hotel. Not much else to see really. A bit of a climb up stairs to viewing platform",
          "This is an overlook with nice views, especially of the Fairmont Banff Springs. IT should only take a few minutes. Don't expect too much, or you will sound like you are reciting Peggy Lee's greatest hit. Good photo op.",
          "My family visited this place at the beginning of August 2018. We don\u2019t know why this place is named \u201cSurprise Corner\u201d. When we got there, we felt no surprised at all. It is a place of a col on a hill ridge that is opposite to the famous hotel named \u201cFairmount Hot Spring Hotel\u201d -",
          "The moment when you drove up the road and see the view, it was absolutely a SURPRISE! A big castle in the middle of the mountains and a waterfalls running below, it is such a view to look at! Definitely stop by if you have a chance and it is only 5 minutes away from downtown.",
          "Best of views looking down on Bow River Falls and across at the Banff Springs Hotel. Very convenient 4-5 minute drive from downtown Banff. A must do item on your list!",
          "This spot is reachable on foot using the Banff trails system. It's maybe 15 minutes and a little bit uphill. One could also drive up, I suppose. There's a superb view of the hotel and Bow Falls.",
          "This is literally a very small walk up wooden stairs to a manmade platform to look out at the Fairmont Hotel. Did the Fairmont Hotel pay to make this a \u201csite\u201d in Banff? I truly don\u2019t understand. I mean, if you really want a great pictures of the Fairmont, by all means come here",
          "With the forest fire smoke in the air, it was difficult to see the hotel and mountains on the day we were there. Still, it's a very impressive area in Banff for lookouts on a clear day. Parking is limited in a very small area but most people don't stay long after they get their",
          "Yes you can see the waterfalls or rapids but you will have a much better view from the opposite side of the river/we did both/",
          "Walked here from Central Park in Banff Took some photos of the fairmont hotel We carried on up the hill to do the Tunnel Mountain hike",
          "You get what you hopefully expect. A great photo of the iconic Banff hotel and mountains. Come here for sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after!",
          "At a sharp bend in the road on Tunnel mountain road you will arrive at Surprise corner. Here you will not be disappointed by the view that will unfold for you. The viewing platform has information about the wildlife, trees, Banff springs hotel and the Canadian Pacific Railway",
          "The hotel is impressive looking but once you drive by that's it, so it is a bit anti climatic. If you are running short on time don't bother.",
          "The view on this corner is definitely a surprise. You have a postcard view of the Banff springs hotel, Bow River and the mountain in the background. This location should not be missed when visiting the Canadian Rockies.",
          "If you are doing the Tunnel Mountain Drive it is worth a stop but probably would not go just there. There is not much parking and it is a popular spot",
          "If you have time, you should come visit here. It is just a view of the hotel but you are able to see the falls here too. We parked at the surprise corner parking lot and hiked down from the road instead of the designated hike. It was a beautiful sight.",
          "Visited here as part of our Hoodoo trail hike. Great view over at the hotel and the river. Definitely worth doing.",
          "This is a easy hike, beautiful scenery and shows a beautiful view of the Fairmont hotel. This is easy to do w the hike along w Bow river falls",
          "Beautifull view of the Banff Spring Hotel. Post card setting. best photo opportunities of the hotel. Must see when visiting Banff.",
          "We were cycling from Tunnel Mountain Village 1 campground to Sundance Canyon, saw the \"Surprise Corner\" viewpoint on our map, and stopped there for 10 minutes. The views from above Banff Centre For The Performing Arts and Banff Springs hotel were worth the stop.",
          "Traveled here on our bus tour. Great views at every turn. Just like one sees in the brochures. We rounded the corner and- surprise- wide open view of the valley.",
          "Quick little pit stop a few blocks away from downtown gave us the opportunity to see the Fairmont Banff Springs from afar... it\u2019s the view you always see the hotel pictured. It\u2019s literally a 15 minute stop but worth it if you\u2019re in the area.",
          "Our tour guide asked the coach driver to stop to allow us to take photos of the Fairmont Hotel from across the valley - excellent decision!",
          "Admittedly, the view of the Fairmont Banff Sprints can\u2019t be beat (you can even see the observatory for the Banff Gondola if you look hard enough), but that\u2019s about all there is here. There is a small parking lot across the street, but be sure to look both ways before crossing,",
          "Ok if you want to look at a posh hotel, that's about the sum of Suprise corner, it was a quick stop to get out and stretch there legs but nothing to get excited about",
          "We always take this ride to view the hotel and falls and further on, the Hoodoos. Walk down the hill from the small parking lot to get the best views of the hotel.",
          "I have not read enough about it beforehand and I should have. You go on the little platform and you see the hotel??? Is that this amazing view everybody talks about? And all those tourists coming there bus after bus... Why?",
          "To drive Tunnel Mountain Road is a must, when you are visisting Banff. The old hotel is very impressive",
          "Stopped while taking the Mount Tunnel drive. Rather small parking lot but got in easily enough. Worth walking down the hill for a hundred meters or so to get the variety of views.",
          "Enjoyed coming here..you get a great view of the Banff National Hotel and the Bow River too. The parking lot is easy to get to and the viewing platform is right across the road from it.",
          "Banff is beautiful surrounded by mountain views.. It can be terribly busy and crowded. Make reservations early. The hiking is amazing. I recommend guided hikes and self-guided ones. Travel information and scheduling excursions and shopping can be done at the travel store. Plan",
          "What a lovely spot. Perfect view of the valley, the river, the Springs, and even the Rimrock. There\u2019s a spot to pull over and get some great shots.",
          "Many view points along the way and all are worth checking out. Actually Banff National park is so beautiful it is hard to go wrong stopping anywhere and admiring the mountains and views.",
          "Surprise Corner is the best location get a great photo of the Fairmont Banff Springs. I like the viewing area by the bend in the road with the trees and rocks rather than the woody viewing platform above. This is a good photo op location for anyone staying at the hotel and a",
          "You get a good panoramic view of Fairmont hotel and surrounding mountains but only limited view of Bow River below. You need to travel to the opposite side of the river to get a proper view of the Bow Falls",
          "Not much to do here but check out the scenery; but if you have the time would definitely spot by. Enjoyed watching the power of the river beneath the canyon",
          "You can get there via car, or hike - and we hiked the 1.2 km from the main street. It was a nice, quiet walk along the river, and we were able to see some wildlife along the way! Beautiful view!",
          "As we stayed at the Banff Springs Hotel, this location offered an exceptional photo opportunity as the view from here combines a great outlook over Bow Cascades and the magnificent Hotel",
          "Surprise corner was named after a remark from the Queen many years ago, and is indeed a very pleasant surprise. We walked up the riverside path, bumped into a deer on the way, then did the last bit along the road as the old path is closed as unsafe. Several viewing spots, the",
          "Just a quick trip off Banff Ave, you'll find this sightseeing gem! The view facing the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel and Sulphur mountain is breathtaking. Below is the bow river/bow falls area! This is a must stop lovstion. Parking is limited, so park in the offered lots in Banff",
          "We took a walk one afternoon from the middle of Banff up the road to Surprise Corner and happened to be there just before sunset. The view was great and we had an awesome time strolling around some of the trails down by the water as well. Close by near the footbridge, we saw an",
          "We joined a local tour and it was one of the sightseeing spots. The surprise view was the castle which was a hotel in itself. Other than that it was all snowy white trees as we went there in winter. I personally think that you will find better views if you hike the Hoodoos",
          "Saw this on a tour and what a view! Lovely! Like everywhere else this area is spotlessly clean. Perfect place to take photos.",
          "Just beautiful! It does take you by surprise, there is a parking lot where you can stop and take pictures or you can stop along the road as well. It's beautiful in winter/summer/morning/evening, there's no bad photos as such.",
          "Just amazing ! The snow made it extra magical to visit. Although it was extremely cold it was definitely worth braving it to see this.",
          "At the foot bridge (Banff Avenue side of bridge), take a left on river trail. Peaceful walk with benches for sitting and viewing the Bow River. The trail ends where it connects to the road going to the Banff Center. From that point, take a right onto road and continue walking.",
          "We walked from in town on the roadway on the way up (don\u2019t recommend), avoid this if you can as the footing on the side of the road is uneven in places, let alone being visible to oncoming traffic. Once there the viewing platform is good however very slippery when wet and if",
          "We walked the trail up from the town, which was fairly straight forward, a few stairs and steeper parts but quite pleasant. Gives you a nice view across to the Fairmont",
          "The best view of Fairmont Banff, the historic , whimsical, eerie Chateau style hotel, is not from the hotel ground, but from Surprise Corner, that can be accessed easily from downtown Banff. I would still recommend to visit the Fairmont Banff Springs. It is more intriguing than",
          "A good spot to get an overview of the Banff Springs Lodge and Bow Falls. Expect a crowded parking lot in summer but ok in winter",
          "You come around a corner and there it is - the Banff Springs Hotel Fairmont. It is rather gothic and is built backwards as the builders looked at the blue print the wrong way around so the kitchen staff have the best sights to look at while they work. Steeply priced to stay",
          "Traveled to this site with a group of 35 people. Wish we had more time at this stop as there was an abundant amount of trails to be explored. Traveled there in winter so there was a lot a snow on the ground which made footing an issue in spots. Took some great photos.",
          ".. you can walk here from Downtown Banff in around 20-25 minutes. The view across the frozen Bow river to Banff Springs iconic hotel is fabulous and also back towards the town. Well recommended to get some fresh air.",
          "Surprise view is surrounded by trees so there is no view unless you want to see a hotel which we didn\u2019t. Go on the other side of the river and see the views from the viewpoint above the Falls, that is stunning.",
          "On the outskirts of town, there is a lookout a called Surprise Corner with great views of the Banff Springs Hotel nestled in the mountains... and we saw a deer!",
          "A decent place to stop to catch a good view of the hotel but not for much else. Don't get hit by a car.",
          "A definite stop on your way out! \ud83d\udc4dThe view is amazing and well worth the stop. There is even a great hiking trail to follow.",
          "Great views of \"The Castle\" or Banff Springs Hotel and Bow Falls. There is a lovely walk down along the river. The trail begins at the back end of the parking lot. In winter, you might want some \"yak traks\" or something to give you some grip on the first hill going down...can",
          "This is a small viewing platform with very limited parking which creates a very frustrating scenario. There were tourists filling the road as we tried to get into the car park (room for about a dozen vehicles) and when we finally got parked up after waiting for someone else to",
          "Beautiful view of the Fairmont. There was light snow when we visited but the views from the platform were great",
          "Great view of the Banff Springs hotel, but very limited parking. If you follow the hoodoo trail you can walk down to the Bow River where you will have much nicer views of the mountains. We walked down a long way, made for a nice walk.",
          "There could be a variety of surprises at this lovely spot near the Banff Centre where Buffalo Street and Tunnel Mountain Drive meet. The first surprise is the gorgeous views of the Fairmont Banff Springs. There aren't a lot of places in Banff to get such a great view of this",
          "We walked here to see what the surprise is and it is a beautiful view of the fancy hotel that we had just visited. Worth stopping to see it.",
          "OK, so it is a lovely view. But there are so many better views in the area. Drive half way up to Stoney Squaw trailhead for example (up the Norquay Avenue past the turns for the highway), ten times and more the view is on offer.",
          "Sturdy platform for panoramic views of Bow Falls and the Banff Springs Hotel. Very busy, limited parking, tourists in the street; oblivious of traffic. Worth a few minutes.",
          "An attraction for many photographers from which the classic shots of the Hotel can be taken. Just a short drive out of Banff with free but severely limited parking",
          "A Canadian Icon. Just a quick stop. Park your car, walk across the road take a few picture and marvel at how massive the Banff Springs Hotel is. Why buy the postcard when you can get the picture?",
          "We drove past this on our way out of Banff, but it was gorgeous to see the hotel surrounded by snow covered trees. If you want the picture you see so often on the internet, it's a must go.",
          "We were told by the guide at the Information Centre that we'd have to take the road to find out. Hint...look at the photo. We did take Tunnel Mountain Road to look for wildlife and we didn't see a single animal! I was very surprised!",
          "If you are traveling to Banff, this is an absolute must-see. This is what comes to mind when I think of Banff. It doesn't take much time, parking is free, and there are numerous look-outs where you can snap some incredible pics. Would highly recommend.",
          "Stunning views of the beautiful landscape, you can see the Fairmont Springs hotel and several different peaks as well as the river flowing through. There is a small parking area and there are several steps up to the official look out deck but it's worth the stop. Wonderful.",
          "A quick turn around the corner opens up in the most spectacular view of the Fairmon Banff Springs Hotel in its entirety. Stories abound about the original structure and builder. Boasting more than 750 rooms, it's guaranteed anyone staying there will get lost!",
          "Take the road out of Banff to surprise corner with lovely views of the river and Fairmont hotel across the river. There is a car park but very busy and quite a few coach trips stop there. If you carry on the drive you with pas quite a lot of view points as well as tunnel",
          "What a view. From afar it looks amazing. But up close, you would not believe. It's a real life castle complete with men in their Scottish attire. Wow, this hotel! It's a must on anyones list to visit, play golf, or see some great wildlife. (Don't miss the other side of the",
          "A MUST! Get there for free, lovely backdrop, breathtaking. Definitely a spot you shouldn't miss in Banff. Just cross your fingers that when you get there, there won't be a group tour in a bus. There are some inconsiderate people who doesn't care if they will block you with the",
          "looked beautiful with History behind this building , very nice location in between mountains. Did not have enough time to visit inside",
          "Short distance from downtown, if you want to capture the famous Fairmont hotel with mountains in the background this would be a perfect location to capture it. A nice spot while driving through the mountains and its on the way to tunnel mountain drive.",
          "Hardly a surprise, but a short drive from the centre of Banff to a small carpark that accesses this elevated viewing platform. A walk along the roadside also avails view of the famous Fairmont Banff Springs hotel, but I suppose the surprise was the view of Bow River & Falls. A",
          "The parking lot is small, and there are a few spots up where you can park on the side of the road. You can walk up to a platform for views of the Fairmont Banff Springs across the Bow River -- stay on the platform and stairs to protect roots of the Douglas firs. There are some",
          "This viewpoint is in a mountain overlooking the Banff hotel and the falls. It's a short distance from the road bend. Near the bend there's a small free parking, which is a short distance from the viewing terrace. Need to climb some steps to rach the terrace (and to cross the",
          "I found the signage hard to figure out, but we walked both sides of the river. I felt a bit unsafe walking on the mountain road right next to the drop off to the river. Very pretty. We walked up to it form our hotel.",
          "A great view point offering a spectacular view of the Banff Springs Hotel. Can get crowded depending on the time of day visited.",
          "This is the place to go if you want a photo that includes the mountains and the grand Fairmont Hotel - plus Bow Falls below if you stand at the right spot. A photographer's dream!",
          "What I found most interesting about the Surprise Corner was actually the architecture of the lookout, and the posted signage about the history and the trees. There's not a lot to see here, and it can get quite busy with the tour buses stopping here. We parked at the tiny parking",
          "The platform across the street was a great idea, the parking lot was a little small for a busy holiday weekend. The Hotel is quite the grand dame and is a wonderful reminder of the grandeur of yesteryear.",
          "Perfect location to take photos of Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. The Tunnel Drive takes you to this place. Not much of parking space, may have to wait a bit or park on the street. Care is needed since it is located on a steep bend. The view of the Fairmont is spectacular.",
          "Be careful or you will drive right by this place. There is limited parking here so just be aware of this. The lookout looks to be newly renovated and offers a spectacular view of the Bow River valley area and a view of the Banff Springs hotel. The Bow River trail passes by this",
          "Not sure unless you are staying at the Banff Springs Fairmont Hotel and want to take a picture of it from a distance why you would even stop. It's nice place to stretch your legs.",

          "If you take the wonderful drive along Tunnel Mountain Road, right at the corner is Surprise Corner, where you can park (although parking is limited and some inconsiderate person parked their motor home right behind us in the little lot- blocking us in) and either take a wooden",
          "Interesting spot to observe the hotel and river ... we were not so lucky in that the BC fire smoke ravaged the area putting a damper on great views ... also, the morning/early afternoon should be best for viewing and photos. Parking is limited but appears to open up as this is",
          "Take tunnel drive to the Surprise location. Parking is minimal - you may have to wait a bit or park on the street. The view of the fairmont is spectacular. Photo opportunities are best in the mornings on sunny days.",

          "We hiked from Surprise Corner to Hoodoos. We did miss a turn and ended up on a longer, more challenging path. Not all of the splits are well marked. The hike, as intended , is a moderate hike.",
          "This spot has a great panoramic view of the Banff Springs Hotel and surrounding area. Probably worth the short climb to the upper viewing area.",
          "Unfortunately this week the smoke from British Columbia is quite heavy and visibility is limited, however the Bow River is quite impressive as it is less than 100 yes away and beyond that the Fairmont about a quarter of a mile distant raises an iconic architectural facade.",
          "The lookout itself is great if you want a nice view of the hotel. The river below however can't be seen from here BUT there are locations nearby where you can see it and take photos. The walk along the river to get from town to surprise corner is great. Note that there's a short",
          "excellent view of the hotel busy but not crazy. Also walked down street a bit and saw bow falls from above",

          "Surprise Corner offer's what I believe to be the Best View of the Banff Springs Hotel. All times of the year you can see the Castle on the Mountain. There is no public restrooms here, but there is limited parking. It is a easy walk as well either from the Convention Centre or",
          "This is where all the tourists stop for a beautiful view of the Banff Springs Hotel, rising majestically from the forest overlooking the Bow River. There are a couple of different viewpoints and they make wonderful photos. Parking is quite good.",

          "Hard to find parking but this one gives you the classic view of this majestic hotel. People do not usually stay long so give the little parking lot a try,",
          "Good views of the iconic hotel only Cannot see bow falls from here Not sure why it is rated so highly Frankly disappointed Go to Bow falls instead with ample parking",
          "Breathtaking view of the mountain and the old hotel amidst the pine trees. I have been wondering where did the pictures taken of such magnificent scene. Now i know it is here. A must-see place for all Banff visitor.",

          "Just a minute outside of town but a stunning perspective looking at the Banff Springs hotel. It looks like something out of a fairytale. Worth going to check out.",
          "We drove through on a buss tour with a guy named Habib. He was excellent at telling us all about the Mt and how it got it's name. We stopped at a couple spots for photo's for 10 to 15 minutes.",
          "Well worth the walk to see the surprise of the Banff pop up into view. Grab your coat and just go exploring. not too far to walk to the town centre where there are heaps of places of interest, including art gallerys, cafe's etc.",
          "Best location in town to view the Fairmont Hotel. The Falls are across the road but a difficult view from the Surprise corner viewing stand. You need to go back to town and cross the river to get a good view of the Falls and pictures. But the immensity of the Fairmont Hotel is",
          "We love stopping here every visit to take pictures. There is a platform across the street that you can climb up to take pictures but the view is better along the road. Beautiful mountains, Bow River and Banff Springs Hotel in background!",
          "But that is about it. I wouldn't add it to an itinerary, but if you happen to walk/drive past it, it can't hurt to stop and take a peak",
          "This is excellent view point of Fairmont Banff Spring Hotel. I went all the way to bottom (it is difficult and dangerous to do so ) . From this side, it is hard to see Bow Fall. When I claimed up, I sawed a snake which is very close to me.",
          "A must visit if you wish to have a goid view point of the castle lookalike hotel. You can either walk or drive up here. Walking up here is easy.",

          "I wouldn't go out of my way to see this. It really is what the pictures show it is and there's nothing more. If you are around the area though, it's an easy stop. There's parking and it's a 2 minute walk to the lookout",
          "Great view of the Fairmont. Only for the sure footed wearing good shoes, as quite steep with cliffs if you leave the pavement. You can't get a great view of the falls from here. Recommended, but not essential for your Banff trip.",
          "Walked there from the Fairmont Banff Springs as had been told that this was the best view of the hotel. It was a picture postcard setting. Not to be missed!",
          "We got to see this only because our daughter had discovered it and made sure we visited it. It has a wonderful view of Bow Valley and the perfect place for pictures of the Banff Springs Hotel.",
          "You must go down this Road. A lot of gorgeous territory and a good view of the Chauteau! Gorgeous and beautiful!",
          "We were leaving and realized that we hadn't seen Surprise Corner, which we could see from our room at the Fairmont Banff. It was raining and we were disappointed. Then the valet said he would drive us up so we could take a picture and take us back to the hotel. It was",
          "I would definitely recommend this hike it has a nice view of the Banff Springs Hotel. Good for kids too.",

          "This spot has a fine view of the historic Fairmont Hotel. If you are staying in the hotel it is a good memory photo opportunity, if not there are much nicer areas to visit in Banff.",
          "Visting Banff while on a business trip to Calgary and had heard that we should stop here for some great views. We thought it was going to be tricky to find, but actually there are signs from Banff directing you to Tunnel Mountain Road and the parking lot. Just be careful",
          "We stayed at the Fairmont Banff Springs and enjoyed the 20 minute walk to see the property from this angle. Lovely photo spot",
          "Very easy to drive. A parking lot is available there and we can walk to a deck with bench to nice picture. It is not a simple roadside photo spot. You can park safely and enjoy a moment on the viewing deck",
          "Lovely area but have to go up quite a few steps to photo opportunity. Small area to park and on a steep bend, care needed and not for small children.",
          "Absolutely a must-see location. You really want to go in the morning though if you want good shots of the hotel in the distance. You'll also want to bring a long lens (ie 200-400mm) and a tripod if you plan to shoot the hotel. The hoodoos are something to see, and you can",
          "Stopped and took a walk up a boardwalk to get really nice pictures of Banff Springs Hotel. Be careful crossing street as it is quite a busy place.",
          "this is really a nice lookout and certainly worth the 5 min drive from town to visit. There is a car park 2 mins from the lookout point and it certainly provides a very scenic view of the Fairmont Hotel and the Bow River.",

          "This little corner is at a bend in the road and gives a wonderful view over the valley and the Banff Springs Hotel. Get there early because the car park fills up quickly.",
          "A combination of paths and walking by the side of the road leads to a gorgeous view of the bow falls and the fairmont chateaux in the distance. You may however choose to walk off the beaten path following a very frail trail clinging to the side of a cliff for better views but",
          "A perfect opportunity to take a photo of the world renowned Fairmont Springs . A quick walk or drive from the center of Banff takes you to the look out point.",

          "Surprise Corner is on Tunnel Mountain Road, a 9 kilometer scenic drive that begins and ends in the Town of Banff. You turn the corner and (surprise!) there is a great view of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel and, below it, the Bow River and Bow Falls. There is limited parking",
          "My wife and I visited the Banf NP ara in July 2011. We enjoyed the Banff Sightseeing Tram ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain where we had a wonderful view of downtown Banff, Bow River and Bow Falls, and the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel. Take the Tunnel Mountain Road for an",

          "If you've already hired a car or you have access to transportation then it's worth spending the time to go check it out. Surprise corner is only 10min from the main street in Banff, the view is nice & it's a great spot to check out the Banff Springs hotel.",
          "We were on a tour and your tour guide surprised us all with surprise corner. It had beautiful scenery and you got a good view of the hotel.",
          "First of all, the view is amazing. The trail was closed because of the -30 degree weather and the ice, so you couldn't go up to the platform. There is a little ledge thing to stand on that offers a good view of the Fairmont hotel and some mountains. In the cold weather, you",
          "Its just another point, nothing really great about the point, If you are in rush simply skip this spot.",
          "It is, what it is. A quick stop with a wonderful view of an Iconic building. The Parking lot is small, but i was able to get a spot very easily. I visited on a weekday in Mid-September. Mornings have better views, and the Viewpoint is a nice place for a quick picture. Here it",
          "I was part of a tour that travelled to Surprise Corner. What a great view we had of the Rimrock here. The landscape is just surreal. So much to take in and not enough time.",
          "Beautiful views of the Fairmont, but even nicer views of nature. I got some good pictures of the Fairmont, but seeing the nature in winter with snow on the trees, steam coming up from the river water, with the sun shining with blue skies was a sight to behold. It was a",
          "A good place to see the hotel plus the bow fall, if you want to call it a \"fall\". Easy to get there.",
          "Beautiful stop up Tunnel Mountain Road. This Road is winding and a bit longer than expected. However it brought us to our hotel at the top. It's a good drive but go slow. Stop at the viewing spot and park. Walk across to steps that lead up to platform for gorgeous views.",
          "Beautiful! I took so many pictures. I just can't grasp how beautiful this was. The next time I visit, I definitely want to come back and possibly stay there!",
          "Walked the Bow Falls trail from Banff Avenue, easy sloping walk opening to a breathtaking view of the Banff Springs Hotel.",
          "The view of the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel at Surprise Corner is worth the minimal effort. It's easy to get to on the Tunnel Mountain Road. It's a postcard worthy photo!",
          "Great spot to photograph the Banff Springs Hotel against the Rockies. Just a short drive or steepish walk up from downtown Banff, this makes a nice excursionf or photo enthusiasts. Don't miss the Bow River rushing below you towards the Bow Falls.",

          "I parked here and walked a trail down to the rivers edge. It's a nice quick stop, but not all that scenic considering there's so much more to see and do within an hour radius.",
          "We walked along the side of the river for as far as we could, we saw the hotel and the small rapids.",
          "This is the place to take the iconic photo shot of Banff Spring Hotel, there is a small car park, and you cross the road to an elevated section. Best to go in the morning for the sun to be in the right direction",
          "You can drive or walk to Surprise Corner. They have a parking lot there and the view is just across the road. It's basically a bunch of steps up to a platform overlooking the Bow River and the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. Nice views.",
          "We went there twice. First time it was foggy and we could not see anything. The good thing is that we hiked there along the Bow river from downtown so the hike itself was worth it. The second time we drove in our way out and sure enough without the fog it is very pretty. I",
          "A large viewing deck of the Banff Springs Hotel is available at the roadside, but make the little trek down to the river. A bit of sandy beach, nice flat rocks suitable for sunning oneself, and the gurgle of the river to complete the experience. Great spot for a little picnic.",
          "Our Banff hotel was located on Tunnel Mountain, so this route was taken out of necessity. It was so darn scenic that we returned the next day to enjoy the many trails that intersect the road and the views from the road itself, which include a nice overlook view of the famous",
          "There is only a small parking lot here which, if there is a tourist coach already there, makes parking difficult. Views of the hotel are rather restricted by trees, but the view of the Bow Falls is stunning because it is possible to see their whole length if you stand on the top",
          "Take a sharp corner and Surprise you see a magnificent view of the Banff Springs Hotel! The Banff Springs Hotel is a luxury hotel that was built during the 19th century as one of Canada's grand railway hotels, being constructed in Scottish Baronial style and located in Banff",

          "My wife and I visited this viewpoint (11/09) as part of a tour of the Banff area. Our coach dropped us off at the small parking lot and having pressed the button to activate the warning light to safely allow us to use the zebra crossing, we climbed up a few steps to a viewing",

          "If you have a car, this is where you should go for a good photo of Banff Springs Hotel. You will get the iconic view that you have seen on postcards. If you visited the hotel and realized you could not get a good photo, head back in to Banff and make a right at the CIBC bank.",
          "Surprise Corner has a great view of the hotel and the Bow River just above the falls. It's only about 15-20 minute walk from either town or the Banff Springs Hotel so worth the walk especially if you're hiking anyway but there's nothing else there.",

          "This is another spot to take pictures of the bow falls. You could take pictures of the falls with the Fairmont in the back ground. Pretty cool and definitely worth a quick stop. Also take a look of the number of tour buses stopping at the bow falls.",
          "Wanted just the perfect picture of the castle in the sky. Must be careful to walk on the side of the road which has a little bit of space. Pull out good for pedestrians but not for busses. On the walk up we had an interesting stop at the cemetery to look at the tombstones of",

          "Fist stop on our trip from Banff to Calgary. Viewing platform is very accessible (and hence is used by the coach parties), but a clamber down the rocks to the rivers edge is also very worthwhile. Recommend continuing out along Tunnel road and stopping at the Hoodoos lookout",
          "You have to hike down a steep trail to the surprise corner and you should wear proper footwear. The view of the Fairmont Banff Spring hotel is nice, but those afraid of height may not find it worthwhile.",
          "We made our way to Surprise Corner as we were told about the beautiful views there. We are very glad we went as the views of the falls and the Fairmont in the background are just mesmerizing. There are plenty of parking spaces and once again, one of the most underrated places to",
          "Ever wonder where to go to get that shot of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel? Well, a short drive to Surprise Corner, and a climb up a bunch of stairs will demonstrate the answer. It's only about a 5 minute visit - enough to get the shot and go. Parking is available but",
          "We did not have a car and made the walk up the hill to this viewpoint.... and it was worth every step!",
          "Once again the views are amazing and snow capped mountains in the back ground. There is 360 degrees of scenery it hard to know what to photograph. Wasn't over crowded and a relaxing place to visit soloe or with family.",
          "Excellent views of the hotel, looks beautiful with all the trees around it. It certainly takes your breath away",
          "Nice viewing point giving great views of Banff Springs Hotel. Worth stopping off for 5 minutes. It's a shame the Bow Valley pathway joins a busy road to reach this point.",
          "See the river from way up high. Nice view. Cross the road and take a photo with the castle in the background.",
          "You get a wonderful view of the Banff springs hotel here which is worth the walk alone. There are also some interesting little trails down to the river's edge. It's not that far from the town centre and very well signposted.",
          "From Fairmont Banff springs hotel, There is a trail to bow falls, and wonder where those postcard took the picture of the hotel? It is the Surprise Corner, which is from the other side of the river. It gives a full view of the hotel, that imo, can be creepy and austere when",
          "It is literally a corner in a road, but it's worth a stop. The view across Banff is spectacular. There is a specially built up viewing point and you can walk onto the hillside. Beware of the buses that stop there with a pile of tourists, but if you wait for a few minutes they",
          "We walked from downtown Banff to Surprise Corners along the river. Very nice walk. Peaceful and quiet. It is a bit uphill right before the end by Surprise Corners. If you do not want to walk from town there is a parking lot at Surprise Corners. Nice view across the river of",
          "What a fantastic area to vis it and see so many sites. With a great guide Nichol who really enthralled us with the stories and pictures",
          "taking the road out of banff suprise corner is the best place to get a view of the fairmont hotel small car park and usually loads of tourists stop off here including coaches but worth a photo stop",
          "Great little stop with parking about 100m away. The view is great, just like in the photo but the view is usually better. The weather in the photo someone supplied here is borderline rainy. This is a stop I sometimes include while leading my private landscape photography",
          "There's a viewing platform from which to take in the alternative view of the Banff Springs Hotel nestled in the hillside. But you actually get a better photo opportunity from slightly farther down the road - there's a lay-by that offers a similar view but from which you can also",
          "This is very close to town and several trail heads are located here. Get a view of the Banff Springs Hotel and Bow Falls here or hike to the Hoo Doos.",
          "Drive up from buffalo st, its right before the bridge 2 min up the hill..surprise. Good view of hotel and river",
          "What a great spot to get in this fabulous view. There is a small packing lot right across the street. Definitely stop and get a photo.",
          "We came here on our first day after arriving in Canada. I love the way that places are named so descriptively and this is a fine example. Coming along the river and reaching the bend and the beautiful view is just that - a surprise.",

          "Walked up to Surprise Corner on a lovely sunny day. We walked along the river from the town, it was beautiful. The views when we got their were wonderful",
          "It's a great place to drive by and even stop at and explore, but I wouldn't plan for more than an hour here.",
          "While it is simply a stop along the road, it is one that truly deserves a moment of your time. There is a small amount of parking and it can fill up quickly especially in the afternoon and early evening. You walk up a small flight of stairs and when look out you get a",
          "It is right behind Banff Fairmont Spring Hotel so it is a perfect picture spot with Fairmont Hotel at the background.",
          "walked the pathway from town to the surprise corner to see the waterfalls and the fairmont springs hotel. nice walk, but near end must use the road as the cliff is unsafe. nice views of the river. recognised the view used in the revenant movie.",
          "Went before 8AM and got some great shots back at the Fairmont. Lots of selfies also. Watch yourself on the road!!!",
          "Great views of the Banff Spring hotel from across the river. Cross the road and take the steps to the look off on the top. One can also trek down to the river.",

          "This is the best view I think anyway, of the Banff Spring Hotel. Between forest and mountains it is quite the photo op.",
          "This viewing area provides an excellent view of the Banff Springs Hotel across the Bow river. That's pretty much it. There are also some information boards about the area/hotel. There is a small parking lot across the street and a space that I presume can be used for parking on",
          "We walked here from the main city street and it was a nice view of the hotel. nothing too special just a good lookout.",
          "Surprise corner is really just an opportunity to take a photo of the Banff Spring Hotel nestled between the mountains and the Bow River.",
          "I was coming back from hiking Tunnel Mountain and stumbled on the sign reading \"surprise corner\". I had no idea what that was and asked a local who was walking by, she told me \"turn around and be surprised\". I look out and saw what was the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, which is",
          "It's nothing much but a scene that you can see in many postcard in Banff shooting the view of Banff Spring Hotel surrounded by Mountains. It's beautiful but only one shoot but go. If you have spare time, it is ok to visit. If you are rush, you can skip this.",
          "Never knew this spot exisited until recently. Beautiful vista for taking photographs. Hiking area in the vicinity. Parking is limited.",
          "We stop here every time we're in Banff. It's the best view of the Fairmont Banff Springs and surrounding woods. You can't beat it.",
          "Great views from this corner. An easy walk from downtown, it is a worthwhile visit. An observation deck also provides info on local flora and fauna.",
          "This point is just a 5 minute drive away from Banff Avenue which allows for a great view of the iconic Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel.",
          "Well worth the short trip from town. Amazing views of the Fairmont hotel and surrounding scenery. Great viewing infrastructure. Highly recommended.",

          "You get a very nice view of The Fairmont Banff Springs. After spending 2 nights there it was good to see from this corner. Good views of the Bow River and the valley too.",
          "We had a little bit of spare time between other excursions while in Banff so took a quick drive up from the village to Surprise Corner. It was well worth it! The views down the gorge to the Bow Falls and across to the Banff Springs hotel/mountains were stunning. As a nice little",
          "Lovely views -easy walk up to the viewpoint too. Don't forget the camera. Take water if it's a warm day as there are no stores up there.",
          "Located on Tunnel Mountain; I have walked and driven to Surprise Corner several times, each time I have encountered wildlife - often elk - so if driving PLEASE go slowly! From the viewing point you get the postcard view of the Banff Springs Hotel, you can hear the rush of Bow",
          "We were amazed by the breath taking view from this surprise spot. We did love looking down at Banff Springs and across at the mountains. It was a very clear day and so we were fortunate to get the full effect. This is a great ride and so easy and accessible from Banff. Hope",
          "Surprise corner is always on my list when showing friends and family around this amazing mountain town of Banff. It s a great vantage point to view the Fairmont Banff Springs from the outside as well as Bow Falls!",
          "This is a must see/go location. Banff Springs across the valley. Good photo opportunity. Nice 15 minute walk from downtown or 2 minute drive.",
          "The surprise corner was nothing but special! It's a great spot for photos with the mountains, bow river and the hotel in the background. I also got lucky enough to see a mule deer hanging around the site as well. The parking is a bit scarce but it is still a great spot to stop",
          "Nice drive up to a beautful view of mountains and the Banff Springs Hotel. You can park in the small parking lot, walk along the road to a clearing or go up a few stairs to the viewing platform. Around the area are a few short trails going down by the river and falls and a",
          "This is the exact spot that the architect of the hotel sat and looked at the spot while trying to get a feel from nature of what to build. The new upper stairs/platform have a great postcard view of the hotel but the path beside the road leads to another great spot for photos",
          "The beautiful castle-like Banff Springs Hotel is the highlight of this viewpoint. It's called \"Surprise Corner\" because the hotel is not visible until you arrive at the curve in the road.. Besides the hotel, Bow Falls is visible from above, and Sulphur Mountain is the backdrop",
          "This can be one of the most peaceful and relaxing places ever. The view is just mesmerizing and its perfect for pictures.",
          "We stopped at Surprise corner just before we headed home. Not a surprise because we had expected it from online pictures. It's a nice place to take photos of Fairmont Banff Spring Hotel.",
          "I followed the snow covered path along the river and then walked up the side of the road to the view point. Very nice view of the Fairmont Banff Springs.",
          "This is called surprise corner because when driving it turns into a straight 90 degree angle turn on the bend. They have a lookout area that was being refurbished with all new wood so we could not get high up but still at road level there was still lots of picturesque views of",
          "We were advised to go up to Surprise Corner after walking up there we found it closed off and couldn't see much from bellow It was a nice walk though so not all was lost",
          "This a great place to stop by for a picture. If you're in Banff, and have some time to explore. I would recommend making a quick stop for a picture.",
          "about a 30 minute walk from the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel to arrive at the spot where most pictures of the hotel are taken. at least that's what we were told by the staff. not much else to say, it's really nothing more than a spot that provides great views of the hotel.",
          "We absolutely love the Banff Springs Hotel. It is our favorite hotel in the world to wander through, and it has such history. We came to this corner based on the reviews from this site. It gave us a view of the hotel we had never seen, before. We got a number of fantastic",
          "We walked form downtown to that point about 2.5kms aprox. Snow everywhere, lots of wind. When we arrived to this point, we didn't care about the sold wind, everything was about the sight, just incredible. A must do.",
          "Best view of the hotel. And less than 5 min drive from town. Lets hope you don't get blocked in by a bus driver who doesn't care where he parks!!",
          "Best spot to admire the beauty of Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. The viewing spot was closed for the winter, but you can take a short walk to the other picture perfect spot. We are so glad we took the time to drive up in this area before leaving Banff and heading to Lake",
          "This is one of the most beautiful senic roads we traveled. The Waterton Hotel is wonderful to look at very time you take the road.",
          "This lookout point provides a wonderful view of the Fairmont Banff Springs- although the walking bridge appeared closed for the season, the view from the road (with a pull off area) was fantastic. It is especially worth the visit if you are staying at the Fairmont.",
          "One of the great views in Canada. What a atmosphere. Show your world wide friends. Walk over to the hotel, and ramble through. Even with your dog on a leash. Staff very friendly.",
          "Its a very busy viewing location, as coaches use it as well as cars, so be vigilant with young children as well as the elderly. The view on a clear day is stunning",
          "We had walked to this spot on the other side of the river. I wasn't expecting to love the overlook but we went and I enjoyed it.",
          "Make sure you take a photo of Banff fairmount springs hotel at surprise corner then get in a taxi and visit the hotel, amazing",
          "Great place for a short hike up or even faster drive! Decent views of the fairmont and the mountains in the summer and winter.",
          "A short drive from Banff, following the map, instructions from the Visitor Centre or any other guiding help, the famous Surprise Corner is really a parking lot from where, one can cross the street and go up a few steps on a viewing point. In my opinion, it is well worth taking",
          "A quick stop with an amazing view of Banff Springs. Little boardwalk platform for the best shots. Don't forget to set your smart phone to PANO, worth it.",
          "Great view of the Banff Springs Hotel and the Bow River Falls. Save and easy too take photos from the viewing platform. Parking off the road.",
          "very simple to explain. its a view of banff springs hotel. parking is minimal. gets crowded but they don't stay long. there are a couple trails for hiking actually near by. one is at the back of the parking lot and it will take you down to bow river. the other is down the road",
          "Wonderfully built deck elevates you above the river and roadway to offer an awesome view of the historical structure.",
          "It is a point to view the Bow fall and river, also the historical hotel. A well established platform is here, so that everyone can take good photo easily. Yet the overall view is just average.",
          "I knew it was coming, but it was still enchanting! Seeing it up close is really breathtaking, there's so much architectural detail. Love this place and wedding photos here for sure.",
          "The tour coach pulled up and we got out to climb the 20 or so steps up to the viewing point. From there, great view of the one of the oldest hotels in the Rockies could be seen. It's often called the 'castle in the mountains' and we can see why!",
          "Great spot to get a photo of the Banff Fairmont Hotel, where it looks like a castle sitting in a forest. Would be nice spot at sunrise, with a red sky.",
          "Best view in the Rockies!! And there was even a couple of Adirondack's to rest in, to prolong the time before getting back in the car!",
          "This is a nice spot to photograph the Fairmont Banff Castle; however, requires walking along busy road. Viewpoint is on a sharp corner with little warning of coming traffic, thus the name surprise corner. Please be careful!",
          "After the magnificent scenery in the Rockies we felt that this Corner didn't deserve any special mention!",
          "Surprise corner is at the bend in the road en route to The Banff Center for the Arts. Yes there is a view, and good information about natural history, but what's the surprise?!",
          "Across the falls from the Bow falls site. watch for signs in town as this is a must see location. Platform to take pictures from is great.",
          "this place is over qualify. from there you can hear the noise of the falls but to watch them you must go to the other side of the river",
          "We were just cruising along looking for elk, etc on Tunnel Mountain Road and came across the surprise. What a beautiful spot and photo op. If you just want a quick photo there is a small pullout before the parking area (see photo). Very cool and unexpected for us, even on a",
          "We got there early (around 9am) before the tour buses and had a short window of time to take photographs and enjoy the scenery and views. However, shortly after we arrived, tour buses with lots of Asian tourists inundated our peace and quiet. They talked loudly and stood",
          "Surprise corner was to e a bit of a let down as I don't really know what I was supposed to be surprised by.The car park for the lookout was on a dangerous corner and I was slightly on edge trying to cross. I my view not worth the detour.",
          "We enjoyed our brief stop here at Surprise Corner which is amazingly picturesque. There is an absolute fantastic view of the Banff Springs Hotel with Sulphur Mountain in the background and Bow Falls. We hope to come back to the Rockies just to spend more time at places such as",
          "Probably the best view of the hotel. Nice built up walkway but quite a few steps to climb. Some educational signs telling about the trees in the area.",
          "Had to stop and take the iconic photo. Small car park with a viewing platform across the road. To get the real shot need to walk back down the road a little way, the spot is marked. View of Fairmont with mountains behind is worth seeing.",
          "Unassuming stop-off on the way to Banff which proved to be an excellent viewpoint over the town and surrounding area, with wonderful photo-ops of the Rockies. Well constructed and maintained platforms allow plenty of space - even on a busy day - for all-round views.",
          "That quintessential view of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. Great photo opportunity. Good views of Sulpher Mountain and the gondolas.",
          "We travel to Banff regularly. We always take in this view. There are so many wonderful vistas in Bannf but, with the hotel, in th ebackground this one is stunning.",
          "Walk from the pedestrian bridge in Banff along the river. It's a very easy trail, and extremely well maintained. Eventually, after about 15 minutes, you will come across Surprise corner where the Bow river takes a sharp turn after tumbling down rocky outcrops in a series of",
          "The corner is really very close to town. And there is a tiny parking lot for cars and one bus spot. There is a very nice viewing platform across the road.",
          "Create your own postcard or selfie at this iconic spot. Just a short walk from the parking lot and up the road from the Bow river walkway. No admission charged. Only minutes from downtown.",
          "Great spot to view the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel! You get the postcard view!! While in this area, continue to follow the road and do the Tunnel Mountain Drive! In another location along the road, there is a great overlook, in which you can observe river rafters, see elk,",
          "Very cool view of this awesome hotel, and yes it was a surprise, we were looking for a bike trail and happened along this view. There is parking and steps to a better angle for photographs.",
          "I was hoping to get a good shot of the Banff Springs Hotel with a forest backdrop. Surprise Corner is the perfect spot!",
          "Who can visit Banff without wanting to find that spot with the iconic view of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel? We weren't disappointed. We went here for both a night view and a daytime view. It was better than the pictures we've always seen.",
          "It was a great place to get a quick view of some of banff (especially the fairmont). But considering all the other great views in the area, this is not so remarkable. It was a great place to stop on our way out of Banff.",
          "This is a great easy enjoyable walk along the Tunnel Mountain Road. The surprise are the Hoodoos, if people are wondering why this name. The Hoodoos are natural rock formation and its a great way to engage your visual skills on what those Hoodoos look like. The view of Banff",
          "We walked to Surprise Corner and it was nice to see and get a photo but the smoke haze didn't add to the picture. Not anyone's fault but we enjoyed the walk there.",
          "There is no real surprise here, but you do get a great view of The Banff Springs Hotel for your holiday album.",
          "Had some nice views and it does create a good start to climb tunnel but other than that not sure why it was named that. C est la vie.",
          "I had been told that this was \"the best view in all of Banff.\" However, you don't really get to see Banff. You get a very nice view of the Banff Springs Hotel. It's a lovely hotel, but I don't think it merits a viewpoint all of its own.",
          "I always take our out of town visitors to this spot first when we go to Banff. Parking can be bit tricky but the view of Baffled Springs Hotel from this location is nothing less than spectacular. You can take your photo from the platform across from the parking spots but better",
          "This is someplace you can drop by and take a few photos but honestly there isn't much to see; don't be fooled by its name. You can get everything done there within seven minutes, as there are only a few steps to the viewing podium. I expected more due to its name so I was",
          "Reached by Tunnel Mountain Drive, this little turnoff gives you a great view of the Bow River and Falls plus the Fairmont Banff Hotel on the opposite side. There is a parking lot so you don't have to park on the side of the road which can be dangerous. Very, very pretty view but",
          "We decided the name comes from being surprised at the traffic that comes zipping around the corner while you're crossing the road! View of hotel is great for photos.",
          "By all means, drive up the Tunnel Mountain Road for some excellent views and great photo opportunities.",
          "This one location is easily the BEST location for anyone seeking a photo opportunity beyond compare! There is a safe parking lot where the road turns, but the lookout which is about 100m away is absolutely stunning; the railing is necessary for those wanting to observe the Bow",
          "Nice drive up the mountain to get a view of the Fairmont. While up there, we were encouraged to keep driving up the road to see the HooDoos. Beautiful views all along Tunnel Mountain Road.",
          "Great photo opportunity for pictures with family members to capture the experience of the stay at this historic property. Easy drive from the hotel and worth visiting.",
          "Not much parking but people don't stay too long so cars come & go frequently. Great views of the Bow falls & Banff Spring Hotel!",
          "Be careful trying to park here. This is, as one would expect, on a corner. The parking is very limited and there were plenty of people trying to park when we visited, some with caravans and campers. Lots of pedestrians walking around so be careful. The water falls are pretty but",
          "I have the photo taken from my I pad. This is stuck to my memories n words can not describe them. Wonderful location of the hotel.",
          "The Surprise Corner is not known to all tourists but is nevertheless a nice place to spend a few minutes. Here one can have a nice view of the Banff Springs Hotel. Munir Daya",
          "Worth a drive or walk. This one is one of the most beautiful views in Banff. Small parking there as well. We parked on the street.",
          "Along the hiking path you will come across the Surprise corner about 10 minutes for the average walker. You will be able to view the Fairmont Banff from above. Was not so much of a surprise and the view is fairly good but not breathtaking.",
          "After all the other drives, this is not my favorite, but surprise corner makes it worth it. It is the best view of the Fairmont hotel. It is only about a 20 minute drive.",
          "Having lived in Alberta for more than a decade and also having been to Banff countless times in my life, I have never been up to Surprise Corner and didn't even know it existed. We discovered it on our way to the Banff Centre. Wow, what a view and photo op! It is worth a",
          "I can't recommend the GyPSy guide to Banff enough - it really made our trip. We did the Banff Townsite drive and Surprise Corner was one of our stops - it's a great view and fun to see! Not worth spending a lot of time, but jump out for a photo or two, definitely. The rest of",
          "Whatever natural place I would have to review around Banff I would have to mark at least as \"beautiful\", if not as \"amazing\". This fits the bill too, and it is a nice little walk to get there.",
          "A quick stop for another elevated view of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel and town. Just be careful crossing the street to get to the viewing area. Only need 10 minutes for this stop. It's free. There are stairs to contend with to get to the viweing area. Very pretty.",
          "This is the perfect view point to see the Banff springs hotel. It is a walk up some wooden steps to a huge wooden platform where you can take in all the views and amazing photos of the Banff springs hotel. Just be careful crossing the road as sometimes it gets busy.",
          "Great spot well worth the stop. You are able to see the beautiful Fairmont Banff Hotel and Bow Falls from a distance. Make sure that when you cross the road you are careful it can be quite dangerous. There is a set of lights there for pedestrians please make sure you use",
          "Nice viewing platform for photos of the Banff Springs hotel. About 2 minutes from parking lot with only a few small flights of stairs. Wooden boardwalk or tarmac.",
          "You can cross the street (they have an electronic sensor to make it safe as the road is a corner and some drivers don't know how to drive!). Plenty of parking. Cross the street and climb a few wooden steps to the platform (huge platform/deck) for a view of the Banff Springs",
          "Whether or not you stay at the Banff Springs go here to take great postcard perfect pictures of the hotel.",
          "Nice place to stop to get a good view of the Banff Springs Hotel and surrounding scenery. There is room to park and it is a nice spot to stop for just a couple minutes to take in the view or longer if you want and have time to relax.",
          "If you're looking for a good spot to get a good view of the Fairmont hotel, then this is the spot. There's a car park with ample parking and the day we were there, the cars were being checked for the parks pass ticket.",
          "We were there on a rainy day and surprise corner was still a great place to take in beautiful views of Banff, including of course of the famous Banff springs hotel. There is a small car park off the road then a walk up some stairs to the lookout. If it wasn't raining we would",
          "This was a nice spot to eat a picnic dinner at the lookout, and take photos of the Fairmont over the river. Remember the mosquito repellent.",
          "You can get great views of the iconic hotel \"The Fairmont\" Banff Springs as well as the Valley. You don't need to spend too much time here.",
          "If you are looking for a photo vantage point to get some really great images of the Banff Springs Hotel this is the place. You'll find excellent views of the BSH at Surprise Corner. We found surprise corner was a real surprise for one motorist who had plowed in to a tree since",
          "We usually park down town in Banff and walk. Surprise corner is a nice easy hike (slight slope) from Banff town centre or easily accessible by car. There is ample parking at the location that provides beautiful views of the hotel and Sulfur Mountain.",
          "Great location to view the Fairmont Hotel and take photos. It's also the beginning of the Bow Valley/Hoodoo Trail. We decided to hike the distance all the way. If you don't want to hike the trail you can drive to the end and walkdown to the lookout to view the Hoodoo and Bow",
          "This is the place to be for the best view of the gorgeous Banff Springs Hotel. Although views of it from ground level and peeping through the trees as you approach the hotel are great, you really need to see it from above, and Surprise Corner offers wonderful photographic",
          "Nice views, but of course there are views everywhere here! Just follow the map from the information centre and you can find lots of interesting places.",
          "This is the best spot to get a view of the Fairmont Hotel. Not hard to get to from the centre of Banff and has parking and an observation area. Very hard to see Bow Falls from here. You also get a good view of the Banff Gondola from this place.",
          "Surprise Corner is one of the more interesting stops on Tunnel Mountain Drive, with a great view of Bow Falls and the Banff Spring Hotel. Note that there are several places to see the view, but the best one is slightly back down the road toward town from the parking lot.",
          "Surprise corner was a little underwhelming. It is a lovely view of the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, but with all the natural wonder surrounding you in this part of Canada, seeing this was uninspiring.",
          "Great 5 minute stop to get an incredible view of the most stunning building in the area the Fairmont. Actually better at this distance than up close. Also views of the Bow River and the surrounding mountains are spectacular. We would definitely stop there anytime!",
          "Well worth a visit if your in Banff the views are fantastic, Be sure to take your camera every which way you look is a postcard view",
          "Selfie anyone? Best view of the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel and the mountains surrounding and beyond!",
          "The iconic views of the Banff Springs Hotel can be seen from the viewpoint at Surprise Corner. Park in the little parking lot on the right and walk across the road to the viewing platform. Watch crossing the road, because Surprise Corner is on a........corner and cars do speed",
          "The view is great from here but I think the surprise is crossing the road. If you want to get a great view from a higher spot you have to watch for cars speeding around the curve in the road. Move quickly and safely!",
          "It doesn't matter how many times we visit Banff, we always take the 20 minute or so walk up to Surprise Corner (Boo! haha!!) There is a great view of the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel from here that is just breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Stopping-by as we had some snaps all over the place, views are great, center of eye attraction is the Banff Springs Hotel.",
          "Not sure why it is called surprise corner. Any body know? The views are nice though and as one can look over the Bow falls it is picturesque. Maybe on a clearer day?",
          "On this drive you can get a great shot of the Banff Springs Hotel (castle). There is a place to pull over and snap pics and the's also a little hiking trail across the road with benches. We've done the trail before but it is closed during the winter. It's also a place to spot",
          "The time I recommend going here is just before sunset when the light is dimming and the fairmont is glowing with its outside night lights illuminating the building. It looked like a hidden castle, nestled in the mountains. Something out of a movie - a lot of Banff looks like it",
          "This is THE spot for a picture of the Banff Springs hotel and only a very short drive out of town. Well worth the time!",
          "We were at a wedding and afterwards thought we would have a drive out. It was funny that we had just been to Banff Springs Hotel and here we were with a different view of it. The views and scenery is just amazing. I thought that Scotland had big mountains until I came here.",
          "It sounds like a cool name but really aint a heck of alot there. Why not have more amenities or change the name.. There were some nice views though.",
          "Nice way to see the impressive side of The Banff Springs Hotel. Not a lot of traffic. Only negative is the viewing platform is closed, maybe just for the winter?",
          "Well worth the drive. We could see it from our room, and the staff recommended the visit. We're glad we did, if only to get a great shot of the Banff Springs Hotel. But there was much more. the panorama was stunning.",
          "Surprise - there's the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel - so what. There's a small carpark area and then you have to walk back along the road for a view of the Bow River and the hotel.",
          "This is one of the best spots to take a photo of The Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. Absolutely magnificent. We stopped here in October and there was nobody around.",
          "This is a very good spot to set up for a photo of the hotel. You can also get the river in the foreground. Close to downtown Banff.",
          "The falls are nice and the view of the hotel is ok, but the hike to the hoo doos along the river is quite nice. No hard scrambles, some up and down, but the scenery and views are quite nice. the hoo doos are a bit of a let down, but the walk is nice. saw a huge Bull Elk",
          "The surprise is worth it. The view of The Fairmont Banff Springs is one that I admired online, and now that I experienced the view first hand, I appreciate it even more.",
          "A very short drive from Banff Town Center there is an outlook that offers a lovely view of the Bow Falls and the surrounding countryside split only by the imposing Fairmont Hotel. They have biult a lookout that gives an okay view of the falls but there are some pathways that",
          "Less than a mile up Buffalo Street from downtown Banff, offering a nice overlook of Bow Falls (with the Fairmont in the background), a forested trail down to its bank, which also continues on the uphill side probably back to downtown. No charge. Just good luck sometimes finding",
          "Surprise Corner is a wonderful place to have a picture of Banff Springs Hotel with Sulphur Mountain in the background. It's a really striking scenic view. That said, in an area as beautiful as Banff, where isn't?!",

          "Beautiful view of Banff Springs Hotel and surrounding area, done as part of Brewsters tour which was entertaining and educational",
          "You have to go here to get that photo everyone has, so give in, make the short drive up the hill, park with the others who take up most of the parking spots. It is worth it for the one perfect photo.",
          "One thing to point out is that if you are walking to Surprise Corner, the signposts at the car park suggest that you walk straight past the viewing platform. This will take you on a short rocky trail which is worth following for the view of the mountain and river, a good spot to",
          "A perfect place to stop and get a picture of The Banff Springs Hotel. There also appeared to be lovely walking trails down to Bow Falls.",
          "Not much to say other than I was a little underwhelmed by the view - I was expecting something a little different I suppose , interesting view but nothing special.",
          "It was a nice surprise. It is up top looking down at Bow Falls. A very pretty view of the water falls and the river. You have to drive the Tunnel Mountain Road to get to it.",
          "Surprise Corner is directly across the Bow River from the Bow river Falls viewpoint and gives a more dramatic view of the Falls and the canyon. Easy to get to from Banff Ave.",
          "Stop at the corner for a great viewpoint of the hotel BUT tunnel mountain trail is nearby. It's an 'easy' hike, they say but gently uphill the entire way. I found it taxing BUT the views on the top 5500 feet above sea level mt was breathtaking. You have vistas on both sides of",
          "This is only a quick stop really, although you can hike down to the river in front of the falls. To be honest the view from the Bow Falls carpark is as good and no need to hike. Anyway, Surprise Corner is worth a stop. Walk up the river on the road to the kerb stones and you",
          "Surprise corner is a must do! Stop and take a look at the majestic Banff Springs Hotel from the other side of the hotel! Stunning!",
          "From surprise corner there is a trail that you can do which takes you through some forest and then to a running lake with a sandy beach (small but lovely). It's not too hard going and on a sunny day is well worth the hike",
          "Great view of the Banff Springs Fairmont and the mountains. If you've already been on the Icefields Parkway tour, it's not as impressive."

This is probably a better view of the river, falls and hotel.  We were pleasantly surprised.",

          "It was great to get to visit this museum. There was a lot of information and it was super informative. It\u2019s important to learn about the history of the land and the native people. It was only $10pp so we felt it was great value for money.",
          "When I first came in 1983 this building was not there, only the First Nation trading place which had numerous Buffalo Nation trinkets. So when I saw there was a museum I was eager to visit. I had visited one in New York last year and was left a bit disappointed as there was",
          "We enjoyed this museum as a family. A portion of the museum was closed so it was 50% off admission - it kept us out of the cold and we got to see some beautiful displays, and was worth the discounted rate. The dioramas and displays of beadwork/quillwork/etc were wonderful",
          "I admit to being a Native American culture buff so was excited to visit this museum. I stepped back in time when I walked in - but not in a good way. There were no explanation boards about the history of people and this area. Only the typical Native American tribal wear - again",
          "Though not a large museum, the Buffalo Nations have created a wonderful exhibition of the First Nations culture. Well worth a visit",
          "Spent a bit of time here exploring the museum. Great artifacts and movies. New exhibit was under construction. Worth a visit",
          "A great visit to learn about Canada's First Nation people and its history. There needs to be more museums or information regarding the First Nation people throughout Canada.",
          "While in Banff, super important to round out your visit and go to this museum and appreciate the cultural and historical significance of the items in this museum. And its next to the beautiful Bow river... Pays reverence and deference to the first nation peoples and their",
          "A little quirky, but I learned a lot about the subject from the displays at this museum. I really likes seeing all the beaded regalia!",
          "After seeing the fort walls across the bow river when we were out for a walk we decided to go check out the museum. Once going into the giftshop and seeing the admission price of 10 each I was a little hesitant and thought it may not be worth that much. However, after going",
          "This museum is very respectfully done and very interesting. Like a small Cody Smithsonian. The outside suggests it's some play park and I wasn't go to go - boy was I wrong. There are some lovely exhibits and you learn tons. The shop is very different and worth a look.",
          "This museum highlights the local First Nation tribe and has lots of good displays and historical information. The museum is small so easy to get around. I would recommend going.",
          "I was disappointing as I felt it was badly kept for such a special collection of artefacts. It seemed nothing had been done in years to upgrade it. The models were very 'one face fits all' which is sad. The personnel in the shop appeared to have little knowledge or interest in",
          "The 15,000 ft\u00b2 log fort on the bank of the Bow River is home to the Buffalo Nations Museum. the displays are very informative, well presented and lit. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. For anyone with an interest in indigenous North American culture this is a must.",

          "We have been here before. It is very well done however for the price it is a little expensive. There is not really much to see. They changed it up and would have liked to see more do e once you get inside. I think this could be a great museum if there was more work put into it.",

          "The talent that's infused in this loving museum is amazing, and it merits the attention of any Banff visitor who cares about the journey of indigenous people. It's tucked away just before you head over the bridge above the Bow River and into the quirky larger town. You have",
          "Very interesting and a museum well worth visiting. The history came alive and a history so often forgotten. At times very moving. Its on the banks of the Bow River and there is a lovely riverside walk.",
          "We loved the way the artifacts are displayed-many in a tableau of scenes with very realistic figures. The textiles in particular were beautiful and varied. The 3 d goggles were fun, as was the fugure head over the door, which greeted you in english or differeng first nations",

          "We had an excellent visit here. The displays varied from dioramas, virtual reality goggles, video and clothing displays. This museum would be great for families but as a couple we both enjoyed. There is an amazing video of Canadian First Nation\u2019s visiting Australia.",
          "I'm gonna be honest: had it not been for the rain, we would have never come in here. But I'm so glad we did. The museum is small, but has a lot of interesting items and features, for kids also. The relaxed atmosphere and the interesting presentation of the topic really were an",

          "I enjoyed myself at this museum. The curators have clearly devoted themselves to creating visually engaging exhibits. But, quite frankly, there was not too much on offer here that promised to expand my sense of First Nations' experience on the Prairies. But I have lived in the",

          "As it was a blizzard on our last day we went round two museums in Banff. The Whyte museum and this and we got a discount for a joint ticket. The Whyte was informative but felt very worthy and dull but this one was much more enjoyable. I liked the reconstructions of various",

          "This was always one of our favourites, especially with the kids. A very unique collection of preserved nature of the alpine environment of the Rockies",
          "We arrived shortly after they opened at 11. The smell of fresh brewing coffee filled the gift shop. The curator was a kind woman who made sure we knew the layout of the museum and offered her fresh coffee and tea for an after tour treat. The museum itself is so interesting! Fun,",
          "Loved the curator. She was very informative and nice. The gift shop was nice and reasonably priced. Loved the taxedermy that was done to preserve the animals and wildlife. The scenarios were set up so nicely, as well. Beautiful art and craftsmanship",
          "A really nice museum just off the main road that is worth visiting. We found it informative with excellent exhibits and a few high tech interactive displays that were very interesting. Definitely a highlight of our Banff Visit.",
          "I found the few things on display passably interesting. The mannequins looked like they could come alive at any time (not just at night). But that's it.",
          "The legacy of First Nation people is a secret that deserves the attention of the world.Not only the stunning art and craftsmanship, but respect and harmony with the environment. The archived footage of First Nation visitors to New Zealand, Australia and Africa makes clear that",
          "Spent a very nice couple of hours on a rainy morning. Very interesting \u2013 especially as it was designed and run by First Nations. We enjoyed the displays and artifacts \u2013 tepees, wagons, tools etc. Very well done and well worth a visit.",
          "A self funding museum full of wonderful artefacts and information relating to the first nations tribes of the area. At only $10 adult admission, which includes complimentary tea or coffee, plus a warm welcome and well priced gift shop you cannot go wrong. We recommended it to",
          "Visited here on our last morning in Banff. Well worth a visit - well presented. So interesting to see full sized models in their native clothes and all their history. Well stocked with costumes, headdresses, photos etc.",
          "Absolutely loved this museum. The free coffee was a bonus. Loved the exhibitions. Staff were very helpful. Do see this",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed the authentic artifacts, displays and dioramas depicting the life and culture of the First Nation people who lived in this part of Canada. The museum is owned and operated by a Council of First Nation representatives and is a must see for anyone having an",
          "The museum provides a comprehensive display of the life and history of the First nations people in Southern Alberta in the 19th century, including examples of their language and a video of a bison stampede. However, apart from a very interesting display dedicated to RM Gourlay,",
          "We visited the Luxton Museum when we were staying in Banff and found out many facts and points of interest that we had not been aware of previously. The beading and quillwork was quite amazing and who knew that they originated in Europe and were traded to the First Nation",
          "Encouraged by our tour director to not miss this museum and were not disappointed. They offer senior discounts (US also). This is a self-guided tour with videos and dioramas of First Nations history and rituals. There are displays of daily life handcrafted items. Allow an",
          "There is a discount if you do Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies & Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum. Go to White First and they will have the combo pass. It saves a few dollars. We really enjoyed the Buffalo Nations Museum but we got lucky when we went as two elders were",
          "We enjoyed this very much, and found, as we did other places on our travels, how obvious it is that Canada is trying to make amends for the appalling way the first nations have been treated, by highlighting a culture that has been largely taken away. I grew up in the US, which",
          "Family of 5 spent maybe 20 minutes at the museum. The exhibits have decent quality exhibits but just not enough. The taxidermy animals are fine but lack any historical or educational value. Not worth what they charge.",
          "We had a full day when we saw this museum and decided to go in. Glad we did. Very nice introduction to the First Nation. It is a small museum, but has some very nice displays with clothing, models and sculptures. We have lived in the southwest USA for more than 20 years. We have",
          "It\u2019s quite upsetting to read about why and how all those buffaloes were slaughtered and what effect that had on the landscape of the area. We learnt some very interesting facts including how the First Nation got the feathers for their headdresses.",
          "The museum had a lovely display and a wide range of items to see. You could hear the different Indigenous languages being spoken. They had dioramas. They had life sized tipi's and realistic scenes of Indigenous life.",
          "We visited the Luxton Museum on a rainy day while visiting the town of Banff. The museum has many interesting displays and artifacts such as tools, weapons, and accessories that were used by the natives. There are many animals to see such as a mountain lion, bald eagle, grizzly",
          "We came here to kill some time whilst the rain cleared! Some of the info was interesting however it was a bit too much fake Indian sculptures and not enough history. Still a great exhibit and only $10 adult entry but I feel they could have all more history info",
          "The Luxton Museum is a small museum, but it is full of interesting artifacts, clothing, weapons, and tools used by the Native Americans who once lived alone in the area around Banff. There were several animals that were mounted and on display that can be seen in the area from a",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect here but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of information provided, the exhibits and wonderful historical clothing and photographs. I sat in the chair and watched the video about discovering native heritage and becoming an elder, which I",
          "This museum is very small. It consists of a few exhibits depicting First Nations life and clothing. There are two video displays that are informative. The seating to view the videos is on folding chairs and there were not enough for all visitors on the day we went. The admission",
          "This place has a lot of history about the Indians. It is not a huge place but they do have some good exhibits and artifacts. I am not sure if younger kids would enjoy it. It is kind of pricey for what you get. $10 dollars per person. Allow enough time to read the exhibits and",
          "We enjoyed our morning at this museum. It is small but has some interesting videos and the displays were very well done with a lot of history. Only complaint, no restroom and videos could have been a little louder.",
          "Although the exhibits were very interesting and a cup of coffee was included in the price, I didn't like this place because there were lots and lots of stuffed animals which made me uncomfortable.",
          "Excellent museum learnt so much so much to see and learn great shop near there too with great gifts Don miss either of them",

          "We were pleasantly surprise by this museum as it has some very interesting items and information. Well worth a visit - and you are given a free cup of coffee.",
          "Fancied knowing abit more about the history of the natives from the area,a very well presented and informative museum and not very expensive,a massive building and properly over the top but built from logs..worth a visit all said",
          "We didn't find many places that gave a history of the First Nations in Canada. But this museum certainly helped to change that. The entry fee was very cheap & free coffee/tea is provided on entry. The displays are fairly new & are all very well done. We spent over an hour",
          "There excellent exhibits depicting First Nation people. Beautiful bead work and great historical explanations .",
          "The base of all buffalo nations civilization and culture is preserved in this museum. From clothing, headgear, hunting equipment till the sundance ritual and its origin, it was facinating. They have a video gallery about the use and misuse of their land and identity which is an",
          "A good introducation to learning about the First Nations People. Not as great as Glenbow Museum but the videos were wonderful. Nonetheless, I encourage you to learn more about the history of he land and people.",

          "Buffalo nations has a small exhibit. However they didn't feel connected to each other, either by chronology, or seasonal transitions. The android app also had the exhibits in alphabetical order rather than the order on the floor.",

          "Wonderful displays of a past that Canada often tries to forget. Knowledgeable staff who explained many of the displays will revisit.",
          "Anything to do with native tribes in Canada or America and I am hooked. This is a great museum although when we went in early December maintenance work had temporarily closed some of it, still great though. Loved every minute we were there.",
          "The Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum is hidden out of view. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it. It resembles a smart fort. It is $10 to purchase an adult ticket. Coffee or tea are included with your ticket. It\u2019s not a very big museum - take a hour to appreciate it fully. Shortly after",
          "Spent a couple of hours looking around this very interesting museum. Some amazing paintings, photos and artefacts with good descriptions to aid understanding. Very sad that first nations people have been treated so badly over the centuries but hope this museum increases",
          "We arrived late but were thankful to be granted entry (at full price). We missed one room of exhibits as it was being loaded into a truck destined for the Smithsonian. We were offered free coffee prior to entry which was a pleasant surprise and there were other refreshments",
          "Passing this on the way back to the hotel from the Banff Gondola so decided to call in the finish off the day. The museum proved to be interesting and informative and would not hesitate to recommend. The staff were all very helpful and informative.",
          "Great museum with interesting displays, videos and explanations about the history of the original inhabitants , their way of life and how it has changed. Well worth a vist . Centrally located.",
          "I really like visiting the museums in Banff. The history is so rich, but I found this museum pretty pricey for the exhibits they showed. I think it could use a SEVERE make over and bring in some more exhibits that are more appealing.",
          "Very diverse set of exhibits of Buffalo Nations culture. Friendly staff and intricate, well constructed, displays. We attended a reception there during IEEE SMC conference, and the catering was also very good.",
          "This is a very informative and interesting museum. we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The story of the relationship between the bison and the first nation people is explained well. There are various dioramas depicting the rituals and day to day life of the early people. Lots of",
          "We have been coming to Banff for more than 30 years. This summer we brought our 10 and 11 year old grandchildren for a week in the mountains. One of the \"must see\" experiences is the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum. The kids absolutely loved it and spent a great deal of time",
          "It was late when we got to this museum which was not good as we could have spent longer than an hour at this place. I could not believe that no one else on the tour went and saw this attraction - their loss - our gain. Its in walking distance of the village of Banff and is on",
          "We decided to visit after seeing the old style fort which houses the museum on our way to Cave and Basin and we are so glad we did, the only other museum we have seen in the Canadian Rockies which comes close to this is Jasper Yellowhead Museum. Whilst some of the mannequins",
          "The Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum is on Birch Ave so although not in the main part of Banff, it's not too far away. It's definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone who has interest in native culture. Displays of animals, crafts, the handiwork of various native peoples, and mock-ups",
          "Lots of original artefacts laid out in a very informative way not stuffy at all, not a big place but very friendly staff and would definitely recommend a visit to find out more about this fascinating area of Canadian history.",
          "A museum dedicated to the First Nations way of life and history/. Educational and lots of artifact. Recommended.",
          "This museum was much more interesting than we thought it would be. The exhibits were very well done and it told a story of both the native Americans and the buffalo.",
          "When in Banff my boyfriend and I stopped here after seeing it along the way to another destination. We didn't visit the museum as there wasn't much time but we visited with the girl in the gift shop and bought some items from the shop. Lovely place and I would love to go back on",
          "A wonderful place to spend a wet morning in Banff. Really interesting and informative. There is a lovely gift shop and clean modern toilets. Staff are very warm and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. Very reasonable entrance fee. Children would love this.",
          "The museum showcases the indigenous inhabitants of canada, the history, livelihood, customs and traditions, and provides a good knowledge to the unknowing visitor.",
          "Highly recommend visiting this museum while in Banff. The displays and dioramas highlight the ingenuity and rich cultures of First Nations peoples and how they lived their lives in this rugged landscape. Many of the displays include magnificent beadwork from different tribes.",
          "This looks really small at first but there is loads to see, very interesting Free drinks are offered and there were deckchairs to relax in outside. The shop round the corner is a great place for picking up souvenirs too.",
          "My first thought about this place was that it\u2019s mixing metaphors more than a little to have an Indian (or First Nations) museum in what looks like an old western cowboy fort! Inside, it\u2019s a spacious facility that probably could have used its space a little more fully. But they",
          "This museum is FULL of Indian history and BEAUTIFUL bead work. Good for kids to learn about the early people.",
          "Very informative. One down side, the commentary from one presentation interferes with another nearby. A lot more interesting than I thought it would be. Found it strange to be offered free coffee at the start, but it was welcome. A good insight into the First Nation's culture.",
          "Conveniently located near the town centre in characterful property and with welcoming staff. Reasonably priced entrance fee. Good parking. Some interesting and informative exhibits.",
          "The senior rate was $9 which I thought was good value the exhibits were very good you learnt quite a lot about the first nations and how they survived,there was a git shop on site ,spent almost two hours looking round the museum.",
          "We stopped in here for a visit and although it is a small museum ( with attached shop) there are a collection of exhibits that were interesting and gave an insight into the First Nations way of life and a nice range of videos to watch as well that were very interesting. I would",
          "Run as a non-profit. Exhibits very balanced, coverage various aspects of first people culture. We also got a talk and dance performance, arranged by our guide/tour co. which added to experience. Good gift shop too. reach. for adults, families, children. Not crowded.",
          "Gives a good over view of the First Nation although the historical details may be a little biased towards the settlers and doesn't perhaps show the true disruption suffered by the indigenous people. Some of the models are truly weird - it's as if someone bought a stock of",
          "I was not at all for visiting this attraction, but I'm glad we did. Learned a lot about the First Nations People, their history and heritage directly from the tribal leader. After a short verbal presentation you are free to roam the museum and see what life was like. There",
          "This is an interesting museum which is worth a visit if time permits. Entrance fee is reasonable and it is not a big museum so does not take up too much time. But the exhibits will enhance one's knowledge of the First Nations ppl.",
          "It's still a work in progress, but you really need to drop by this addition to Banff. Very informative. The kids will enjoy it, too.",
          "As our second museum in Banff, I wanted to show my European friend something of the life of our founding people. The selection of beaded clothing, scenes of village life, and mounted animals was great. There were two different films playing which offered further information.",
          "On a rainy morning we visited the museum and found the experience charming and educational. It was not crowded but the exhibits were nicely arranged. Our \"guide\" was a delightful young woman who was \"adopted\" by the tribal peoples and who was learning their language. The exhibit",
          "This was a very interesting place to visit especially as it concentrated on the original inhabitants of the area. The staff were very helpful.",
          "A fascinating insight into the Buffalo Nations; something to do to while away a few hours. Good value entry fee, I even got my senior discount it being my 60th birthday :-)",
          "I really wanted to visit, this museum, but was a bit disappointed with some parts of it - the mannequins, displaying daily life, looked old and it felt like they were just filling up space. Don't get me wrong i did enjoy it, and enjoyed learning more about the first nations. I",

          "This was such a disappointment. I was really keen to learn something about First Nation heritage and history, and although there was some interesting things to look at, there was very little information, history context or dates. For example, none of the artifices were dated,",
          "During our holiday tour in British Columbia we could find little information about the history of the country before the Europeans came and colonized it. But the Buffale Nations Luxton Museum filled that gap with good and clear information.",

          "I loved our experience at the Luxton museum. Even though the museum is a bit dated, the information is still very interesting. Loved showing my family from Australia all the taxidermy animals! We were even treated to a private show of a First nations instrument (looks like a bow",

          "We had a lovely few hours here. Theres a lot to take in and a lot you can learn. The displays were well thought out and informative. I'd recommend if you had couple of hours free to go here.",

          "I loved this museum as I wanted to see a bit of the First Nation history. It didn't disappoint although the people at the front desk weren't overly welcoming which was a bit of a disappointment.",
          "I like the memorabilia from the first nations and was blown away by the signed treaty. We were o fortunate to meet a first nation gentleman who performed music for us and his bow made music! He made it sound like a digireoo, hoof beets, train, a helicopter, it made our visit",
          "Just over the bridge this museum was well woth a visit if you are interested in the Cnadian First Nation history. There are many tableaux and displays that help understanding of the country Europeans found a century or more ago",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this museum, it gives you an insight into the First Nations of Canada. I had a bit of difficulty finding this, there were no directional signs until you get to the end of Banff near the museum, this wasn't the case for the other museums. Do feel Banff",
          "We found this museum by chance whilst strolling by the river in Banff. It tells the culture of the first generation nation. The exhibits were interesting, informative and sometimes graphic. I found the craft work beautiful. Only let down was the heat it was stifling in the first",
          "Lots of well done scenes with easy to read information. Interesting artefacts. Also some taxidermy which was interesting to see all the different animals",
          "This was a really interesting museum. Really brought home to us how unfairly the First Nations were treated. A fascinating insight into how they really lived. An amazing people.",

          "The museum contains a huge mass of material in terms of photos, clothes, tools, craftwork used until very recently by the indigenous peoples of the area, and really teaches you a lot about their way of life. It would be nice if it told you more about the extent to which they",

          "We were not sure what to expect when we went to this museum - it is your basic roadside attraction - there is lots of artifacts to see but many of them seem to be very similar to each other. Signage was minimal which could be good or bad depending on how much you like to read",

          "Well done and good value. However I took my young son...there is one life size scene of a ceremony performed and the guy looks tortured with bones through his chest skin and roped to a turning device. My son kept asking about it and was horified. I had to tell him that the guy",
          "What a find this was. On visiting this region, not only did I want to see the beauty of the region and animals, but also see the cultural side of the first nations people. The outside gave the feeling of expectation of what was within - and was all I'd hoped for and more! First",

        "wiki": "The Fairmont Banff Springs, formerly and commonly known as the Banff Springs Hotel, is a historic hotel located in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The entire town including the hotel, is situated in Banff National Park, a national park managed by Parks Canada. The hotel overlooks a valley towards Mount Rundle, both of which are situated within the Rocky Mountain mountain range. The hotel is located at an altitude of 1,414 metres (4,639 ft).\nThe hotel opened in 1888 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, as one of the earliest of Canada's grand railway hotels. The hotel property has undergone several stages of growth and redevelopment. The original hotel structure was designed by Bruce Price, with another structure completed in 1914. In 1926, a fire destroyed the original structure on the hotel property, although a replacement structure was later completed in 1928. The building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988. The hotel property is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Banff Springs Hotel sits at 405 Spray Avenue near the southern boundary of Banff, a resort town within Banff National Park. The hotel property is bounded by roadways and natural waterways. Two roadways bound the hotel to the north, Bow River Avenue, and Rundle River Avenue, while Spray Avenue bounds the hotel from the west. To the east, the hotel property is bounded by the Spray River. The river serves as a tributary for the Bow River, a waterway north of the hotel property. The hotel property sits near the confluence of the two rivers.\nThe town of Banff is located within the Rocky Mountains mountain range, situated 1,414 metres (4,639 ft) above sea level. The community itself is built around Tunnel Mountain. The hotel property looks over across the valley towards Mount Rundle. Other mountain peaks located near the hotel include Cascade Mountain, Mount Norquay, Stoney Squaw Mountain, and Sulphur Mountain. Given its location within a national park, the hotel is located near a number of attractions and natural landmarks. North of the hotel on the Bow River lies Bow Falls. The Banff Upper Hot Springs is a commercially developed hot spring located south of the hotel.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nBanff Springs Hotel is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by Canadian Pacific Railway. The present hotel property is made up of two main buildings, an eleven-storey tower, and the main block of the hotel. Designed by Walter S. Painter, construction for the tower building, or the centre wing, began in 1911, and was completed in 1914. The main block of the hotel was erected from 1927 to 1928, and replaced the original wooden hotel destroyed in a fire. The original structure was a five-storey wooden building, able to accommodate 280 guests, was designed by Bruce Price. On 24 June 1988, the hotel buildings were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.\n\nAfter the original wooden structure burnt down in 1926, John W. Orrock, an engineer with Canadian Pacific Railway, was charged with designing its replacement. The replacement building, or the main block, consisted of the north, and south wing. As with the tower added in 1911, the replacement structure is made up of a steel frame, clad in Rundle limestone. Orrock based elements of the new building with the general styles of the original wooden building designed by Price, meaning that the main block also featured elements found on the chateaus of the Loire Valley in France. As a result, the main block features massive wall surfaces, and steep copper roofs, dormers, and gables.The original wooden structure, on which the present north and south wing designs are based, featured architectural elements drawn from Scottish baronial architecture, as well as the chateaus of the Loire Valley. This blend of architectural styles would eventually lead to the Ch\u00e2teauesque style used for most of the grand railway hotels in Canada. Ch\u00e2teauesque features found on the building include its steep pitched roofs, pointed dormers, and corner turrets. However, contrasting later Ch\u00e2teauesque hotels built in Canada, Banff Springs Hotel's also draws elements from the Arts and Crafts movement. Elements from this movement include rounded gables, and rough stone masonry used throughout the building. The remains of the burnt building were removed in 1926, in order to make way for the north and south wings.The centre wing tower was a large limestone structure, influenced largely by Scottish baronial architecture. The building was designed originally as an extension of the original wooden structure.  Unlike the other wings of the hotel, the centre tower featured almost no French medieval architectural elements. Painter's designs had windows that were rounded, flat dormers as opposed to pointed ones, and rounded arches rather than pointed arches seen in French Gothic architecture. The central wing also featured a Renaissance Revival styled arcade before its first floor lounge.\n\nThe interior of the hotel features oak beams, oak panellings and linenfolds, animal carvings, plasterwork of the ceilings, Terrazzo floors, and stained glasswork. Materials found in the interior include fossil-filled carved Tyndall limestone from Garson, Manitoba, and Bedford lime flagstones on the floors of Mount Stephen Hall, an event room within the hotel.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe Banff Springs Hotel includes 757 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel property. The hotel property also houses a number of event spaces, used for conferences, weddings, and other social events. Event spaces within the hotel building include the Alberta Dining Room, the Alhambra Dining Room, the Cascade Ballroom, Mount Stephen Hall, and the Riverview Walk. Given its location, the hotel property also features outdoor event spaces, including a terrace garden.\n\nA number of areas within the hotel property are also occupied by restaurants, or other food-based services. As of December 2017, twelve restaurants operate within the hotel property. Restaurants located within the hotel include 1888 Chop House, the Samurai Sushi Bar, the Waldhaus, and the Rundle Lounge. The latter restaurant also hosts the hotel's afternoon tea. The hotel also hosts a locally sourced market, Stock Food & Drinks. Other facilities located on the hotel property include a bowling alley, five turf-topped tennis courts, a swimming pool, and a 27-hole golf course designed by golf course architect Stanley Thompson. Spa facilities were opened at the hotel in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original building was shaped as an H and included an octagonal centre hall, with an additional wing extending from its towards the Bow River. The building was clad in shingles with stone accents. Tiered verandahs were situated at the end each wing. The 1888 structure cost $250,000 and a mistake made by the builder changed the intended orientation of the building, turning its back on the mountain vista. This building included more than 100 bedrooms, centered on a five-story, octagonal rotunda. An addition in 1902 expanded and renovated the building, adding more than 200 rooms.By 1906, plans were advanced for a complete overhaul of the Banff Springs Hotel building, proposing a replacement of much of the original structure. Walter Painter, chief architect for Canadian Pacific Railway, designed an eleven-story central tower in concrete and stone, flanked by two wings. This time correctly oriented to the dramatic view, the so-called \"Painter Tower\" was completed in 1914 at the cost of $2 million with 300 guest rooms and, for some time, became the tallest building in Canada. Construction of new wings was delayed by World War I, and the surviving Price wings continued in service.\nThe hotel was named for William Davidson, who had grown up in Moray, close to Banff, Scotland, and was the first European settler in that area of Canada. The name borne by the Canadian city and the national park is derived from his native country. Halfway up the internal staircase closest to the Bow Falls is found a painting of Davidson felling trees on the Miramichi River during colonial times.  The painting of the pioneer is by the war artist Cyrus Cuneo (1879\u20131916), who executed a series of paintings for the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nFurther renovations designed by architect, J. W. Orrock, who continued in style originated by Painter, significantly expanding the Painter Tower, altering its roofline, and adding his substantial additions. In 1926, while work was proceeding on the new wings, a fire destroyed the remainder of the original building designed by Price. The two new wings completed and opened in 1928.\n\nThe Monarch of Canada, King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth visited the hotel during their 1939 royal tour of Canada. From 1942 to 1945, the hotel was shut down in an effort to free up labour for the war effort.In 1968, the building underwent a process of winterization, allowing for the hotel to operate year-round. The hotel went through several renovations during the latter half of the 20th century, including one in 1971, and another in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics.In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels, the hotel division of Canadian Pacific Railway, was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel's name was changed to the Fairmont Banff Springs as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2006, seven Fairmont hotels, including Banff Springs sold to Oxford Properties, a company owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts continues to manage the resort following the sale of the hotel property.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Canadian railway hotels\nList of hotels in Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRobinson, Bart (2007).

          "The gardens are very picturesque and one of the few free things to do in town. There are several instagram worthy spots in the gardens. Plan on spending around 30 min to walk around and take it all in. Enjoy the nature, the mountains in the background and walk the trails before",
          "Free parking (early bird gets the worm here) and no admission fee to walk these beautiful gardens. Cascading stream runs through the property and from the front of the building a stunning view of main street Banff. Peaceful and well worth the time!",
          "The gardens are very beautiful, though I had to admire much of them from a distance as they were laid out at a time when accessibility was not really a priority. the staff seemed sorry about that, but there wasn't much they could do. In spite of that, we enjoyed our visit",
          "A must stop and see place. The grounds are kept beautiful. The flowers are amazing. Great picture spot. There is parking and some benches to sit at.",
          "This place is a must see for anyone who loves gardens, nature and flowers. Tremendous effort has gone into this beautiful layout and color coordination. Amazing variety of flowers, with beautiful steps and waterfalls with a number of gazebos or arbors. You can pretty much point",
          "These gardens are blooming in flowers in July and looked so pretty. A wander around the beautiful gardens and waterfalls is definately worth doing.",
          "Very beautiful. It was easy to access. You cross a beautiful bridge to get there. Great place for pictures!",
          "The gardens themselves are just gorgeous plus they are the perfect place from which to take that iconic Banff Ave photo!",
          "Due to heavy rain, we could only drive by the front of the gardens, but what we say was very beautiful and still worth it to go by in the rain.",
          "I make sure to visit each time that I visit Banff. The flowers and knotted woodwork are amazing. And there is an awesome view of Banff avenue.",
          "A lovely way to enjoy a fragrant and lovely spot in Banff. And plenty of free parking. The stone steps are not great for visitors with walking difficulties.",
          "After a multi-year restoration project, the water features in Banff's Cascades of Time Gardens have recently returned to life after being dry and empty for years. The Cascades of Time Gardens and the nearby Banff Administration Building were both designed by Ottawa architect",
          "If you travel to Banff, I encourage you to spend some time exploring and taking in the beauty of the Cascade Gardens located in downtown Banff. You will enjoy the natural beauty of the budding trees and multitude of gorgeous flowers. The pathways will lead you up a slight hill",
          "They have a big gate around it, but the smaller door-like gates are used for entrance. The big gate is intended to keep out the elk. I was there the third week of June, which was a bit early. Most plants had just been put in the ground. It is a very beautiful setting with many",

          "Beautiful garden, albeit small. Amazing landscaping. We thought there was some sort of museum there, but it is the Banff Parks administration building. Nice place to spend 30 minutes walking around and taking pictures of the beautiful flowers and landscaping.",

          "Well located to give a good view across the river to Banff town and the mountains. This is not a huge garden, but the path & arches lead you up and around to enjoy the different colours, planting and water features. Pretty even in very early summer (1st week of June) and very",
          "If you are up this way, pull in and walk to the town side for the nice views of Banff Avenue and Cascade Mountain looming in the distance. We were there while they were planting the flowers so can only imagine how nice it would be once they are all in bloom.",
          "This is not a spectacular setting, but it is well done and maintained. The plentiful benches allow you relax mentally and physically. They just need to get some signs up, because of the construction, or you will wind up walking across the bridge like we did.",
          "Possibly we visited just a bit early in the floral growing season as only some flowers were in bloom. Quite an attractive, simple paved walkway to navigate the various features. Odd that did not see a notice about the origins of the main building.",
          "A lot of work seems to have been done since our last visit. The gardens are a now a beautiful haven away from the crowds on Banff Avenue. The gardens are beautifully laid out with gazebos, waterfalls etc, and masses of colourful flowers.",
          "I visited the gardens at lunchtime on a sunny day and they were gorgeous. They aren't very big so they may struggle to cope with crowds, however they are kept in perfect conditions, lawns and flowerbeds beautifully maintained, plenty of benches to sit on, shade in case you don't",
          "The garden is laid out in a charmingly off-center Victorian style. Rocks, waterfalls and gazebos made from gnarly tree trunks. But only a few of the beds are planted and maintained. Lots of untended grass, weeds and dirt. It looks like they are working on it and if it is ever",
          "Only a short walk from the town centre so there's no reason not to visit here even if it's to take one photo of the gardens, with Banff and the mountains in the backdrop. The gardens themselves are well worked into the landscape and beautiful in their own right.",
          "Absolutely beautiful gardens with amazing view of the mountains; these gardens were full of color and greenery with little resting areas to take a minute and admire the lawns; flowers; butterflies; water features whilst taking in the surrounding views. Very tranquil and just a",

          "On a rainy day, we we did an all-day walk of the townsite, and we saw approximately half of the buildings listed in the Walking Through Banff\u2019s History leaflet (self-guided tour). Part of our walking tour was through Cascade Gardens.",
          "Such well kept gardens and with stunning backdrops of the Rockies. It's free to enter and to roam around the gardens at your leisure. Well worth a visit.",
          "Just over the river from the town centre, it seemed an easy place to stroll to before we walked along the river to Bow Falls. Unfortunately, they were renovating the most interesting part of the gardens when we visited, so the cascade was not cascading though we got the general",
          "These are very picturesque gardens with waterfalls, ponds and beautiful flowers. There are many pathways, so you can walk around and across the pools and cascades. It is a great place to relax and enjoy the sound of the water and the colourful display of plants. Be prepared to",

          "Still a little bit of a construction underway, but a lovely maintain garden right in the heart of Banff. Great for a picnic on a sunny day.",
          "This is absolutely a must-do when you're in Banff. It's off the beaten path and seems to be missed by many tourists, so it was nice and quiet, with this exception of the construction taking place in the gardens during our visit. We did wait for the free guided walking tour",
          "The gardens were beautiful to stroll through on a quick trip through Banff. A nice stop on an otherwise hectic and long trip. Great views of the city from the steps of the historic parks administrative building.",
          "We visited the gardens surrounding the Parks Admin building early one morning and were very pleasantly surprised at how beautiful they were. The staff were quietly working to keep the flowers looking their best at the end of the summer season. Well worth a visit. - free !",
          "Just off Banff Avenue and behind the Park ain building are the Cascade Flower gardens, still beautiful in late September",
          "In the summer, it\u2019s colourful walkabout for 30-60 minutes to see the flowers and views. It has the best view of Banff Ave you\u2019ll find for selfies or candid photos. Best time for Banff Ave photos from the front of the gardens is late afternoon or early evening when the sun",

          "This is the best place to take a picture of Banff town. It's a little garden with easy parking and beautiful flowers and the way it's made, i'd see pictures of a wedding getting place without a problem. Nice little wood houses to have different views. Great for a little walk.",

          "These Japanese style gardens are wonderful to explore or just chill and read a book in. With varieties of flowers and bushes, along with babbling brooks and water fountains, this is a gret place to take pictures. The area was under construction in parts of it but did not take",

          "The Banff city is now adding new gardens to the original garden. Even with all construction (summer 2017) was possible to stroll around and see the beauty of this place. The garden has different types of flowers, gazebos, places to sit and admire the flowers and plants. I bet",
          "Enjoyed a leisurely stroll amidst the gardens around 6pm. Stunning views of various elevations of rock gardens with flower borders, water pools and benches amidst the breath taking views of downtown Banff! Rows and rows of color abound and it is so peaceful! A great place to",
          "No charge to walk through these lovely cascading gardens. They were expanding when we visited which did not detract from the floral beauty. They let us walk our leashed dog in the gardens also. Very nice. Leisurely. A must for any garden or flower lover.",
          "Just a short walk from the shops, beautiful gardens and water features, gazebos, lot's of places to sit, and clean washrooms. Given the quality of the gardens and amenities, and proximity to the main shopping area, this is well worth a visit. Great place to picnic.",
          "The gardens were completely closed when we visited (late June 2017), but it seems like it's now partially open. Hopefully by next summer they'll reopen because I am visiting Banff again for my birthday in June. From looking outside of the garden gates it was beautiful already,",

          "We had some of our best pics in the Rockies taken here!! (And considering this is a manmade feature haha). There are numerous superb positions for profile pics, and the gorgeous backdrops made most of our pics look as if we are standing in front of a full flatscreen TV. Simply",
          "A lovely place for a walk. It's going to be absolutely gorgeous once the construction is finished. I find it a bit surprising that they would do construction this year, knowing that Canada 150 would bring more tourists. Would have made most seme to finish it last year or wait",
          "We were disappointed that so little of the gardens were open as it is under development. The website certainly showed more than was open to walk around. Having said that, it is very pretty and well looked after with great views over Banff and the mountain range.",
          "The gardens were undergoing lots of work during our visit. The flowers were very nice and the gardens will be very special in the future.",

          "The gardens are undergoing a complete renovation. One of the fountain areas is complete with another four under construction. Great views of the area. Nice garden area. Free parking",
          "In June, these gardens were completely under renovation. Probably won't be back to their full beauty this summer, but I'm sure they will eventually recover beautifully.",
          "Don't miss a chnace to walk around tthese small but beautiful gardens which are still under development. Lovely designs but the best feature is the fantastic view they afford looking back across the bridge into downtown Banff, and the mountain backdrop. Well worth half an hour.",

          "I was very excited to go visit Cascade Gardens when my family went to Banff, for I found pictures online and it looked stunning. However, it turns out it is under some sort of renovation. It doesn't look that pretty, and nobody is allowed in. We were very disappointed that we",

          "We stopped by after exploding the Cave and Basin historic site. Nothing to see there, garden is under construction and there is little place to walk to take picture. Only bright spot is OUTSIDE the garden, behind administration where you can take a picture of the Banff town with",
          "Cascade gardens is a beautiful garden at the end of Banff Avenue. The landscaping is well done and it's fun to walk around and watch the pollinators at play. Lots of bees and butterflies buzzing around. Great views of the mountains and makes for some great picture taking scenes.",

          "Walked around this park, plenty of flowers still in bloom, nice winding pathways and various places to stand and sit taking in the views. Shame the water feature wasn't working.",

          "Unfortunately when we visited it was closed due to reconstruction. When we visited 16 years ago it was a good place to visit and wonder through.",
          "We were looking forward to seeing these gardens but when we visited large parts of them were closed for refurbishment. Consequently we were unable to fully appreciate them and had to be content with viewing those parts which were not a building site, from the roadside.",

          "Only the main building can be visited. A number of entrances are closed and the place is a bit like a building site when I was here. I don't know when it will be finished but if you are visiting in September 2016 then you may be out of luck to visit this place and see the",

          "Just an another garden. Nothing special. Some hotels in town have better flower displays... Maybe slightly better views.",
          "Most of the garden structures are created from rock including the paths and I saw a bridge that was made out of knobbly wood which looked good. The gardens are nice but not so big - but saw a wedding party take photos here. The building stands out when you cross Bow river",
          "Although the gardens are beautiful, they were not upkept and there were a lot of weeds and overgrowth particularly on the higher level gardens. There was not water in the many fountains. Not sure why Banff is not maintaining this beautiful area. Great photo opportunities and",

          "The gardens are planted in patterns. I think the growing season is extremely short so not certain how the flowers got to the stage they were in. Weed free with very beautiful gazebos and places to view and contemplate",
          "I think it was a little early in the season. All the water features were off and the plants were quite messy. Still a good walk though. gazebos and bridges enough to satisfy. A great picnicking lawn in the front. Little oasis to enjoy some sunshine.",

          "The town of Banff has some sensational displays of flowers in the commercial area, so I expected the Cascade Garden to be a showplace. Some aspects were noteworthy--the knobby pine bridges and gazebo structure, but several areas of the gardens had no plants or flowers making it",

          "Being from the southern United States, I am always interested in flower gardens in cooler climates. The flowers here were beautiful and the landscaping was great. This was a quiet place, away from the bustle of downtown Banff. It is a work in progress and is a plus for Banff.",
          "The gardens were nice and wind up a series of pathways. It was a nice little walk, but all of the pools/fountains were dry. You could see that if they had been working, it would be something truly spectacular, given the intricate stonework. That part was a bit of a shame, but we",

          "The gardens were very colourful with plenty of flowers blooming as we went in late summer. The only problem was that some of the gardens were out of bounds as they were maintaining them. The was a lot of machinery about as they were lifting heavy rocks by the water features and",
          "Very beautiful even when the gardens aren't planted. But unfortunately the bathrooms aren't open for the season, even on May 14th. People were all looking for open bathrooms but we all had to go across the river to use one! Not fun when you are pregnant and have a toddler in tow!",
          "This garden was a make work project during the depression and a quiet and cute spot for a wander or just sit and take it all in. Last year I did not see the small river/water feature filled so hope that they finished the work and it will be filled this year. Like the bat boxes",
          "You will be amazed when visiting in the summer, with color array of flowers and the extensive green grounds. Watch when there are outdoor concerts - its magic!",
          "The gsrdens are a little treasure and a place to get some quiet since Banff has become the business town it is. Great peaceful walk through the flowers.",
          "we happened to be in Banff in Mid October, The Cave Basin was closed and so we decided to go to the Cascade Garden instead. The workers had already taken the flowers out, and were working on the pools and creek beds and putting on a top coat of dirt for next year. We took some",

          "This is a beautiful garden that does cascade down the hills. It is a miracle that it has survived over the years. The ponds are dry due to leaks and need a benefactor to step up and offer a \"challenge grant\" to repair them. Water would add so much to the garden complex and move",

        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

          "We loved looking at this 1903 original building and all of the amazing animals inside. It's great for all ages. But little kids MUST keep their hand to themselves all of the glass and such are original to the building but so worth it!!! Also take a picture of your discovery pass",
          "Located in a historic building, there are lots of interesting facts about the park. There are lots of mounted animals and birds to help identify the critters we saw while exploring. Was not expensive and didn't take long to tour. i recommend taking 30 minutes to educate",
          "A worthwhile visit combining the National Park history with featured animals in their natural setting display cases. This venue is well over 100 years old dating back to the late 1800's. Ample parking is available and the museum is close to the bridge. Entrance fee is CDN$ 3.90",
          "This was on our sons stop as he loves history. It has a lot of curated animals from the Banff area. They also do the explorers program for children. Great way to learn and make it fun. Bring the book back to the front and say the pros pledge and get a small gift. Depending",
          "I thought this was a very good museum of the animals, rocks, fish, and birds of the area. The toddler in our group enjoyed seeing the animals up close. Amazingly interesting history of the collection and the zoo that used to be there.",
          "Not a usual Museum as it is almost all a display of stuffed animals & birds, as that is what the original 'curator was a biology expert who loved exploring the area. The displays are great and were good to help us identify some of the anmals and birds we had seen but hadn't",
          "It's only small so I nearly didn't bother stopping, but it was only $3.90 entry so I thought 'why not?' So glad I did. It's not a modern museum by any stretch of the imagination, but they tell you that when you walk in, plus it's pretty obvious! It's a fascinating place to",
          "This is truly a museum with a real sense of the role of the biology expert who really studied their animals. The building is small but very impressive and gives on insight into how nature was and should be studied. It is well worth the $3.00 CAD entrance fee.",
          "This is a small, but great museum at one end of Banff. It houses a lot of animals and is a great place to visit with kids. If you do, get an XPLORER book for them to work through. My son did it, and it made the museum a lot more fun, and exciting. They even get a prize for",
          "My kids love the Parks Canada Park Xplorers program. The staff at the Banff Park Museum went above and beyond with the ceremony, and it was so fun! Really unique collection, and such interesting history! My kids loved it so much they begged to do it again.",
          "Cheap entry fee, little museum. Filled with beautiful animals. If looking to kill half hour, stop by!",
          "My family and I spent an hour here as it was free with our annual park pass. It\u2019s an interesting collection of animals, mostly from the 1900s. Good place to wander around for an hour.",
          "This museum is very beautiful from de outside, but once you're inside you will discover a magnificent jewel, the collection of animals from the region goes beyond expectation, everything is well preserved, and the experience is unforgettable",
          "Beautiful building, lots of history to be learned in this area, loved the animals, great hands on things for kids",
          "Este es un museo de amimales silvestres del parque pero disecados, es como un museo de la muerte, hay animales muy bellos!! pero me costo mucho conectar con eso. No es para todos!! This is a museum of wild animals in the park but dissected animals , it's like a museum of death,",
          "Surprisingly, we all really really loved this museum. We learned all about local bison, looked at all the incredible specimens from another time, and then had a hunt for the turkey vulture mentioned in the exhibit describing the Banff Zoo. Also, it was snowing and the views of",
          "spent some hours here the kids loved the animal collection and as well as being informative for adults kept the kids entertained with some intersting exhibits",
          "surprised upon entering. I didn't know the museum was about all of the wildlife in the area and taxidermy was amazing. Small museum but informative when you make the time to read about the species of the area. The curators were very informative and friendly.",
          "This natural history museum, in a historic building in downtown Banff, is best known for its large collection of wildlife residents of the area, now stuffed and mounted. These old specimens, gathered back when there was an abundance of wildlife in the park environs, offer a",
          "Unless you are a local with a great knowledge of the fauna of the Banff area the display of taxidermically preserved specimens should help identify animals glimpsed or fully seen. The collection is historic, so acceptable. Thank goodness the building, dating from the early",
          "One of the oldest buildings in Banff (1903) the Banff Park Museum is only around $4 entry and was a good way to view at all the animals native to the area. If your not into stuffed animals I would give it a miss as the smell can be a bit overwhelming. The building itself is",
          "A well organised museum, very informative with a good selection of animals and birds. Good information about the reintroduction of Bison to the area.",

          "Thoroughly enjoyed this gem located in the Banff Park, next to the Main Street bridge and the river. First and oldest museum in Canada, filled with a treasure trove of natural history exhibits. Canada Parks staff are helpful and highly knowledgeable...be sure to interact with",
          "This place is a gem! You can earn a junior ranger badge here too. It was a rainy day so this was a bit crowded. But, it is filled with so many exhibits and a really neat building. They have a room off to the back that kids can play in and they have a library for reading",
          "We enjoyed our visit very much. It was like spending time in my university zoology lab with the all the taxidermy specimens of species in the park. Lovely old building. Parking lot nearby...but parking can be an issue. Lovely park and river is adjacent. We visited here then",
          "Small but nice museum giving a good overview of the local fauna. A bit old fashioned in style but as entry is covered when you have the park pass, it was without regret.",
          "We took our grandchildren to this delightful museum and they asked to return the next day. The hands on area was a hit, but the board game was what they enjoyed most of all. The museum could raise additional money if they sold this.",
          "This small museum is quite educational. The exhibits are mostly taxidermied animals. Staff was friendly.",
          "My son loved the activity book the guide gave him and the gift he received for completing it. If you don't like taxidermy, don't bother lol - otherwise it's a really interesting record of the animals that are native to Banff. The guide was superb - she knew so much about",
          "Although not very big, we spent over two hour in this museum, looking at all the specimens exposed here and we still didn't notice everything. Everywhere you look are mammals, birds or even insect that were collected carefully since the founding of Banff. Even the place itself",
          "A small museum with plenty of impressive stuffed wildlife. We and 8-year-old grandson really enjoyed this place. Staff very pleasant and provided an activity booklet for grandson. A very nice, interesting , quiet respite from the heat that day, and the busy tourism that can be",
          "We found the array of animals the best part about this museum. Not being from Canada or the States, it was a great way to see a lot of the native animals in one go. Staff were friendly and it was easy to get around.",
          "This museum looked small but was very good with very well informed and enthusiastic staff on duty on 26th June.",
          "Lovely building but didn't really enjoy the exhibits. Staff were helpful and it wasn't expensive. Wouldn't revisit",
          "Interesting building and displays from years ago. I can't remember exactly, but I believe some of the specimens are from the early 1900's. Amazing how well some look. And also the detailed work that goes into documenting all the arly research that was done.",
          "Banff National Parks Museum, full of history, see all the Canadian wildlife under one roof all stuffed, wit a history of the growth of Banff and how things were from when the railroad came here, Very Interesting.",

          "Have a look, as will give you an idea of the area overall, worth looking through, photos are great also of what went on years ago. All Free entry-have a look. Was on a tour and had time to look.",
          "I popped in here since it was raining and to get an idea about the animals that live in the Rockies. Cost was $3.00 There was an array of stuffed animals that gave you examples of all the different types of animals. So it was possible to get close up to the animals and",
          "We loved the old building and tje old school taxidermy. Only takes about 20 minutes to enjoy it. Free of you have an annual parks pass.",
          "Calling this a museum is a bit of a stretch, it's more a collection of stuffed animals and various other objects (e.g. rocks) linked to the Banff National Park. The building is impressive nonetheless, all made in very well preserved wood and in the old style you expect from",
          "I was glad this only cost $3 to get it. It was ok, filled with 100 year old stuffed animals. It was interesting to see them close up, but some were showing their age.",
          "We had thought this museum explained the history re the Banff National Park - probably our fault for not doing research. However, it is basically a museum showing the wildlife via stuffed animals. Not our thing but could be yours?",
          "All the taxidermy brought back wonderful memories of my first museum visit. Very enlightening - beavers are larger than I thought.",
          "This museum warns you that it contains stuffed animals, so there is no excuse for entering if that isn\u2019t what you want to see. It is a fantastic building which has a clear history of its origins and provides contemporary exhibits from the collections of its founders. If, like",
          "Right on the main street in Banff, don't miss this historical and jam-packed museum. Up close and personal with all the critters that inhabited the area up to 100 yrs ago - the nominal entrance fee is worth all the beautiful exhibits. Kids will love it!",
          "We visited after being told it was open all year round. It is but only on a weekend. We were disappointed but they are obviously struggling to import enough Aussies to help run the place.",
          "Brilliant museum! Every kind of animal and bird and all labelled and informative. Absolutely loved the panelled walls. Lady on reception was very helpful and explained about the old lighting and the glass covering the displays. Great!",
          "It is very fascination history and the museum is easy to walk to from most accommodation and price is very reasonable and cafe's are close as well and near the river so you can have a nice walk to it along one of the best natural rivers we have seen and the river colour is",
          "There isn't much to see here, but if you're interested in animals then definitely check this out! It has lots of birds and other species native to Banff and the surrounding area. I wish they would put up some descriptions of the different types of species so visitors would be",
          "A completely different museum from any we had visited so far in Canada. It was free because of the 150 years but it is only about $5 anyway. Cabinets full of stuffed animals, also on top of the cabinets too. Both large and small. Some were older than 150 years so they were",
          "We popped in here for a little after visiting in the farmers market in Central Park. Lots of cool specimens!",
          "We popped in to warm up during our walk in Banff and were pleasantly surprised to find a great collection of local specimens of animals and history. The building is beautifully restored and there's a lot of history about its original curators and contributors.",
          "From the outside, it looks much bigger than it is inside, but there is a lot of interesting information and plenty of taxidermied animals. It's worth a look around.",
          "It is well worth a visit, particularly in winter to escape the cold! It is small, but interesting and may be the only chance to see some of the wildlife from the area.",
          "This is not a zoo, but a museum of taxidermy animals, many of which are almost impossible to see easily in the wild. The museum is free and would only take about an hour to peruse. There is a small library in which you can do research of local fauna and flora. Very friendly",
          "Nice way to spend an hour Plenty of examples of wildlife exhibits Friendly and knowledgeable staff My Only complaint is that the information signage for the exhibits is far too small to see, especially for those exhibits high above you on the wall",
          "We have always wanted to stop in at the Banff Park Museum & on this visit we were glad we did. Open 10am - 6 pm from May 15 to Oct 15, in 2017 it was free to celebrate Canada's 150th birthday. There is an abundance of wildlife from the Rocky Mountains, including stuffed bears",
          "This is a good place to visit if you have an interest in the animal life in the area. There are also quite a few rock and fossil specimens.",
          "i think this is where the springs are that started the whole adventure in Banff. It was the first time our tour guide took anyone there and we told her to keep it on the list!",
          "This is a fascinating FREE museum about the wildlife and the history of Banff. Staff are VERY friendly and helpful. However, the lighting is kept dim to a point where it is difficult to read exhibit details - why?",
          "On completion of our hour long visit to the small museum, we appreciated the efforts in preserving and documenting a part of natural history in Banff and surrounding areas. The museum displays the taxidermied animals and birds that live and used to live in this area. The first",
          "The museum is very small and takes max 20 minutes if you look at every animal closely. It's very interesting though. Good that it is free this year. I wouldn't recommend it if you had to pay for it.",
          "This museum offers lots of stuffed animals exhibits and is very informative re the natural and unique setting of these majestic mtns. Staff are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. If you are not familiar with the wildlife of this area and have interest in it then you must take a",
          "This free museum is well stocked with various stuffed wildlife from around the Rockies and it\u2019s worth visiting, though don\u2019t allow more than an hour as it probably won\u2019t take that long. It might however be the closest you will get to either a Moose or a Black Bear while visiting",
          "We got there for free because of Canada 150 so it was indeed a must. The lady in the entrance was hilarious and very accommodating. I just love how she deals with every customer. She had a joke to crack tailored fit for every guest, at least during the time we visited (Sep 18",
          "The Banff park museum is located in a lovely little Museum building in Banff. Formerly the railroad superintendents house, it has been lovingly restored to its original glory and the detailing in the building is amazing! It's a natural history museum filled with stuffed Canadian",
          "Nice collection of perserved local wild animals. Beautiful wood building. Nice way to spend a half an hour.",
          "Well, what a surprise, it's was a fascinating afternoon and spent 2 hours in here, as a wonderful collection of taxidermy animals from bears, wolves, birds, just stunning as hard to see wild life in Canada. Don't miss this experience.",
          "Very informative and interesting. Wheelchair accessible. Knowledgeable staff. Interior spacious and well organized. Well worth the visit.",
          "I've found the collection very interesting. You will find all the animals of the park; so, even if unfortunately you have not meet some of them on the way, you'll see how they really are in this museum :) I think that the creator of the collection was an amazing worker doing",
          "This museum is a real step back in time. An historical building, housing a significant collection of stuffed animals and birds from the region. Free during 2017.",
          "We didn't know what to expect but seeing every animal from buffalo to grizzly bears to birds and fish really gave you a thorough knowledge of what you might see live in the park.",
          "Very well done museum which was free this year. Nice displays & interesting building. Glad we stopped.",
          "This museum is free for 2017 and the usual admission is only $3.90. Wonderful display of many animals you might see in Banff. Since we didn't see much in the way of live animals, this was fabulous! Great place to take kids for an up close view of animals. I would have liked a",
          "This museum is just amazing ! it doesn't look very impressive from outside, but inside the collection is stunning. Most of the specimens are more than 100 years old, the stuffed birds ans animals look like alive. My teenage daughter was so happy to see them, and it is very",
          "The reception was warm and pleasant to provide you all informations about Banff with a smile. We learned in depth about the history of Banff",
          "Yes, it's free but only this year. It is a quaint museum and some will make more sense if you have already been up Sulphur mountain, if not it will do when you have done! You need to look up as well as what's in front of you - the place is packed full of information and",
          "The museum prides a huge collection of local mammals and other living things, fossils, and a good collection of books and magazines from the past. Very educational.",
          "This museum is close to the river, park and washrooms. It's fairly small, the displays are pretty cool and the staff are very helpful. If you're into taxidermy you will absolutely love this place.",
          "Beautifully crafted log cabin with exquisite carpentry. All kinds of animals on display. From wolves to bears to birds. Quite a collection. Close proximity to other nearby attractions as well!",
          "You can't beat free to visit this wonderful two floor park museum which is a testament to the painstaking work collecting and presenting all the species of the region from the smallest bird to the largest bison and everything in between. Authentic era building and glass cases",
          "This free museum is in a small wooden building on the edge of the Banff River in the downtown area. It\u2019s very much an old-school museum that recalls the park\u2019s past glory and wildlife. We stayed here for less than half an hour, which is unusual for us, since we tend to read",
          "This small museum is free and easy to visit. Worth a look just for its beautiful wood interior construction-- but the taxidermy collection of virtually all Canadian animals from the region is fascinating, if a bit sad- though specimens date back to the early 1900's. You can",
          "Went here 30 minutes before closing, the attendant allowed us in and gave us a great introduction of the place. The museum has a wide collection of taxidermy of wildlife that lives in the region from birds, waterfowl, to bears and cougars they have it! The building as well is a",
          "Some would say that collections of preserved animals and birds belong to a by gone age but this collection and exhibition of the fauna and flora of the Rockies is invaluable in showing us what we will never now see in the wild. Our young granddaughter was enthralled throughout.",
          "Located right on Banff Ave, really easy to park and get to. The guides are fantastic and very knowledgable, many historic rocky mountain pieces and a good insight in to how tough the exploration must have been.",
          "Excellent to orient one to the area but a great attraction on its own. I first visited on my own but later came with the family as I didn't want them to miss this attraction.",
          "One man's meat etc. Sorry it didn't do it for me. Just case after case of stuffed animals. I appreciate that some might find it fascinating, but I expected more variety in the exhibits.",
          "Good to see the wildlife of the surrounding area in a well presented museum. Interesting to read about the animals habitat and history. Good for children and staff very helpful.",
          "Parking lot was crazy to get into and find a place to park, super busy as there is a park located there too. They had explorer books for the kids to enhance their visit, where if they completed 5 activities, they received a badge, zipper pull and temporary tattoo. My children",
          "We stopped in at the Banff Park Museum, mostly out of curiosity. The antique glass cabinets are really neat to see. There is a lot to look at and take in. If you're needing a bit of a break and want to take in a museum this would be well worth your time.",
          "Very interesting collection of animals - ranging from owls, hawks, eagles to bears, elk and deer. Very educational for school aged children who have never seen these animals in the wild. I was also amazed by the bird egg collection (sizes). Well worth the quick stop while in",
          "Interesting information on history of area, but basically cases of stuffed animals and birds. Lovely old building.",
          "This is situated at the far end of town near the bridge it will tell you the history of the area but if the weather is nice I am not sure a museum is the best place to visit you can find out so much on line in advance these days. Though everyone inside is very knowledgeable.",
          "This museum is basically a huge collection of taxidermy wildlife of the area. Its pretty cool, they are big mammals, birds, etc.. all in a very special building! Nice stop!",
          "Sadly, with man's obsession with ruining the environment and catching/hunting/trapping many species of animals, a place like the Banff Park Museum may be one of the only places left to see the species that have been taken from us. The animal/bird displays are well done - great",
          "Amazing place! If you ever wanted to see a museum from 100 years ago this is the place. All the animal mounts are from the 1890s housed in antique oak display cases behind old wavy glass. The inside is all original untouched wood. Definitely worth a stop!",

          "This museum is free to everyone. Lots of history of the area, many stuffed animals and wildlife. Both upstairs and downstairs viewings. Located very centrally in town. The rustic timber building was built in 1903 and looks as new. The museum was built for natural lighting",
          "Visit this museum only if you want to see all the stuffed animals cos you didn't managed to see the real live ones. It is just an average museum so only visit if you have nothing else on your to do list.",
          "This museum is more of a relic than a modern museum. That said, it's quite nice as a historic monument, freezing a moment in time from the early 20th century.",
          "This is a good place to stop and learn the names of all the wild creatures you have seen in the park and on your drive there. There isn't much here other than animal exhibits, but they are very well presented. It takes about an hour to see the whole thing.",
          "It is not often nowadays the this form of museum exists. It is actually quaint and reminds me of my childhood. The display helps identification better than pictures but is static and silent. The building they are housed in is a wonderful mix of Canada and China so at least try",
          "Beautiful 1903 wood building housing first museum in western Canada . Many mant taxidermy animals from chipmunks to buffalo. Some have stories . Really captures the old Banff in a gorgeous building. In park before bridge . 15-30 minutes depending on your interest in each",
          "This museum is limited to stuffed animals of the area and therefore not a great variety of interest.",
          "Very friendly and informative Ranger at the reception on the day we went. The building is history itself, and the exhibits, mainly wildlife taxidermy, ok stuffed beasts....are very well displayed",
          "It's located just right in Banff town. The building is old and historical. Lots of stuffed birds animals are exhibited here. Worth a visit to get an insight of all those local birds and animals that we didn't manage to see.",

          "have tried to visit this attraction a few times over the years, but as yet have never succeeded! on three occasions visiting Banff in the last 10 years, this place has been closed for one reason or another. I know they need to renovate and paint and clear up after the summer",
          "This small but very informative museum was very nice. They have so much taxidermy of all kinds of animals from local to different locations. The museum shows a lot of history of different animals as well as of the town of Banff and of the museum itself. If you like history and",
          "I cycle past the Banff Park museum every day and only went in last weekend. The building itself is beautiful and the inside doesn't disappoint either. We got in free because we have a 12 month park pass so that was a plus. It's not big inside but it's great to see all the birds",

          "The building itself is a treasure. Old style display of artifacts and animals. Two floors, a nice quick visit. Very reasonable admission.",
          "I love this as its original and you get information on history and development. Great products to buy and easy to walk too.",
          "All the museums are close together and all are worth a visit. We did them all. If you don't like stuffed animals and birds don't go here!",
          "We were lucky enough to drop by on the museum's last afternoon of operation in 2016. I had been several times before but my partner hadn't. The Park Museum is an absolute must-see in Banff: a museum seemingly preserved in amber from the first decades of the twentieth century. A",
          "This beautifully created original architecture building houses the oldest surprise in town! The young gentleman who was manning the desk the morning of Wednesday Sept. 22nd (if I recall correctly) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He was very informative and a wonderful",
          "Once again very helpful staff, an eclectic mix of exhibits and a beautiful library, lovely wooden house originally a home for the Park superintendent.",
          "I got great tour and loved the Museum. Everything is organized by categories. Almost all animals are over 100 years old. You could feel the same as people visiting this particular place in 20, 30 of last century. I absolutely loved furniture and personal items left behind.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the examples of wildlife in the area and some of the historical information. Lovely, quiet location. Well preserved.",
          "I found this quite fascinating - not only the awesome displays but the historic building as well. The woodwork in the building is gorgeous! And I had no idea our mountains are host to that many animals. A must see. And would be great for kids too.",
          "Last time we were at the museum they featured the great migrations of animals from Yellowstone up through Banff and often into the arctic circle. They also featured the animal over and underpasses on Highway 1. It was fabulous. This year they had art that we did not think a",
          "It was what it was an original style natural history museum with stuffed animals of the Rockies. friendly staff and informative labels on exhibits. About 4 dollars each to go in so value for money. Ok for 30-40 min visit.",
          "It collects at least over a thousand animals in this Museum. If you walk on Banff Ave and also have annual pass you should go to this museum and you will be surprised by its collections.",
          "A good place to visit on a wet day for about an hour. construction of the building was intriguing. Lots of stuffed animals and birds, interesting but really not that exciting.",
          "This museum is priced right - adults are only $3.70. There is a rich history in the building and it is our fav place to go when it gets a bit too rainy to be outside. My three year old could spend an hour looking at all of the animals and playing in the \"touch\" room where",
          "Very dated museum full of stuffed animals, with a very musty small. First floor accessible by stairs only",
          "Very educational and a great place to start your visit. the staff were pleasant and well informed. Great for the family.",
          "This museum looked great from the outside, so we wanted to have a look at what was inside. It cost $4 to enter, the lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful. The museum was built in 1903. It is an exhibit of taxidermy mounted specimens of animals.",
          "Stopped to see what this was all about. A great historical account of the animals which frequent and have frequented the area. Great exhibition on the wildlife and how life was back in the first days of the National Parks Well worth the visit. Use your Parks card for free",
          "Building is unique. Stuffed animals need attention, but it is a large collection that can help you identify what animals you have seen. Take your park pass to get in the museum free.",
          "A reasonable place to visit when it is raining. Nothing spectacular with some reasonable displays. Kids will find the place interesting.",
          "This a museum that is a museum of a museum. The museum from the early 1900's also includes the offie of the original curator as part of the museum. If you are new to the fauna of the area this is an easy way to learn to make visual identifications. Cost was 3.90 for an adult.",
          "Good exhibits and a nice way to learn about the national parks of Canada. In addition, the movie about the discovery of the springs in fun",
          "Visited this interesting museum (free if you have an annual National park Discovery pass). Great assortment of preserved animals from the park.",
          "This is a museum in a time warp but quaint and interesting so long as you dont mind seeing lots and lots of stuffed animals and birds. Charts a good history of the wildlife and on a cold or wet day, its an informative way to spent an hour.",
          "Our finial museum visit of the four, interesting information about the wildlife. Staff excellent, managed to identify some wildlife that we had photographed. Recommended.",
          "This is the place to go if you want to see preserved wild animals close up. It has exhibits on 2 levels with the larger animals behind glass. Small but worthwhile.",
          "Stuffed animals from the area,burds of pray were my favorite.no fee with your annual parks pass.l was than one hour to see it all",
          "Thousands of wildlife samples. all looks alive! amazing! cool inside, takes about 30mins to 1 hours. no food or drinks inside. I love this place so much!",
          "A historic museum that is filled with stuffed animals, birds, eggs and insects. Very interesting to see the old building and woodwork. Also interested to see the size of the animals.",
          "Good stop on a rainy day. A number of animal exhibits, with the note that today these animals would not be acquired the same way (i.e. killed in order to be on display). The staff was helpful, and the exhibits were informative. We spent about 45 minutes - that was about all",
          "This place is awesome. A museum built a hundred years ago with many specimens of rocky mountain animal and bird life, mounted in amazing taxidermy. The museum itself is worth a look. TIme well spent. A few bucks for entry.",
          "Well worth a visit and good value. Stuffed animals may not be very PC today but these were collected at the beginning of the last century. Well presented and very interesting.",
          "We stopped in to this museum on a whim and were pleasantly surprised. We were given a brief history of the building and then allowed to look around on our own. It was small, but packed with all kinds of taxidermy. It was interesting to see all of the animals that were",
          "Cute little museum. First museum of natural art in Canada. Has most of the most representative Canadian animals. Super cheap if you are on a budget",
          "I was overwhelmed by how close one gets to the large glass showcases of native animals and birds, as well as rock specimens. You can really see how powerful and beautiful some of the local animals are. The museum building itself is a treasure. This is a small museum that is",
          "What can you do when it's raining cats and dogs in Banff? Take a two hour dive into the past and visit the cats, beaver, bear, elk, and birds on display at the beautiful 1903 era Banff Park Museum, WOW! What a beautifully designed building and collection. Unlike the sterile",
          "If you are in the city of Banff, this is a must. It should only take 15-30 minutes, but it's worth it, especially if you have kids. The museum is basically a display of 100s of stuffed animals, birds, and insects of the region on display. Plus it's free with your parks",
          "What a jewel of a place! If you like history and learning about the people of the area, this museum is a great choice!",
          "A really amazing place. Quite a small place but so much to see. Staff are friendly and helpful and admission is cheap compared to many things in Banff. Very interesting and well worth s visit.",
          "This is a terrific place to visit at any time. The place is completely authentic with original artefacts and pictures. It makes you appreciate how much work was done by the original curators.",
          "I was actually looking forward to venturing here to see the history of the park but I walked in and saw a first floor filled with stuffed animals. The second floor had some random displays about the history of the park, one in particular said \"Long term solution\" on it but I",
          "Was very surprised out the selection of animals displayed and especially with all the labeling. Even though some were original it made it that much more interesting to see. The history displayed was great and they place is in tip top shape. Best $3.50 spent on the trip!!",
          "We'd already visited the Buffalo Nations museum, so I was reluctant to go to this one, but my kids were pushing for it and it was so cheap, so we did it even though it was just a half hour before closing. Two floors, very small, but packed with taxidermy animals and insects from",
          "This is a good stop to soak in some of the history of the area. Good displays and excellent staff make this museum a must stop when in Banff.",
          "In case you don't see any animals on the road, this is a great alternative. There are probably specimens of every type of bird and animal in the park. The staff are very knowledgable and happy to explain what you are seeing.",
          "This was a nice shorter thing to do. Loved all the different animals. The building is amazing. Great for all ages. If you have little ones CONTROL THEM. the glass and the animals are all very old and fragile this is not a free for all area. There is a designated touch and feel",
          "Outstanding boutique like museum. Nice artifacts and historical pictures of the history of Banff and an outstanding collection of animal displays from the area. We went with our two kids (9 and 12) and stayed for about an hour. They enjoyed it as there were things to touch",
          "Natural history museum, filled with great displays and the craftsmanship of the taxidermy and the building is just something you don't see these day..... So cheap at around $4 per adult. Well done Parks Canada!",
          "Worth a visit. Small admission fee payable. Interesting building, lovely woodwork. Helpful staff. Natural history themed exhibits plus historic information too.",
          "We go every time we visit Banff, kids love it! So much to see and take in. Very educational. And the building itself is a historical treasure,",
          "This is a quaint museum in the heart of Banff that offers fantastic and interesting historical information on the animals that live in Canada and the local areas. The building is fantastic and is apparently older than Canada. Definitely one for those that love architecture!",
          "we spend a hour+/- there...It was nice and having bought the park yearly pass it was free access..a must see if you have time to spare....",
          "Lots of local history about Banff and the early settlers. Plenty of stuffed birds and animals that were quite impressive. Staff very informative, helpful and polite. Good rainy day activity.",
          "When we entered we were met with friendly staff who described the museum as Victorian era layout and preservation. They told us it's not so much about the individual displays but preserving the way Victorians curated their museums. If your looking to see exciting and unique",
          "Kids of all ages will enjoy this (if you are in the mood for history). Excellent setting right by the Bow River.",
          "Selection of taxidermy animals to showcase what is in the park - no animals hunted for museum all where killed or died naturally and given for education purposes.",
          "this was our favorite of the museums in banff. a really cool building and some great historical info that tells how the park came to be and why it exisits.",
          "This centrally located museum is a gem. A beautiful and elegant building with an impressive collection of all kind of taxidermied animals. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. No matter what else you are doing in Banff, do not miss this museum. Children and adults will love",
          "An excellent example of the natural history, flora and fauna of the area. Also a brilliant example of the art of the taxidermist. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited the museum for 1-2 hours when it was rather wet and enjoyed it. It has a lot of \"stuffed\" animals that may not be to everyones taste but gives you an idea of how big some of the local animas are and allows you to learn a great deal.",
          "While with a tour group we were given a warm welcome followed by a good tour. We were addressed by representatives of the local traditional owners who told us about some traditional activities and actively involved about 60 people. A good place to visit..",
          "lots of animals to view. gives you a very god idea about the diverse wildlife in banff national park.",
          "The building is impressive from the outside, resembling a gigantic fort made of logs. Inside...Outside...not so impressive anymore. Mannequin scenes were too fake and stereotypical. Staff was very nice and helpful! There's free and good coffee there. Next door, the Indian",
          "the building is very old and interesting. there are many stuffed animals on display. the museum is well worth a visit.",
          "Great experience to see all of the mounts and different animals. Wonderful history! Highly recommend!",
          "Self guided tour. The receptionist was helpful. A great exhibit of animals from the area. The exhibits and building are well preserved.",
          "Well worth a visit to look at animals you might not see or will never see again. The history of this place is also worth investigating",
          "Do not miss this outstanding building and it just gets better when you venture inside and take in the workmanship that went into the building. Then the exhibits are a fine example of taxidermy of the day with egg collections of the bird life of the area perhaps not the modern",
          "The Banff Park Museum is an interesting place. It's a museum of the beginning of the National Parks in Banff, but it is itself part of that history. The building itself is an architectural gem, build entirely of wood and designed to let natural light in. The bulk of the",
          "Great museum of the museum, very friendly and helpful staff, nice exhibits, good to visit when in Banff.",
          "Interesting and informative - whilst I was initially suprised by the cost $18pp to see a single level museum / gallery the cost was soon forgotten as I moved around the various exhibits and learnt about the early history of the area. Part of the museum was closed for 'upkeep'",
          "Excellent, worth a visit. Good exhibits lots of animals. Great for kids Helpful staff who pass on their knowledge in an enthusiastic way",
          "This Museum is full of history and artifacts. You step back into early Canadian life and wildlife. Excellent Museum self guided low cost and very interesting. The walk around the river on the outside is wonderful.",
          "One of my favourite little places to see along with the gift shop with many Native themed gifts. Easy to get to and it's also along the river where you can stop and sit on some benches too.",
          "Historic taxidermy collection in historic building. Very knowledgeable Parks staff member - she was as interesting as the collection. Worth the $3 entry just for her stories; thought building was beautiful.",
          "Looking for something to do and want to gain a sense of what Banff is all about you should take some time to visit this museum. Cost $3 to get in. Lots of trophy heads stuff animals and the collection of one of the outdoors pioneers. Depending on how much detail you want to get",
          "The museum appeared quite busy so we just wandered around the park and along the river. There is a very large gazebo in the park and we spent some time looking at it's architecture. Because it was rainy there were not that many people around. There is a nice walkway",
          "This is a tiny museum on the river. The principal attraction appears to be stuffed animals - kind of a bush league version of the Safari Club International museum in Tucson. If looking at stuffed dead animals isn't your thing, then skip it.",
          "The Banff Park Museum is a sort of miniature version of the ZSL Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire (UK) - a temple to Victorian era taxidermy. We visited on a wet afternoon whilst in Banff and found this museum to be fascinating, well laid out and actually had a very cosy and",
          "This museum is a little tired around the edges, as the admissions person told us, but the history it contains makes it worth an hour or so to learn interesting things about the area. The taxidermy is really interesting, and the historic building is worth inspection too.",
          "Really interesting little museum. Cheap entry fee. Quite old fashioned with taxidermy examples of Alberta wildlife but this adds to the attraction. Pleasant half hour!",
          "A real nice Museum but needs some updating of displays. I would still recommend seeing it. Nice atmosphere.",
          "This is a great little museum that really lets you see how Banff Park was developed and how the early pioneers did things. It is very interesting.",
          "Small and quick museum to check out with your children, they won't get bored and make sure you do not go on a Monday. They close Mondays as I recall.",

          "On first glance I thought we would only be a few mins here. However, we were given kids discovery/explorer packs. These were excellent and my two kids got quite involved and actually learnt something from the visit. The historical information/photos on both Banff and the curator",
          "The historic building is beautiful, the docents are kind and helpful, but the displays themselves are dusty and tired. The docent said the displays are intentionally \"out of date\" to display how information was collected and studied \"back in the day\". For the purpose of",
          "The architecture of this building is quite impressive, but with no A/C on a hot day, the interior was stuffy and rather dark. The exhibits consist mainly of stuffed birds and larger animals with signs that are sometimes difficult to read. It is a fairly extensive collection of",
          "I wouldn't go out of my way to go but it was an okay little diversion. If you have an annual parks pass you get in free.",
          "This historic museum consisted of collections of stuffed animals and birds. The displays were very interesting and well displayed. Most were in glass cases. The museum building itself had been faithfully restored to its original design and was over 100 years old.",
          "There are many exponates there and they present that area pretty well. It was usefull to visit that museum.",
          "Not to be confused with the other large Museum in the shape of a fort. This was a private visit not a group tour. I was appalled and disgusted that the hitherto sensitive to nature and wildlife Canadians should display such historic atrocities perpetrated upon animals by the",
          "A must visit to see all the animals in the area some very nice work by Parks Canada the museum is definetly a must visit .Really thing if you visit Banff stop by you will like what you see.",
          "We were in Banff at the end of April and the museum wasn't open. There were a lot of visitors in town that kept coming to see if the place was open. I think they would do well to open a little earlier... perhaps mid-April. Peeked in the windows and it looked very interesting.",
          "If you have a spare hour in Banff, you should visit this location. It is only a few minutes walk from the busy Banf Ave. You can spend an hour on all the animals that you can find in the park and it is an educational and informative time spent.",
          "We decided to pop in for a quick nose around but there is soooo much to see. For anyone who likes animals and/ or history you will not be disappointed. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly too",
          "All the exhibits were in place a loooooong time ago, and are still looking great. This is a museum from the early 1900s with lots of stuffed animals and birds. well worth the $4 entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful building, lovingly restored. Antique exhibits are bowing their age, but are still very interesting. The whole point is to show how museums used to look, with their focus on displaying animals more or less as trophies. The building alone is worth the visit. It is",
          "The Architecture Is The Winner in the Banff Park Museum. Being the oldest in Banff I was expecting something in the architecture and it delivered. A must to see.",
          "This museum is one of the oldest in Canada, built before electricity. The architecture is such that it allows as much natural light into the building as possible. The animals on display are very old and have faded, but is so interesting the curation of the museum a century",
          "Brilliant museum which dates from 1903 see specimens of different animals ,insects and birds and learn more about the history of this beautiful area.",
          "The first thing you notice is the rustic architecture. Douglas fir predominates, and gives the museum a warm environment--one that \"feels\" rustic and rural. It was all built over a hundred years ago, and because artificial lighting was limited then, the designers put atrium",
          "authentic throw back place with a nod to science and history... great 45 minutes experience if you have the time... well worth it.",
          "Very interesting museum which details the flora and fauna to be found in the park with an extensive collection of stuffed animals which once roamed in the area. There is a small fee for entry which is well worth it.",
          "We did not go but the Kids went with the Kids Club at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, they loved it, especially all the stuffed animals, there was a Moose there are they could not get over how big it was, might be the only Moose you see on your trip so might be worth a look.",
          "the journey to Banff from Calgary is as beautiful as the Banff itself. breath taking view of Rockies, Bow river etc all add to the beauty of travel. must see place for anyone visiting Calgary.",
          "This place gives a person a very good amount of knowledge of the animals in this area. The wild animals that are stuffed gives a person a connection that would otherwise be missing if there were only pictures. early morning is best time to visit as you miss the crowds in summer.",
          "This is certainly different from your average modern museum, but for some people this could add to its appeal. The main interest is the large variety of stuffed animals on display, most of which are or were local to the Banff area. It is probably not something that could be",
          "Everything you would expect in a museum dedicated to Banff and the beginning of this resort town. If going, take the time to read the displays and walk the surrounding areas. Parking difficult in the summer. Park on the other side of the river, turn right after the bridge.",
          "Returned this summer with more grandchildren to give them the experience of the Banff Park Museum...of Natural History. There are over 5000 specimens on display, the old fashioned way. The woodwork just gleams with richness. The 1903 structure of BC Fir is indeed a \"National",
          "Great art and historical displays. We spent an afternoon here due to inclement weather and leaned a lot we would otherwise have overlooked. The gift shop has great local art. Amazing interactive displays.",
          "This small museum contains a collection of stuffed birds and animals of Banff Park. There are also exhibits of bird's nests with eggs, fossil and minerals of the area. There is a small fee and you can see everything is less than an hour.",
          "I always love visiting this museum. No I don't like the idea of stuffed animals but this museum is quaint and charming and most of the animals died as a result of accidents. A visit doesn't take long but it is fascinating.",
          "After being slightly disappointed in not seeing wildlife in Banff other than one pika and a mostly hidden caribou, it was interesting to see this museum boasting a large collection of the many animals that roam its countryside. The cougar and bears were particularly impressive",
          "Sold as a museum of a museum, the museum has been maintained with its original character since it was built and curated back in the 1800's. My favourite part was the original curator's office, complete with field books and records. Fun and engaging activities provided for the",
          "This is a timber building over a hundred years old, and is full of specimens from the old days, when animals were hunted, mounted and displayed. While we really don`t do that today, it is interesting to see the wide variety of animals there, and especially to note the way they",
          "One of Westerns Canada's oldest Museums and the oldest surviving building in a Canadian National Park, the building itself was the highlight for me. There are loons and grebes, songbirds, magpies, eggs, wolves, moose etc stuffed and well displayed. The museum is well lit by",
          "We didn\u2019t read all the plaques outside before going in so we were a little disappointed to find that the museum was an old-style natural history museum. In other words it is full of stuffed dead animals. Call me weird but I prefer my animals alive and in their natural setting.",
          "For what it is, this museum is a great way to see \"wildlife.\" Two floors of taxidermy animals. Great way for those who aren't from around here to see some of the locals. There's a back room where touching items is allowed, so that proved to be the best part of the visit for",
          "Its is a museum you have to see once when in the area. Two stories of local animals, fowl, fish easily viewed. Some weapon artifacts etc.",
          "The building is impressive, and the collections even more impressive. The stuffed animals from all over Canada give you a unique look at what these creatures look like up close. Very informative and educational. Well worth the $3.50 entrance fee",
          "This is a cheap location to visit, it is small and took us about 20 minutes to walk around whilst it was raining. May be better for kids or those interested in stuffed animals. It wasn't really my kind of thing to be honest but documents the history of wildlife in Canada",
          "Lucky for us it was raining, otherwise we would have missed this very good museum! It is filled with natural history! Great place to learn the ways to identify types of birds and animals and lots of interesting tidbits!!!",
          "This museum documents the wildlife found in this area. It was built over 100 years ago and is remarkably well preserved. The animals displayed are all stuffed, so keep that in mind. It is a small museum, one hour or so is plenty to see it all. It is close to the center of Banff,",
          "This isn't a large museum, by any means, but it was very interesting and offered a peaceful reprieve from busy downtown Banff. The building was built in 1903 and the (renovated) wood panelling inside is quite beautiful. Inside is a collection of carefully curated specimens of",
          "You you planing to go Sat, weekends or holiday expect delays and big queue of cars to enter the park. However, the phenomenal rocky view are amazing and different from the rocky of Colorado, in color and landscaping. Way more trees: Cedars, Spruces, Firs....the majestic Douglas",
          "We began our day here and what a great experience it was......wonderful to see all the wildlife from the last 100 years....Western Canada's oldest museum. There is an entry fee but for us well worth it....brilliantly presented and very helpful staff to answer",
          "One of the best small museums I have visited for a long time. Housed in a lovely building at the end of Banff avenue, it illustrates the wide variety of wildlife in the Rockies based on a collection of stuffed birds and animals collected in the early part of the 20th century -",
          "Mum and Dad (35) two girls (8 and 5). We stopped in here after visiting the farmer's market (Wed). The building is beautiful. A warm and informative welcome then led us around the plethora of stuffed animals, birds, insects and butterflies. Fascinating insight into the origins",
          "Great slice of Banff history and a neat view of how they told these stories 100 years ago through stuffed animals. A real throw back and a good deal at $3. The design of the building and all of the wood interiors were stunning.",
          "This is a good stop. 3 bucks a head and see a wide variety of animals from the area. Good history of this park, knowledgeable staff.",
          "Very typical animal and bird exhibits in an original wooden building adjacent to the road bridge at the end of Banff high street. Full of late 19th century exhibits and atmosphere.",
          "Can't remember the price but it was very reasonable. A small exhibit. It is life sized examples of the animals, birds and some insects mostly from the Banff area. There are a few examples of the fauna that is not indigenous but not many. It gives an excellent example of the true",
          "We went into the natural mineral spring cave that is housed in a large modern building. I did not care for it as the spring inside was smelled of rotten eggs. However, In another area there was a large panoramic film you could watch regarding the history of the area. This was",
          "This museum gives one a good idea of the variety of animals that inhabit the area. As intended, the building and displays are also interesting samples of what such museums were like at the early part of the century. We went partly to see the grizzly pelt which is on the second",

          "Banff town is, I would say, a fairly unmemorable few blocks of hotels, gift shops (some of which, to be fair, are very good) and restaurants. This stands alone at one end of the town and is a real little treat. The stuffed animals in this over 100 year old wood built museum",

          "Not your typical museum, the Banff Park Museum is more like a 'museum of a museum'. This resonates from the hand-rolled glass windows, charismatic wood construction, and the obvious perception of people in the 1900's towards animals in their taxidermy. Although only a small",

          "This museum offers its visitors a great display of the many forms of wildlife that live in the Banff National park. There are two floors of taxidermed animals, rocks, and history of the park and its wildlife. The attendant at the desk is very knowledgable and answered many of",

          "If being up close and personal with taxidermied (I may have made up that word) animals is your thing, then this is the place to be. The building this vintage exhibit is housed in is something to see on its own, as it is very beautiful. I got a real sense and feel of the history",

          "We had been told about this museum by the guides at the Banff visitor center. We passed it on our first walk around town, but saved it for our last day since it was raining. We were amazed with the extent of the wildlife displayed and the history of the Banff area. Well worth",

          "We went to Banff for a day trip last summer, and it started raining super-hard in the afternoon. We happened to be right beside this museum, so we stopped in to tour around and it was a great experience. It was kind of awe-inspiring to see how old some of the stuffed animals",
          "After a long walk and exploring the Banff Center. I entered this Museum. My companions we're already tired so they just sat on the bench provided infront. I viewed a lot of stuffed animals here quite a site , owl, mountship with beautiful horn, eagles, buffalo heads all",
          "It's hard to rate this museum because on one level it is just a dusty collection of 100-yr-old stuffed animals, but on another level it is central to our understanding of the wildlife of the Canadian Rockies and to the development of Banff. The grandchildren who were with us",

          "A nice selection of local (and other) animals are carefully stuffed and labeled. It is a good way to see the various sizes of animals you would otherwise not want or be able to observe up close. This attraction is free with the Parks Canada Discovery Pass; there is a slight",
          "A gem of a museum, set up in the same way as it was in the early 1900s when visitors first flocked to the area. Staff are exceptionally welcoming and it's terrific value. There are more thrilling places to go in Banff, but I would still put it on the \"Must Visit\" list.",

          "This is a 2-stotry museum. Discounted tickets with the Whyte Museum. Local animals are arranged by species. The ranger will explain the history and provide perspective to understand museum historical importance. Discovery room was very interesting even for adults. Who get to",
          "The Banff Park Museum's building is very nice, it is really authentic in the area. The exhibition is interesting, but not so big. We had a Discovery Pass which was valid here, without that (if there is no guided tour) maybe it is not worth to go inside.",
          "I did the tour at 3 pm and found it very interesting as the guide has a nice friendly manner and just chats with people in the group for the first few minutes so she gets a feel for what your interests are and where you come from - that part was interesting in itself as we had",

          "This is one of those places you shouldn't miss if you like history and nature. It's a great place to take the kids and teach them about the things they might see on their next nature hike/walk through the park!",

        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

          "The ride up the gondola was great and included a giant rainbow. Centre at the top had good info and the kids liked exploring it. The walk to the top of the summit was an easy one that didn\u2019t require any real skill. Walking on boardwalk with steps. Much more touristy than",

          "This is a must-do at least once on a visit to Banff! I've visited in spring, fall and summer. Any season is fine but you get the best views up at Sulphur Mountain on a clear day. There's an information centre inside before you check the outdoors on top. The restaurant/cafe also",
          "This was my second time on the Banff gondola and me and my boyfriend had a great time! The staff members were very nice, and they even went out of their way to ask if we wanted a picture together (Maddie Mac). The staff members, especially Maddie Mac and Raelyn (I am sorry, I do",
          "It was a nice ride up to the summit and the view of the Rockies from the observation deck was awesome. The main drawback is the cost, 69 dollars for non residents and 47 for residents why can't you offer it at no more then 50 for visitors and half for Alberta residents?",
          "We made a reservation at the Sky Bistro for our Anniversary. Our experience was amazing! The service we received from all staff members, from the parking lot to the top observation deck, exceeded our expectations! Every staff member we passed was professional, attentive, willing",

          "We went up Sulphur Mountain on the gondola and it was stunning! The price is rather high at $60pp, but it was completely worth it. I would definitely recommend checking the weather and going on a clear day, as I think that is what made it so amazing. There is a boardwalk up",
          "Staying in the Rimrock Banff, I was excited to get to the nearby gondola ride up to Sulphur Mountain. At the top, I was blown away by panoramic mountain views. I could see tons of mountains, lakes, and the town of Banff. The blends of white, green, and gray created bright,",

          "Surprisingly the gondola trip up to the top of sulfur mountain was smooth and pleasant and the views were breath taking. I just wouldn't try to look down if you're afraid of heights. There was a heated igloo on the viewing deck and a fire pit which helped with the wind chill.",
          "In the winter, you can hike the 5k trail up the mountain and take the gondola back down for free. Make sure you check when the gondola stops for the night. We almost didn't make it on. Thank you to the awesome guys running the gondola who let us on after it closed to the public!",
          "I brought my mom here 2 weeks ago, and she had so much fun. We went on a weekday and it was not overly busy which we were very happy about. The views were fantastic. It really made my mom appreciate how beautiful Banff is during the winter season.",
          "Really enjoyed riding the gondola. Great views of the town and you can see the Fairmont Banff Springs. I have been twice and they were both during the winter months. I would suggest bundling up because it can get really chilly as you walk towards to the weather station. The path",

          "We had a wonderful meal (best venison I have ever tasted) at the top of the Banff gondola. Great quality food, nice wine,. Very friendly staff. And we walked up (2hrs uphill) but could then get the gondola down for free. Only shame was we arrived just as it was getting dark so",
          "The view was spectacular and well worth the trip. We were there in December and it was very cold, so dress warmly. We plan on going back when it's warmer.",
          "I highly recommend this experience. Great Gondola ride but there is so much more!! The views are amazing. The hot chocolate is tasty. The exhibits are very interesting. We had the added bonus of catching the Alpenglow Festival with live entertainment and S'mores. We enjoyed",

          "Spectacular 360 views from atop the mountain overlooking Banff town and glimpse into Banff NP. Truly incredible to see the hands of the glaciers who carved the amazing scenery eons ago. A quick (10 mins or so) ride up gets you access to the museum, observation towers and gift",
          "My wife and I were staying in Banff at the Rimrock Resort during Christmas week 2019. On December 24 we woke to blue skies with nary a cloud in the sky. We decided to take to Gondola Ride to the top of the mountain range. It was a short walk to the admissions gate and ride",
          "Always a great outing view is magnifigant no matter the season or weather Worth going a few different times",
          "We hopped on the gondola for a quick trip up on a sunny day. I still find the trip up expensive, especially for a family. (An affordable family with teenagers price would have made this a five star review) It was windy at the top, but well worth the cold to get some beautiful",
          "While the ride up is quite something, once on the mountain, there is a boardwalk that goes over to the old weather station. The Center is nice and the Bistro was excellent.",
          "Very cool experience and the view is simply amazing, but it's a little pricy .. I would still recommend.",
          "This part of my tour was one of my favorites! I went on the Banff gondola with the Brewster Sightseeing Tour and this place is the reason why I fell in love with Banff and can't wait to go back. The gondola ride is less than 10 minutes and there's I believe 3 or 4 floors you can",
          "While expensive this is a great way to see gorgeous views as far as the eye can see. There is a walkway at the top up to sulphur mountain cosmic Ray station that is gorgeous. The building at the top has a huge interpretive exhibit to explore and several places to eat. We had a",
          "The views from the Banff gondola are exceptional. It is very well organised and the girl at the till was so friendly and helpful. We did have to queue, but it didn\u2019t seem to take long at all.",
          "My husband and I aren\u2019t great with heights, but it was worth going up on the gondola to experience the most amazing 360 degree views once you were at the top! It was the most breathtaking scenery everywhere you looked and so beautiful.",
          "The 8 min ride up gave us some of the most beautiful views of the surrounding mountains. I would suggest to give urself some time up there so u can see everything. We only had about 2 hours and after we ate at the Northern Lights Buffet (which had wonderful views and good food,",
          "This is one tourist experience you must do especially in the winter. It is so beautiful at the top. Two resturants, a roof top crstal igloo to get out of the cold. A trail from the bottom to the top is a two hour hike, there is a one mile trail on top to the next moutain top.",
          "For 65 cad you can spend mid day (maybe) having an amazing walk and view, incredible lunch with a view. I arrived at 10 am and left around 2 pm and had so much fun, take a lot of pictures!!",
          "Fabulous reliable service throughout our holiday, would definitely recommend, my wife and I had a great experience",

          "My boyfriend and I hiked Sulphur Mountain this week with the trail ending at the top of Banff Gondola. The observation building at the top is lovely and the views are spectacular!! And best of all the ride down to the base was free. Of note, this is a challenging hike even for",
          "We went up the Gondola and enjoyed it very much (besides the bad weather)!!! When we came back down we couldn\u2019t leave the parking lot due to the road being closed from bad weather. The staff accommodated us and said we could go back up to the top and they paid for our dinner as",
          "I travelled solo to Banff in the last week of January and had called the Gondola in advance to inquire about how much time the average traveller spends at this excursion, to which I was told roughly 1.5 hours.. I spent closer to 2! The Gondola itself is amazing. Each cabin is",
          "Suitable for a 3 year old. He loved the gondola. The views from the gondola and the terrace are just breathing. Very well maintained and they have a couple of very good dining options.",
          "The gondola is enclosed with big windows and the rides up & down were breathtaking. At the top there was much to see inside and the view outside was amazing. It was a fantastic experience!",
          "Breathtaking views. Make sure you have a drink at the restaurant. We bought T-shirts from the gift shop which supported Australia.",
          "The ride up and down was spectacular as always , however the 120 dollars during off season to get the 2 of us up and down was way out of hand , what the hell does it cost in peak season",
          "The gondola was a beautiful conclusion for a fantastic evening. My girlfriend and I rode the gondola, and it was her first time in the Banff area which she was thrilled. It is slightly overpriced for what it is but otherwise it was perfect",
          "Definitely a highlight of our trip. The views going up and all the way at the top are beautiful. I would recommend doing this if you're going to Banff",
          "The Banff Gondola was awesome. Great 360\u02da views of the city and mountains. Went back down after dark and they provided a warm blanket!",
          "We totally enjoyed this experience. It is not an inexpensive venture but worth the price. The views are incredible, there are tourist friendly walks and hiking paths, a nice gift shop and a fabulous restaurant! However, the views are supreme!!!",
          "We came right before sunrise on a Monday morning, and there was no line. This was a couple days after their annual (or monthly) maintenance. The ascend was smooth, peaceful, and quiet. We left the window open so that we can take unobstructed pictures of the view. It was",
          "Came here in mid-January and it was cold! Make sure to be warm and wear extra clothing, gloves and scarfs. The walk and view was breathtaking. I definitely recommend the ride.",
          "The Gondola Ride in Banff is a must, It surely shouldn't be missed! The view is just breathtaking, even more so in the winter--under the white twinkle of fallen snow. Words alone cannot express the beautiful view from the Gondola of the Canadian Rockies and Bow Valley. The",
          "summer please hike up n then come down on gondola . it is nice in summer but most beautiful in winter .",
          "We booked a meal at the restaurant on the top of the mountain and used the gondola to ascend. The actual cars were much smaller than we expected, sitting 4 comfortably, but 6 at a squeeze. Oddly there was no heating or lighting, which when it was -10 outside was quite surprising",
          "A few years ago was our fist trip to Banff and we made reservations for the Gondola and restaurant. That was our first day there and it set the tone for the rest of our trip at Banff. The view from the gondola was amazing but when we got to the top, the view was breathtaking!",
          "Fabulous vistas. This magical landscape which was transformed into a Winter Wonderland due to the 'once in a decade' dump of snow was incredible. The views from the top of the Gondola Walk are spectacular and must be experienced when you are in Banff, Sure it gets busy, but it",
          "My 13 son was terrified of the gondola ride, but the breathtaking views and delicious buffet was worth it!",
          "We had pre booked so we could walk straight in and get on the Gondola. Nice friendly operators. Up the top, was a great boardwalk to Sulphur Mountain with wonderful views. Lots of steps but I managed them all (375). We enjoyed our visit here",
          "My husband and two teenage sons and I went up the Sulphur mountain on the gondola in July, 2019. We arrived early and didn't have to wait long, though it was very busy. After a short and gentle ride, we arrived at the top and were ready to explore. There is a restaurant and",
          "A lovely fun day with family! My 8 year old daughter was very nervous about this trip yet she felt safe and really enjoyed it! Lovely views at the top with restaraunts and a cafe, gift shop etc. A great day overall.",
          "Great view of Banff and area best time to go is early as no lineups staff alway nice worth takining a few hours up there",
          "There is a hiking trail at the base of Sulphur Mtn. where the gondola is located. It is a 3.5 mile hike that has a 2200 ft. elevation change through a series of switchbacks. It is taxing to say the least but the views are well worth it! Once you hike to the top you can ride",
          "This is a must on your visit to banff fabulous views do it twice in the day and at night have the igloo with blankets and fire pit see the stars take a packed lunch prices in cafe expensive and take the walk to the top where the views and photo opportunities are amazing",
          "The scenery is absolutely beautiful going up the gondola, and when you get to the top it is just absolutely amazing. It is pricey but if you're from Alberta you get a bit of a discount, there are a couple restaurants and cafes and gift shops up on the top of the mountain, very",
          "It\u2019s a quick ride, but well worth it to get to the top of the mountain. I\u2019m the way and once you\u2019re there, it\u2019s such a beautiful view, highly recommended!!!",
          "My sister was out visiting so we decided to celebrate my birthday with a in Banff. It had been years since she had been on the Banff Gondola so we decided to check it out. They had it all ready for Christmas, including Santa! My teens rolled their eyes at me when I asked if they",
          "Loved it! Service was great and the views were second to none. It is freezing in winter but well worth it",
          "We visited the gondola two days after Christmas. Kids under 12 are free before noon, and you can catch the Banff ROAM public transit bus from town straight to the gondola. At the top, they had free fun holiday activities for kids (sparkle tattoos and cake pop decorating), and",
          "Went up with the gondola with the lunch package. Food is good and not to expensive. Views are fantastic in all directions. Walked all the way up to the old stone hut. It can be very cold up there. They say around 10\u00b0c colder than at the base house.",
          "Fantastic views, great restaurants at the top, highly recommended the sky bistro - I would score 5/5 for the food & service. We stayed at the Elk + Avenue hotel and received gondola tickets as part of our stay.",
          "Ok it\u2019s pretty expensive for a relatively short ride to the summit. The summit setup is good, but again not sure it\u2019s worth the cost. The view is good, but it\u2019s just another perspective on what you can already see from other viewpoints around Banff and beyond. If you have cash",
          "We arrived between 10-11 am, no lines, outstanding views, lodge at top with three levels. 10-15 minute walk outside on boardwalk to additional overlooks! Enjoyed very much!",
          "What an amazing way to travel up the mountain . The gondola runs on time and meets with the Bus schedules :)",
          "We were literally wandering through the woods and stumbled on the Banff Gondola - it was our first time in Banff and we didn't know this was a thing. It's really an experience you need to do if you're in Banff. Amazing views and just beautiful!",
          "We took the gondola up to Sulphur Mountain to taken in the view of Banff and surrounds. We were worried we wouldn\u2019t be able to see much as the weather was cloudy but we were surprised at how fast the clouds cleared and we had great views and then some times of white out. We",
          "Spectacular scenery, and great to be able to take the kids up! It was a bit pricey, especially for a family, but that's Banff I suppose. Options to eat up at the top which is nice.",
          "Very nice view up from the gondola. Should have a better rate to Alberta residence. I know there is a discount of 20%. I think it's not reasonable. But very good place to spend the day with your family.",
          "I took my mother for her first ride on the Gondola on Dec. 26th to see the views during the day and also to check out the Sky Bistro where I was taking her for dinner for her 96th birthday on the 27th. The views are beyond breathtaking, and the Interpretive Centre was very",
          "Whilst visiting Banff in September we took in Bow Falls and the gondola up the mountains. Good weather and brilliant scenery. Very clean and crisp mountain air. The views over the mountains and valleys from the platform at the top of the gondola were fantastic. Bow Falls down",
          "The price for a family to visit the Banff Gondola is outrageous. This uniquely Alberta activity used to be a must-do that I would recommend to anyone wanting to see the spectacular views of the Rocky Mountains. However, the price increase in the past couple years has made a",
          "See Banff from above. Boardwalk hike at top of mountain. Lots to do and see in visitors center. Can easily spend a few hours here!",
          "You can\u2019t go to Banff and not go on the gondola! It\u2019s an easy pleasurable way to get up to the top, where the views are just stunning! There\u2019s a couple of restaurant options at the top but you have to be lucky to get a window seat. You go in the Gondola in sets of 4 people,",
          "This place was truly breathtaking. We had a perfect day. The staff were al very helpful. The views were out of this world. We had lunch at the buffet located at the top and it was incredible. All the servers were so kind and helpful as well. 10/10",
          "All gondolas cost a little. This price is super reasonable, at around $60 Canadian. The ride up is only a few minutes but we\u2019ll worth it. Once at the top there are a few restaurants, one is a Buffett style. The information centre is great for the kids and the cafe great for the",
          "Definitely worth the ride up the mountain as the views are just magical. It takes about 8 to 10 minutes to go up and I was a little apprehensive as I am frightened of heights but it wasn\u2019t too bad but certainly worth the views when you get up there and on the way up.",
          "If you come to Banff you can\u2019t not go up the gondola. The view is like a postcard in every direction. The snow all around is just so pretty. The walk along the board walk is well worth it, but if it\u2019s winter you really need to be in ski gear as it is cold!! We had lunch at the",
          "Worth the price for the ride and the views. Stay rugged up as its a little colder at the summit Highly recommended.!",
          "Awesome ride and views from the summit. Employees went out of their way to help and explain things to us. A must do if your visiting Banff!",
          "Unreal experience! It was just as cheap to buy the normal gondola ticket as buying it with dinner at northern lights included over the Christmas week! We went up and spent about an hour looking around especially on the top observation deck then had our buffet dinner. The dinner",
          "Visiting Sulphur Mountain via the Banff Gondola was a great experience. The ride on the gondola was enjoyable, looking down was pretty cool. The views from the top were stunning, there was information to read as you went around, a fire pit for the sudden drop in temperature once",
          "I took my two teens, my 11 year old and my 20 year old niece for a ride on the gondola and a walk around Sulphur Mountain. It was quite a blustery day on the top of the mountain but I didn\u2019t hear one complaint. All 4 were thrilled with the experience and the multiple photo ops",
          "Lovely evening last night riding up and down the Banff Gondola and dinner at the top of Sulphur Mountain. Gondola staff were friendly and helpful with great attitudes and joking around with us. The views are spectacular, and the extra little touches like the blankets on the way",
          "Fabulous views from the top of Sulphur Mountain. A smooth 8 minute ride in a fully enclosed gondola (you can ope or close the side windows). Included in the admission were multiple interpretive displays and a short movie. There are two restaurants, a gift shop, a large outdoor",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Banff! We had perfect weather to see the spectacular winter views from the observation deck at the interpretive center. Lots of shops and restaurants, friendly staff and amazing gondola ride up to the top. Then, there is this huge boardwalk",
          "I purchased a banff winter package and the gondola was part of the package. The view is absolutely stunning, I recommend that everyone does this while in banff",
          "Positive emotions guaranteed. Have a long hike and elevate yourself to a 2000m highly above the sea level to freely experience the Canadian wild Rockies.",
          "We did not expect much to see when we embarked the gondola because they had a sign with \"limited visibility at the top\", which means practically that you waste your money. But we took chances and we were rewarded accordingly. By the time we arrived at the top and had lunch, the",
          "Get your tickets in advance. Minimal lineup. Incredible views of Banff and the surrounding mountains, but you\u2019re jostling with herds if tourists with selfie sticks. Small and rather mundane museum, but nice gift shop and the Sky Bistro is a pleasant respite from the crowds.",
          "Let's get the not so great part out of the way first, the gondola itself is expensive relative to other cable cars around the world that we have traveled on. To bring the cost down somewhat we packaged this up with a Discover Banff ice walk. We also observed people walking up",
          "Worth it to get the experience to see Banff from on high. But limited parking so better to get the shuttles or be able to Walk from a long distance where you are able to find a spot, or get there early",
          "My daughter was marrie din Banff and had 2 friends from Germany and 1 from Australia come to her wedding so we wanted to take them somewhere special and the gondola did the job. The views were breathtaking and we had lunch with outstanding service and food. Yes it is a bit",
          "There\u2019s no other way to appreciate the town of Banff and the park itself unless to go on top of Sulphur mountain. The gondola experience is amazing. The whole process is very well organized. Once you get on top, go to the 4th floor of the observatory to see the 16 peaks",
          "The observation deck offers a fantastic view! There is even a warm up \"igloo\" with chairs and blankets.",
          "This is the second time we\u2019ve been to the top of Mt. Sulpher via the gondola and the views do not disappoint. The ride up is beautiful and they gave us a blanket the put across our laps to help keep us warm (it was very cold outside). There are two dining options in the",
          "Stunning! Worth the $ but would recommend reservations to complete the visit with a meal overlooking the mountain grandeur And warm clothes!!",
          "Really enjoyed our ride to the summit of Sulphur Mountain and the views at the top were stunning. Only reason I didn\u2019t rate this a 5 is because I think it\u2019s a bit pricey ... $50 per person.",
          "When you are in Banff you cannot pass Sulfur Mountain, but Sulfur Mountain Gondola will take you there. BUT it\u2019s not just \u201ctransport\u201d, it\u2019s a moving viewing platform that allows you to look at the mountains from a constantly changing perspective. Of course you can use the Sulfur",
          "It was great to ride the gondola up the mountain to see some beautiful views of Banff and surrounding landscapes. There is a stair walk from the main building to a lookout. There are a few displays within the main building showing wildlife, history and interactive displays",
          "Really enjoyed seeing things from on the mountain. It was a bit cold, but very enjoyable! I would recommend you dress warm in winter so you can enjoy the view from outside.",
          "Nothing but great things to say about my experience here. All staff were very friendly. Great gift shops and food/beverage options. Plenty of seating. Fire pits. Educational information. The view is spectacular!",
          "This is one of the most jaw dropping beautiful views ever!! We had our Sunday lunch at the Sky Bistro. They had a carvery which was delicious and you could go back for more as many times as you wanted. It was only $27. There is a walk to a higher point which I found a little",
          "At just over 5000ft at the base station, this gondola takes you up to a magnificent view point with trails to the weather station & other parts of the mountain",
          "It was an amazing experience! The ride in the gondola was great - you just kept climbing. Once up top, the views were spectacular from every level. We had done a similar trip in the summer in Switzerland and this was as good, if not better! Since it was off-season, we didn\u2019t",
          "Very expensive as is all of Banff.you can hike up Sulphur Mountain but you need to be fit and take the gondola back down for free! Wonderful panoramic view",
          "It\u2019s like being on top of the world. The views were spectacular! The crisp mountain air is an added bonus. I\u2019d say a must do...and a bonus if you\u2019re an Alberta resident!",
          "We went up yesterday and loved it! Because it\u2019s close to Xmas the place was decorated so beautifully and the staff are warm and welcoming and helpful. This was a great day! The experience is approx 8 mins up and 8 down, who doesn\u2019t love a good gondola ride? up at the top is",
          "This is really worth doing, as the views are breathtaking, a 360 degrees around the Mountains, with views over Banff, the meandering river and up to lake Minnewanka. You can also do some more hiking and walking from the main viewing platform, but be prepared for many step up to",
          "Went up the gondola with the family for their first weekend of Xmas activities. Kids enjoyed cookie decorating, decoration making and a Santa visit.",
          "We would have given this attraction an excellent, except that the ticket prices seem a bit high. For us, we had relatives visiting so we splurged. That said, they have added a lot of features so a family could spend 2 or more hours here without a problem. The new building is",
          "Fantastic way to see the beautiful scenery from above. The ride up is incredible and then breathtaking from the top. Take the short and easy walk up to the old weather station at the top and enjoy the beauty from all vantage points",
          "Did breakfast at the top which was very nice to take in the scenery. Ride up was as breathtaking as the Vistage at the top. You can hang around the top, take in the beauty of the mountains and majestic power of nature. Felt very safe and stable on the way up. Workers are",
          "This was a great out. Went about 11am on the Gondola to the top and the restaurant, Walked to the top on the walk way although it a very cold day we thoroughly enjoyed the day. We used the restaurant for lunch and must admit the restaurant was very good as was the food. Met the",
          "The ride, the views, are well worth the price. There are a lot of photo opportunities and the ride up is magical. Must do!",
          "This was easily the highlight of my trip. I was lucky enough to have been watching the weather very diligently to ensure that I wasn't going to end up going up there while it was cloudy. The clouds were just starting to dissipate and I made my way there. There was pretty much no",
          "Afternoon run in gondola with limited view from cabin due to frost on glass. Once up on observation deck you can see miles into horizon those beautiful mountains",
          "The gondola ride up to the Northern Lights Cafe for lunch was very smooth and peaceful! The view of the area is breath taking my and a memory I will forever cherish!",
          "The only other gondola I\u2019ve ever been on was in the DR, I had no idea how different this would be. I loved that the gondola was small and just my friend and I were in it and we were able to sit. I loved that it has little windows that we could open to get the perfect pictures",
          "I've lived in the area for 3 years and had not yet visited the Banff Gondola - the experience was absolutely stunning! I very much enjoyed the little cable cars and our private ride to the upper station. The facility was very impressive with 4 levels including 2 restaurants,",
          "Great views of the surrounding area, there was a short queue either end , we spent around one hour at the top .",
          "We live in Canmore so we were taking advantage of a \u2018locals\u2019 special\u2019 which had the gondola ride included with a dinner reservation. The ride, the views, the exhibits, the welcome of the staff all made it most enjoyable",
          "The staff was kind and helpful, the views were breathtaking, and the gondola itself was comfortable and sheltered from the wind even on a very cold day.",
          "This is a must visit site while in Banff. There is countless views and vantage points to experience, as well as a hiking path to the summit which is easy to do with small children. The staff is very friendly and there is a lot of extra things to experience and enjoy a few hours",
          "A very easy trip. We just turned up, and were immediately able to board one of the gondola's. Fantastic views on the way up and down. The bus service back to town was very easy to use, and cheap. The only slight disappointment was the lack of a decent cafe at the top.",
          "Gondola crew was helpful and made ride very pleasant. Line was long but things went smoothly and quickly with very little wait.",
          "We visited on a late afternoon in early September really just to do a recce but as there was spaces in the car park and no queues at the ticket office we decided to do it there and then. I have to say that it is horrendously expensive at $70 per person (compare to Table",
          "Worth having a meal - great sunset view alongwith good wine and a surprisingly good meal- worth a visit",
          "We visited Banff Gondola in July and had a nice time. It was a short ride up the mountain, less than 10 minutes. The views at the top were beautiful. Definitely make sure to schedule enough time to walk along the boardwalk and enjoy the scenery from different viewing areas. We",
          "We had our trip booked but unfortunately, on the day we went, the weather defeated us. We did get to go on the Glacier Skywalk but the Glacier Tour was cancelled. The staff were great and refunded our money without question. We were travelling to Jasper a few days later and",
          "We took this ride in late October 2019, so it was a little chilly, but worth the price! I plan to return when it is warmer to explore the walkways",
          "What a pleasant surprise and an outstanding way to enjoy the Banff and Bow River Valley....from \"heaven's viewpoint\".. Take a shuttle from town since parking a over-crowded.",
          "Excellent experience to see the mountains. The Sky Bistro has excellent food and service. The boardwalk is a wonderful walk. You can spend at least 2 hours there.",
          "Beautiful trip up and back but the staff where so lovely and kind ! Made it an even better experience!",
          "i really recommend going up here, the price is worth it. no offence but better than the jasper one as there is more to do up there if its cold and you want to go inside. theres gift shops, a cafe, restaurants, there is a walk you can do at the top if you want even if its cold,",
          "Weather fairing this is by far the best way to see Banff in all it\u2019s charm. Tip - Park in town and take the shuttle up to the Gondola station. City parking is cheeped that parking at the hotel and there is very limited paring at the station.",
          "The gondola is well worth the costs. If you are considering skipping this site, don't. We were on the fence with this activity. After going up, the surrounding mountain peaks are spectacular along with the Bow River and the town of Banff. We had lunch at the cafe at the top and",
          "If you go to Banff, you need to do this, the views are absolutely gorgeous, it's an experience out of this world. And once you're on the top of the mountain, you got so many things to do, you definitely need to have dinner, the carvery is so nice!",
          "This is one thing you should definitely experience if you're in Banff. The ride itself is bloody amazing. We were four folks. On a busy day, the queue for the ticket can be long but they have many counters so it moves quickly as well. We hardly had to spend more than 10-15",
          "The first national park in Canada, this gondola ride is 8 minutes each way. At the top is a lovely visitors centre, stunning views and you can walk across to the original observatory. You can also hike up to this visitors centre. The day we went it had been snowing so we chose",
          "We took the 8 minute Banff Gondola ride to the summit of the Sulphur Mountain to experience the most enchanting and wonderful view of the Rocky Mountains; Snow had fallen and at the time of our arrival approx 9am in the morning, peace reigned, only the crunch of the icy snow",
          "Fabulous view and great lunch at the top!worth the price of the gondola. We hiked up and took the gondola down.",
          "This ride is a must do for sure. Each gondola holds four people and at the top there's an observation deck indoors and outdoors plus places to eat , a gift shop and a boardwalk to a higher viewpoint. We did the boardwalk and it's just over 1 km but has lots of steps along the",
          "Well worth the visit and do walk all the way to the top, its worth the effort. Great views from every spot, good exhibition and information areas.",
          "This ride is not cheap but it is a worthwhile experience. The view is magnificent and the observation/interpretation area is very well laid out. The actual gondola ride is fun and staff were friendly and professional. The hike to the old weather observation station is also very",
          "We booked a gondola ride and lunch at the Northern lights restaurant for a great price. The gondola ride itself is unbelievable and the views of Banff and the surrounding mountains is stunning! Reaching the top we explored the visitor center, which was beautiful and well thought",

          "If you go to Banff,don\u2019t miss to ride on their Gondola..It\u2019s quite expensive,but it\u2019s worth the ride...It takes 9 minutes to get there on top..We paid at least 300 dollars for five of us..But once you get there ,it\u2019s a million dollars view you got.Mountains are spectacular..We",
          "This is not just a usual gondola. It is way different than any other gondola just because if the beauty of Banff\u2019s nature. I traveled to Banff in June and I think it was one of the best seasons to go there especially that you can have sun light to almost 11 PM. The view from",
          "We really enjoyed the tram. We were there in off season (October) so lines moved quickly and we had a car to ourselves. The views are magnificent and you can hike even higher if you want to. It was very windy and cold when we were there so we did not hike up to the point. It was",
          "During our 3 days stay in Banff it was one of the highlights to take the gondola up to the mountain. The staff was extremely friendly and made us feel fully safe. I was a little bit afraid at first to get into the cabin, but since it has open window area, I did not feel",
          "The gondola was very smooth and took you up a long way up. The views from walkways were just spectacular .",
          "We arrived by shuttle not knowing where to go or what to do. Staff made the day very pleasant and enjoyable. Like talking to the Australlian staff and staff from all other countries.",
          "We visited the Banff Gondola in early October with our little girls and it was a fun day/ride. It is very windy up there, so make sure you bring warm clothes. Beautiful views await... The price of admission was raised considerably over the last 10 years, so be ready to pay a",
          "We weren\u2019t sure about riding in a gondola but decided to go with it. We are so glad that we did it!! The view from the top is spectacular. You can see the entire town of Banff and just amazing Mountain View\u2019s. Grab a coffee and danish or have dinner. A must see",
          "The Gandola provides a very efficient way up to the top of Sulfur Mountain. From here, you can see the town of Banff. I would recommend that you make reservations in the restaurant with a window seat overlooking the mountains. Also a great place to view the stars at night.",
          "As you can imagine the view is the best you will get in Banff. The ride up is comfortable and fun. Once at the top it is very nice. We had just eaten breakfast but wanted to enjoy the dining view. We chose the Bistro and shared the angus melt and fries. Sarah was SUPER nice",
          "Went for a meal in the mountain restaurant, so arrived at the base at 6 o'clock on a gorgeous clear evening , The meal although a bit on the pricey side was fantastic and so well timed so when we finished we witnessed the most fantastic sunset over the mountain.",
          "One of the most beautiful places to go. Love the ride up the mountain excellent view of Banff and a very friendly staff",
          "Wished I had known before booking our ticket that you would be jammed into a gondola with so many other people that you couldn't breathe, move or enjoy the scenery I wouldn't have gone. But once you get to the top its kinda worth it. Definitely worth the effort if you can make",
          "You absolutely must ride the gondola while in Banff!! Even for the faint-of-heart (like myself), the view from the top is so worth the trip up!!",
          "the day I went up there was a temperature inversion and you had to go through the clouds to get to the top but once you did the scenery was incredible - as close to heaven as you can get",
          "This is a must do! The view of the mountains and town is majestic. You must go eat at the top restaurant as it is delicious and go for a walk which is a very friendly one as they installed a boardwalk .",
          "Had tickets as part of our trip deal, both not great with heights but the staff were helpful and it wasn\u2019t that bad! Stunning views on the way up and down and very smooth. Well worth it to get to the top of the mountain to get more stunning views of the local area",
          "Awesome experience!! Even better than when we went 10 years ago!! Restaurant upgraded and wonderful!!",
          "Amazing views from the top. It is up to 10 degrees colder at the top (more with wind factor) so take some layers. There is a walk just off the top and is worth the small hike up the stairs. The 360 degree views are awesome.",
          "Keep your cameras ready,open the window n click some breathtaking photos. Could not get enough......",
          "The Banff Gondola has a free shuttle from the Banff business district. We were told public transit also makes the round trip. Since the parking lot was undergoing maintenance and repacking, we took the shuttle. The weather was quite unsettled during our visit and we purchased",
          "Loved Sulpher Mountain. Climbed to the top, invigorating. Ate at Northern Lights which was fabulous. Highly recommend.",
          "We were fortunate to have Andrew as our tour guide and had such an amazing day. The company was professional and provided food throughout the day. There were stops at Lake Louise, Alabaster Glacier and the Icefield Skywalk. It was such an awesome day, I highly recommend this",
          "The whole experience was just so much more than a simple Gondola ride -- a short trek once at the top provides truly amazing views of the surrounding mountains. Absolutely breathtaking !!! You may even be lucky to see a few mountain goats up top! Highly recommend including the",
          "Something you just HAVE to do when you are in Banff. Gondola holds 4 people. Views from the top are exquisite (of course, you would want to do it on a sunny day.) Dress in warm layers so you are comfortable at the top. Plan on at least an hour to hang at the top so you can",
          "The Banff Gondola is a must-do activity in Banff. The 360 degree views from the top are absolutely magnificent. The boardwalk to Sulphur Mountain is excellently maintained and provides spectacular scenery all along the route. We had excellent weather albeit cold; however, even",
          "Definitely a must whilst in Banff. Superb views from the top, try and go up on a clear day. We went at 5pm after a busy day exploring.",
          "Incredible beautiful awe-mazing view, we celebrated our 40th anniversary on top of Sulfur mountain and dinner at the Sky Bistro. Everything was incredible! Best time ever",
          "Highly recommend while in banff. Utilise the free shuttle that leaves regularly from town and takes you right to the front door. Really quick efficient system. All the area on top of the mountain is boarded so simple to walk for all abilities, there are steps outside too but the",
          "2 km to the peak of Sulphur Mountain in a gondola! What a joy. At the top, 360 degree views of a snowy wonderland from an outside terrace (with fire pits) or inside restaurants. I was even lucky enough to be lightly snowed on. You can take a short walk to a weather station. You",
          "Amazing trip!!! Gondola ride was so fun (and smooth)! Had a delicious lunch at Northern Lights Cafe!!! Great hiking and view from the top! It is a MUST if you are in Banff!",
          "Excellent trip up the Mountain. Staff at the Gondola were fantastic. Friendly and responsible. Love the guys. Great job and keep up the exceptional team work. The trip up the mountain is very beautiful and scenic. You could see the city of Banff. The exhibits were very",
          "Worth the price. The views are off the charts stunning and the food was better than expected. We found it pretty to kill 2 plus hours exploring the board walk and viewing deck. It is a must see. I recommend seeing this in a shoulder season as it appears the crowds can be HUGE",
          "People say that the pictures don't do it justice, and it's true. When I saw the price, I tried to talk my husband out of it, but I'm so glad I listened to him. A once in a lifetime experience for sure. The ride up was lovely, and the hike at the top was gorgeous. We took a",
          "LOVED this experience but didn't alott enough time to enjoy. Try to do it at sunset. For an extra special experience, dine at Sky Bistro. The clouds were continuoulsy shifting and the views were incredible. In the summer they have live music we enjoyed listening to very much",
          "On the recommendation of a local tour guide, my partner and I headed up the Banff Gondola for the first ride up at 8am (14 October). We were the only ones there (plus a handful more over the next hour), and it was 100% worth it. a) for the magnificent view at sunrise and b)",
          "The weather was very clear and enjoyed being at top of mountain. Enjoyed well made cocktails at sky bistro. A bit expensive, but its worth to be there and get life time experience",
          "This is a must-do when in Banff!! The view is amazing and the dining at the top of the mountain is superb.",
          "Great panorama over banff and surrounding area. The boardwalk takes you even higher and is well worth the effort, and the expense.",
          "We made the journey North to participate in the Icefield and Sky walk experiences and were not disappointed. It is a little expensive and if not booked in advance, leads to waiting in lines. The Skywalk is very interesting and a fab Engineering feat for sure, not ideal if you",
          "While it can be busy at times, this is still a destination worth it each time. The view and the hike at the top is more than it looks like from most pictures. The food in the cafeteria is actually pretty decent for a tourist spot. We have been twice in a year and will definitely",
          "If in Banff this is a must do! View was spectacular an the gondola and on top of mountain a lovely facility for getting a snack With a very interesting museum. We were stunned to see our hotel down below in this distance the Fairmont Springs, just lovely.",
          "We had (on advice) prebooked this trip whilst in Banff for a couple of days. On arrival the weather had worsened and the summit was completely shrouded in cloud. We asked for a refund or a reduction but no luck. So went up and found it wet and a whiteout although we have to say",
          "Great views from the Gondola and from the top of the mountain. Lovely area to look over Banff and the surrounding mountains. Well worth the walk along the boardwalk to very top as you will get some amazing pictures.",
          "Beats walking to the top! Efficient when we were there. Nice views from the top. Same gifts were cheaper in town so maybe skip the gift shop that\u2019s at the top and just enjoy the view. Windows open on one side of the gondola so grab one of those for best photos.",
          "This is a must do in Banff. It is expensive but the views from the summit are spectacular and 360 degree. Make sure you walk up to the summit, which is the weather station - the views get better and better. Obviously worth considering the weather and visibility when going on",
          "Definitely bring your camera and be sure to wear a winter coat as it is 10 degrees cooler at the top (and a lot more windy). Each gondola seats 4 people, the ride up takes less than 10 minutes, and you climb about 2,300 feet. The scenery is spectacular! There were snow flurries",
          "What a great way to spend a few hours. The ride up on the gondola is a treat. Beautiful views all around and then you reach the top! 360\u00b0 of breathtaking scenery. We were lucky that it had snowed and we were witnessing a winter wonderland. There are two viewing levels, one has",
          "I was a little bit hesitant spending what little time we had in Banff taking on gondola ride, however it was well worth it. While we like to hike the views from the top of the gondola are incredible, and lead to some nice little walks around the top of Sulphuric Mountain.",
          "We took the Banff Gondola ride as part of the Ultimate Rockies Explorer Ticket which we booked before leaving the UK. It also gave access to Lake Minnewanka cruise, and the Columbia Icefield adventure and the Glacier Skywalk. This worked out too be much better value than booking",
          "We were lucky to go up on a very clear day and the views were amazing. Plenty to look at and do when you get up to the top and very clean.",
          "The gondola ride was great and the views from above were amazing. Be sure to walk the boardwalk from the Sky Bistro to the Cosmic Ray Station. It's a must! The panoramic views are amazing and the food was very good.",
          "We went on a day that it was snowing pretty hard which made the views up top not as spectacular but boy is it amazing! The ride up is breathtaking and the complex beautiful. We enjoyed a cocktail in the bar which watching the snow fall. Don\u2019t miss the opportunity to take it to",
          "This was overall a good experience.The guides were very informative .The walk was extremely slippery.We felt slightly uneasy about the trip because we expected it to be more controlled with regards to numbers.We were constantly told that they were preserving the area but we felt",
          "The gondola is very nice, though I would recommend the hike up the mountain, it is much more scenic.",
          "My husband is NOT in favor of gondola riding, but even he had a nice time. It is very well organized--we got on right away and were given an approximate time to head back down the mountain. When you arrive at the top, there is a big outdoor deck for taking photos and a lot of",
          "It\u2019s a little pricy, but the views are worth it and the food was great. Try going at sunset. Recommended.",
          "We were in Banff and took the 8 minute gondola ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain. The views are spectacular. We had a perfectly clear day. A great way to see a panoramic view of the area.",
          "We were debating going to Lake Louise gondola or Banff. Lake Louise much cheaper, but only has a small viewing area on top and some trails. Banff Gondolas were more expensive but worth the price. Ride takes about 8 minutes to the top, there is a restaurant and look out, plus",
          "We made reservations on line which enables us not to go in lines and straight onto gondola at specific times . A must do as views are incredible . Starbucks and Resto on top as well . If October, dress warmly !",
          "Blustery day that ended up dropping some snow while visiting the top. Be sure to head up to the lookout. Wonderful, well thought out facility. Very clean and breathtaking.",
          "Yes it's expensive but it's a must do activity of the weather is good and you're in Banff. We waited until the night before to book online, but ended up being an hour earlier than we thought - they didn't say anything and we went straight through. Fantastic views and a good",
          "For foreigners, this deal is $3 cheaper than ticket prices on-site. However, as an Alberta resident, I was supposed to get $10 off each but nowhere mentioned at here. The bistro provides quality food with decent price ($27 - buffet). A server named \"Oh Boy\" interacts with",
          "The staff were all friendly The gondola is quite steep and has beautiful scenery around while on the gondola and also on the top very pictures",
          "We expected an enjoyable, smooth ride up the mountain with great views. We got that and more! The facility at the top of the lift is very impressive. Several floors (all elevator-accesible and surrounded by glass so you never have to leave the outdoors very far behind), with",
          "I was a little nervous to go up in the gondola but I am so glad that we did. The view was out of this world when you reached the top. The have a restaurant and bar at the top and a gift shop. What a great experience!!!!",
          "Very friendly people! Nice view, but I would tell people not to do this when it's cloudy or misty. We were disapointed.",
          "If your going to Banff (which I recommend because it's possibly the most magical place I've ever been to) then you have to do this. The views from the top are breathtaking, I've hardly seen better anywhere. If you eat at the top, I suggest you spend a little more and go to Sky",
          "Try to get there early and do the boardwalk before bus crowds arrive. It was snowy when we were there, but the vistas were amazing. Top level has heaters and chairs to sit around and the views......",
          "Even the ride itself was very scenic. Lines moved quickly. Be prepared for different weather at the top. The views are incredible and the facility at the top is very nice.",
          "Buy the one way gondola trip and hike down. Takes about 1-2 hours but totally worth it! You\u2019ll spend about 3-4 hours enjoying yourself. They also have a Starbucks at the bottom of the gondola.",
          "The 8 minute ride to the mountain top was super, but being on top of the mountain was awesome. Well worth the trip for the outstanding views!!",
          "Very pleasant ride up and down. Very scenic views. The lunch buffet at the top was great. Reasonably priced.",
          "A little pricey, but well worth the ride up and down. Make sure you take a fleece as the temperature gets cold on top. Go all the way upstairs top floor to get scenic views and photographs. Comfortable chairs there. The boardwalk is paved and well laid out to stroll basically",
          "Anybody in the area with any disposable income should ride the gondola to the top. Good trails. the ski life on the other side of the Trans-Canada highway is cheaper and just as good. you can ride it up and eat/drink and you can take some great photos.",
          "I went on this trip whilst staying in Banff. It really exceeded my expectations, as I didn\u2019t realise you could walk around so much outside and go up to an observation deck. I actually spent about a couple of hours up there once arriving in the gondola. It was a great experience",
          "This was my second time visiting the Banff Gondola. However It is not a cheap ride up-but nothing is cheap in a National Park. The views are spectacular! It did snow while we were up there as well but cleared out so we were able to enjoy the views again.",
          "We were in two minds as whether to take the gondola because of the price but we were glad we did. The views were amazing and the exhibits interesting. Worth going if you can afford it.",
          "Excellent activity. The views are awesome and the food at the Northern Lights Buffet was superb waiters, especially Harry, were friendly and attentive. The view was awesome",
          "This is not cheap over 130 dollars for 2 people, however when you are there the views are stunning. We were there just after it snowed and it looked magical. The observation deck has fire pits and chairs so take your coffee up there to drink much nicer than sitting in the cafe.",
          "We visited today, the visibility was good but not great.. the tops of several mountains were cloud covered, we did check the 360 camera online when deciding whether to go up. I was carrying a toddler on my back in a carrier and still managed to make it slowly to the weather",
          "We went up the mountain on a rather cold, blustery day, but the ride was very smooth. The views over Banff and the surrouding area were spectacular. The museum, etc at the top of the mountion were extremely interesting",
          "Gondola was an easy ride up. We enjoyed the views and views and information about the area from the top. We had a great meal at the upscale restaurant and the fun drinks made it even better. Great way to experience the mountain top.",
          "Superb views of Banff and surrounding vista and mountain range. Just watch for the weather as it can change very quickly. Free bus to and from Town or just $2 each way. plenty of bus stops in town. You can see the Gondola going up the mountain from the Town centre on a clear",
          "This was like being on top of the world the views were aamazing.It was very busy but everywhere was accessible, the staff were great with lots of laughter. A really enjoyable experience",
          "It cost $132 for the two of us to ride the gondola, which we thought was very expensive. There is no way I would buy a ticket unless it was a very nice clear day, because if it is cloudy, your views will not be very good, and that\u2019s why you go up there. If you do go on a clear",
          "Although I am scared of heights I am very glad I braved this gondola trip as the views at the top are spectacular. We travelled to and from the gondola on the free Banff Gondola Bus which stops on the main street in town. Next time we would book a meal in the restaurant at the",
          "The Banff Gondola Ride is a Not to be missed attraction. The Gondola ride was a smooth and easy way to trek up to the Mountain Top. Of course the views were amazing, no where else can you see this far with no interference.",
          "I was quite nervous but it was an amazing experience and the snow was magical. It\u2019s a very smooth ride and no bumps.",
          "It was really beautiful, really recommend it to every one, the view was excellent even in this season",
          "A great way to see Banff. Take a ride up the gondola to experience breathtaking scenery. The ride was smooth.",
          "We\u2019d pre booked our tickets so walked straight in. Amazing views from the moment you go up. It was a cloudy snowy day but we still had good sights to see all around. Well worth taking the walk from the gondola station to the look out point. Helpful friendly staff al around. We\u2019d",
          "I'm terrified of heights but it was something to do. Unfortunately it was cold, windy, and snowing so there was a bit of swaying. Other than that it was beautiful.",
          "We visited during September (part of the four experience deal), all was quiet and so no queues. Well worth the trip to the top, amazing facilities and onward board walk to the top of Sulphar Mountain",
          "We took advantage of a break in the clouds and shuttled up to this. Great views from the efficient cars and they have taken a lot of care to make the centre attractive with a 360 deg platform walk and lots of interesting exhibits including the citizenship chair",
          "The boardwalk is great, however there were SO many people up the top. If you don't like crowded tourist attractions - skip this.",
          "The ride up the mountain is fairly short but but the top of the mountain is amazing. There are some exhibits and there is a boardwalk to a former weather observatory. The walk is a bit longer than you might think; but it is a fun walk. Great views for pictures. The tickets had",
          "Definitely worth visiting. Great for families, take the time to walk the full boardwalk as the view fr9m the top is stunning. A slow walk will be about 30 minutes but lots of steps but a relatively easy walk. Restaurant at the top lovely and lots of educational areas for",
          "Disappointing, to begin with we started in Banf but spent considerable time with other pickups as far as Lake Louise . Our Driver went in for far too much detail a lot of it irrelevant. A bit of quiet time just to enjoy the scenery would have been better by far !!",
          "We hiked up Sulphur Mountain, and took the Gondola back down - the views from the top were indescribable - the pictures don't do it justice. It's incredibly cold at the top, but there are firepits around so that you can spend plenty of time enjoying the views before heading back",
          "This gondola is solely for sightseers, so there were no skiers/snowboarders lugging their gear onto the gondolas. The staff was incredibly efficient, making it easier to purchase tickets and get on board. A piece of advice: face out with your back to the mountain so that you",
          "A good review from someone very afraid of heights, So the ride up for me was not pleasant but the other couple riding with us said to just look at her face and keep talking so I survived the ride up. Once I got to the top I was like a little kid running around taking all the",
          "Excellent, beautiful views, well worth going. Free bus service so very easy access. No waiting as we went early",
          "Can get very busy. However worth doing the views are out of this world. Worth walking out to Sansons Peak on the boardwalk. Stunning. Cafes at top quite expensive though",
          "Overall a super neat experience. The trip up or down takes about 8 minutes. Gondalas hold 4 people. If they are not busy a group of two will be seated alone. Best seating for pictures is face down slope. We had just several minutes long line up for a Gondala on the upload, on",
          "You must take the Banff Gondola at least once in your life time if you could! Great opportunity to take photos which you would not be able to take from the ground. The wait time could be up to 15 minutes but worth it.",
          "We rode up the mountain in a comfortable gondola. The ride was pretty quick, with little waiting time. Once on top we were greeted with beautiful views of the mountains. This was a cool way to see the Canadian Rockies. Lots to do on top, the short movie was ok.",
          "I walked up and took the gondola back down -- which apparently is pretty common. I didn't realize how much there was to do and see at the Gondola Center at the top of the mountain, and I ended up spending almost two hours there (including a quick lunch). While some might think",
          "Unless you are a experienced hiker you will never see this view. Everyone can spend time on top of a mountain overlooking Banff, AMAZING view. If you choose there are trails to walk up or down the mountain, so you can purchase a one way ticket on the gondola. 2 to 3 hours to",
          "We chose the cheaper (after 5.00 p.m.) tickets but they let us on about 4.30 anyway. Good place to view the surrounding National Park. Really pleasant to find fire pits as well as in early September it was quite windy and chilly. Well worth the fee.",
          "it is a must do on a nice clear day in Banff. it wasn't cheap but worth it for the views and walks once up the top.",
          "If you are spending more than one day in Banff, this is worth spending half a day on. The trip to the top is thrilling , views are magnificent and for those hearty souls, you can climb even further to the true summit but beware, you are at 9K feet and the air is THIN. The",
          "The young people working here were so pleasant and efficient, you didn't have time to get nervous. You were just OFF and away. Totally enclosed, even my skittish husband was OK with the rides up and down. Don't miss the Sky Bistro at the top. There's a package deal.",
          "We were fortunate to have a nice clear day for our visit. I had bought tickets online to save time so we were able to go straight to the loading area of the gondola. Short line and within a few minutes we were on our way to the top. My wife and I were able to have a gondola",
          "though we found the prices quite stiff - considering a limited stay up - it really was a fantastic stay up there on the observation desk. Marvelous views: mountains, rivers....all there! Especially when there is sunshine a brilliant trip. Enjoy a glass of wine near a fireplace",
          "Went on a very clear day and could see mountains all around including those close to Lake Louise, a lot of steps to the top of dome.",
          "Dustin (driver) and Jack (host) could not have been better. Both were knowledgeable speaking about the scenery and sharing personal insights that were very interesting. Saw many sights driving up Icefields Parkway. Stopped at Bow Lake. Saskatchewan Lake stopped for bus-side tea,",
          "We were fortunate enough to go on the gondola \ud83d\udea0 on a bright, crisp and clear Autumn day, with views to die for. I forgot my fleece, and had to buy clothing and other goodies at the shop at the visitor centre at the top. It\u2019s well stocked, reasonably priced and was very busy.",
          "Wrap up well. It's certainly colder up there than down on the ground. And leave the hat behind. It's pretty windy up there as well We booked for 1710 hrs on a Sunday evening but if was still pretty busy and we only just about managed a parking space in the higher, Hot Springs,",
          "Beautiful scenery during the ride up and from the top of mountain! If you're going to be in Banff - don't miss it!",
          "This was one of the highlights in Banff. The view up the mountain and at the top was breathtaking!! The staff was well organized and the line up moved very quickly. There were many \u201cmuseum like\u201d exhibits and short films. I highly recommend the gondola ride!!",
          "$70 for round trip no more free ride down if you hike up. Just another price gouge with the price doubling in ten years. Incredible view but it\u2019s painful to spend that much on just the ride. Skip the food at the top it\u2019s nothing special and very expensive. You will enjoy the",
          "Gondola trip was part of the Rocky Mountaineer rail trip package so the price did not come into it. As everybody has said the ride is invigorating, the views spectacular and the info at the top is very informative, had a decent cup of tea up there as well",
          "Only choose a clear day to splash your cash on this one. The views are outstanding but the climb - via steps for the last bit, many many steps - needs stamina. Everything in Canada was at least three times anything comparable in UK. And the gondola is no exception.",
          "First stop while in Banff. Nice way to see the area. Walked the deck to several level and see the complete valley. Enjoyed the observation deck next to a couple of fire pits and heaters. Quick and easy.",
          "Go early in the morning and you will be delighted at the great views of Banff. Although pricey, this gondola is worth it for the views.",
          "Worth the trip up! An opportunity to walk upstairs to a higher point. Spectacular views. Interesting information. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.",
          "If you want to see the vie around Banff - and can\u2019t hike up yourself - well worth the over $50 each. I guess you\u2019d pay that to have someone carry you up and down?",
          "Marvelous views of the Rocky Mountains. Lucky for us, the weather was sunny. The beef meat cheff (OH BOY, such a lovely person) served us excellet beef briscuit.",
          "My husband and I visited mid September and it was a lovely experience. We did not need to queue for long, the actual gondola only took about a minute to reach the top. There was more at the top than I had imagined and the views were amazing. We had already been on the Jasper",
          "We took the gondola, although rather expensive $60/person. But glad we did as we got a beautiful clear blue sky day to see the Canadian Rocky Mountains in all their grander!! It did not disappoint us!! Amazing beyond our expectations. Would I spend that kind of money",
          "Prebook your departure time and walk straight on. Brilliant views and walks at the tip. Allow 2 hours at the top.",
          "TOP TIP: Ok so we booked to go on this the day before we were due to do it. We waited for the weather to be just right and because of this we got fantastic views. A lot of people tend to complain about weather and refunds etc but common sense you dictate that the company cannot",
          "A must visit. The trip up is amazing. At the top make the effort to climb the peak. Worth it for the pic. Also make sure you go to the roof top. There is a cafe for a quick bite or coffee. This is a must while in town. It was not busy when we went but it looks like it could be.",
          "Our driver and guide was Mike and let me tell you, he\u2019s a total gem! He was so knowledgeable about the area and made extra stops for us to get photos and check out the wildlife. He really made the day extra special! He even gave us locally baked cookies. We saw a grizzly and",
          "The views ! Clean rest rooms Nice coffee Great ride Well worth it ! Lots of happy patrons Lovely outdoor fires",
          "We enjoyed the Gondola as part of the dinner package which we booked ahead. Great views from the top and a small museum. The meal at Sky Bistro exceeded our expectations.",
          "Don\u2019t skip this. The views are spectacular. As a local, it\u2019s easy to sometimes take the mountain views for granted. This place doesn\u2019t disappoint and makes you realize how lucky you really are to be in such a beautiful place. You can hike up or use the gondola. Very",
          "We rode the gondola up Sulphur Mountain on a cool and rainy day last week but the weather didn't affect the amazing experience of feeling as if we were in the clouds and on top of the world. The ride and views were exciting and memorable. We visited as part of a tour, so didn't",
          "The view of Banff and around are stunning but the Lake Louise gondola is better value. Around Can$130 for 2 for Banff one vs about $50 for 2 for Lake Louise one.",
          "Very quiet smooth ride to top. Building at top excellent as has been renovated. Observation decks on two levels. Good gift shop. Trip down just as good.",
          "Well worth the drive up the mountains. Wonderful views Great experience. So nice to sit there drink coffee and look at the mountains",
          "Do yourself a favour, go up the Banff gondola. It might be a bit scary if you're afraid of heights (I am!) but it's so so so so worth it!",
          "Super thing to do. We to parking, found a spot, bought tickets and enjoyed for several hours. Parking was very lucky. They offer a shuttle from town and in busier season would be best. I enjoyed the board walk from center to the \u201csummit. It\u2019s the closest that I will get to a",
          "A fabulous experience with amazing views. Great food at the top and wonderful staff at every level. A great memory",
          "The only critter we saw was a black bear foraging for berries. Since we see these all the time in our backyard, it wasn't a big deal",
          "This is an amazing way to spend the day. Take the Gondola to the top, have lunch and then hike around a little before you go down. We planned for three hours and were a little pushed to get in all that we wanted. Don't skimp on time at the top.",
          "This is our second trip on the gondola up to the summit. The first time was for Christmas then this year was summer. It rained on us but it did not spoil the outing at all. The ride up was nice and dry in the gondola and the staff was excellent. Once at the summit the views",
          "Take you to the top of Mountain Sulphur. Where you can walk to other peaks of mountains and enjoy the views of lakes from above. Amazing on how well it is constructed. Paved floors and stairs for a easy enjoyable views from high in the sky!",
          "The views as you ride up the mountain are breathtaking, and once you get off, you can walk up to the top of Sulphur Mt. It's a steady incline of steps and a path but well worth it.",
          "The Banff gondola ride is a great way to get mountain views with out having to actually climb the mountain. Well organized and run, it is a quick trip to the top. Several restaurants are found at the summit. Views are fantastic. Make sure to watch the video.",
          "Over looking Banff great plaques describing the view of all the mountains. Even has additional path of steps to the peak where a weather station is. Clouds are frequented but we were lucky to have some breaks in the clouds",
          "We visited this Restaurant at 18:30 on a beautiful early autumn evening to experience the mountain sunset whilst eating dinner. We were not disappointed. The cost of the dinner and Gondola ride was, for us from the UK extremely high, but we do treasure an evening to remember.",
          "went up about 7pm to catch the sunset - unreal views and wasn't too busy. Have seats out side with fire pits so if your dressed for the chilly weather you can relax there for a while. Even though restaurant was fully booked - got seats at the bar for some drink before heading",
          "Took an early ride at 9.00 so missed the crowds but getting busy when we left as bus tours were arriving. Fantastic views from the top of Banff and surrounding mountains. We took the ROAM bus from near our hotel so no worries about parking either.",
          "Took trip to the top with lovely views. Well worth the money . Staff very friendly and helpful and willing to,answer any questions.",
          "Really well done here. Queue moves quickly. Food at both stations. Excellent hike up to the station on the Boardwalk. All the staff exceedingly friendly. Great work. Must see when here.",
          "Booking ahead was so easy! The gondola ride is a must do in Banff. The views are spectacular! Lunch at the top was delicious.",
          "The only irritating aspect of the gondola ride was the price. It was $70.45 per person. The better aspects were; maximum of 4 people per gondola, excellent views (hint: travel backwards going up the mountain. Better photos), and the very professional and likable staff. We",
          "family of 5 went for a few hours. Amazing views very good experience. 2 negatives though, its quite expensive, 89 dollars each, and you cannot buy a ride up and walk down ticket. Also there is restricted places where you can buy a coffee at the top. Very disappointing.",
          "The Banff Gondola is super busy (for good reason) so I would recommend going during off-peak hours. We purchased our tickets online (highly recommended) to skip the line. Parking is tight but there are two lots (a higher elevated lot that's meant for the Upper Hot Springs). The",
          "This is a must. DO NOT go to Banff & miss taking a gondola ride up Sulphur Mountain. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking, across the whole of the town of Banff & the surrounding mountains. There is a lovely board walk you can stroll along at the top and if you\u2019re",

          "The ride is smooth. Lovely views on the way up and down. The walking area, sightseeing, restaurant and gift shop are a bonus. This is worthwhile.",
          "This was an excellent tour through a truly breathtakingly beautiful area. The guide was very knowledgeable and helpful and everything ran really smoothly. There were plenty of photo opportunities and rest breaks which made a long day seem not so long. Lunch was a buffet and",
          "My husband and I took this gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain. The ride was great. At the top we walked around on the walkway, admiring the mountains on all sides. We enjoyed the video, which gave the history of banff. Several other areas gave interesting historical facts.",
          "Wow, the views from up on Mt Sulphur were absolutely breathtaking. Great views of the Banff township. There is a restaurant up on the mountain and a gift shop. Also coffee and snack options. Well worth a visit",
          "A must do when you visit Banff, but try to go early we went at 8.15 am. Not very busy then walked all the way to the Cosmic Ray station ,fantastic views 360 degree. Lots to see but the weather will make a big difference, our visit was in perfect sunshine, slightly expensive but",
          "Well we had this included in our tour but when we got to Banff it rained the day we went and you couldn\u2019t see anything due to fog and bad weather. We were looking forward to this as a gondola ride in Australia is rare.",
          "What a magnificent place to visit. The views are stunning. You can see all of Banff from the top. Great fire pit seating and restaurant and coffee shop. Well worth a visit. Not for people who are frightened of hights",
          "My fianc\u00e9 and I rode the gondola up to Sky Bistro to celebrate our engagement. Though the food was really great, the prices were high and the service was slow. The views from on top of the mountain, though, were spectacular!",
          "I think it's a complete rip off but it's something to do...the boardwalk-thing at the top of sulfur mountain is a nice stroll but it can be quite chilly. Bring a coat - definitely glas i had gloves and a hat as well.",
          "A must-see while in Banff. The gondola ride is fun,views are stunning, and the food at Northern Lights restaurant was great!",
          "Incredible views. Faculty is awesome. Staff friendly and well trained. The views are incredible. Truly awesome.",
          "A serious gondola ride up to the top. The gondolas are comfortable 4 person units. Quite steep, but not as bad as the Table Mountain one in Capetown, S.Afr. Stunning 360 views from the top of the building that has a couple of restaurants and bars ( not tried). lots of regional",
          "We spent about 2.5 hours total (shuttle to attraction, gondola, walking around, gondola back down, etc.) and we were so glad we decided to try this! The views are really amazing (we had a very clear and sunny day). There's lots of information about the Rockies at the top (you",
          "The gondola is great. Only four to a car and as it wasn't busy we could go as a couple. We had good views up and down. There is a great walk up higher to the old weather station. Very safe and great views. Food expensive.",
          "What a day trip this is. Even on a cloudy day it was well worth the trip. The outside boardwalk to the summit is worth the effort but hard going, forgot to count the steps. Called in for a bite to eat in the buffet all you can eat restaurant, excellent.",
          "We ate at Sky Bistro next to the window so it was an awesome view. Even though the day before I did already ride a gondola at Sunshine Village, I was still scared riding the gondola. The thing freaks me out, but I managed. Totally worth it. I didn't bother with the interactive",
          "We visited in a cloudy day unfortunately but it was still a great experience. A nice ride up the mountain on the gondola, then after looking out from the observatory we walked along the boardwalk. We sat for ages watching the clouds moving across these mountains. One minute",
          "Worthwhile. Get the package and have dinner at Sky Bistro. Great seafood chowder! Wonderful views great experience.",
          "Lots to see and do but we had booked in advance and it rained all day. Views were not so good. But we didn\u2019t let that ruin the ride!",
          "The Banff Gondola is very popular and some people make reservations while others take a chance on finding a parking spot at random times. An alternative is the gondola + chairlift experience at Sunshine Village not far from Banff which is less crowded but a great experience",
          "Great view and excellent food in the Bistro. Staff were really friendly. The other problem was the queue coming down as the gondola was slowed so the photographer could take photo and you could purchase them at the bottom. We did not have our taken.",
          "Even on a rainy day it was worth a visit. Views of Banff were excellent. We paired our gondola trip with the Sky Bistro restaurant for a very enjoyable dinner.",
          "Pricey to go up, but well worth it for the views. The time allocated tickets mean little queuing but they can be amended if you miss your slot as we did, overstaying lunch in the Bistro.",
          "This was an awesome trip. Views from the top are incredible! There are walkways which allow 360 views of the surrounding area. Well worth the time to visit.",
          "We so enjoyed the ride on the Banff Gondola. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation (took a taxi so we didn\u2019t have to deal with parking) and luckily beat a tour bus, so we got right on. The staff was friendly and worked fast but we never felt rushed. Such a beautiful ride",
          "you're on top of the world at this attraction. we went up early and got to see the sun rise over the mountains. handicap friendly. staff are helpful and courteous. not to be missed",
          "It is expensive but worth the money. Views from the top are incredible if the weather cooperates. Make sure you check the weather prior to buying tickets. Walk to the Summit about 30 min via stairs, not too strenuous. More great views.",
          "The staff at the Gondola were amazing, chatty and some very interesting. Staff at the viewing sites too were all lovely and helpful. Coffee amazing up there! Views are great and on a clear day so great to photograph. Some wildlife to spot too, chipmunks and deer etc. very well",
          "8 of us did this on the last night of summer music. It was so fun! Food and beverages were good and the views are unbeatable! We also did the hike.",
          "Don't be put off by the price - especially if its a sunny day, the views from the top are absolutely stunning - words simply cannot describe them. The event is extremely well organised and the staff are engaging and good humoured. The visitor centre at the topic very informative",
          "Wow, what an incredible ecperience....\"flew\" through the clouds and then the top of the mountains appeared!! Such an amazing view, breathtaking! Buffet lunch best ever!",
          "If you've never ridden a gondola, this one is worth the trip. It doesn't take long to get to the top and you really don't get any kind of weird sensations on the ride. Once off, there is a wooden boardwalk to get you to the weather station. Warning! It's a lot of steps and",
          "This, in my opinion, is a MUST do while in Banff! There is sooooo much to offer here! From spectacular views, to great food, fun shopping, comfortable lounging spots, amazing photo opportunities, etc, etc!",
          "If like us the reason you came to Banff was to see the Rockies, then you absolutely have to take the Gondola trip. We stayed in Banff as part of a trip across Canada and the Gondola was on our list. Very importantly, if you can choose a day when its clear and with little cloud",
          "Nice relaxing ride and views. Take the hike to the weather station. Well maintained and staff is great. We went in early morning. No crowds at that time.",
          "We took this atraction and since we had extra clear visibility, we got an unforgettable . The place ofers very effective logistics.",
          "Yes spend the money and take the gondola to the top. We felt $73 was expensive but would do it again for the once in a life time bucket list to do.",
          "Would definitely recommend this trip. Our driver and guide made the day so enjoyable. Driver's and tour guide Mike and Jenny were great. Scenery was above and beyond beautiful. Bus was comfortable and the pick up and drop was was easy. Would recommend this trip to anyone.",
          "A great experience we had glorious weather which made it spectacular views. A very enjoyable trip, the setup at the top is pleasant.",
          "View is unmatched. Very humbling and breath taking! This is one you absolutely cannot visit Banff without completing.",
          "We got tickets online for the gondola and the restaurant. It wasn't very busy that day so they let us get on the gondola earlier than our allotted time. The restaurant was good, but we are not fans of buffet style restaurants and wished we had not added that to our package. The",
          "Amazing views. Good facilities at the top. Well worth a visit on a gondola to see the snow tipped mountains.",
          "Had a clear day and really good views. Ticketing we learned is variable pricing. We booked in advance and had dates incorrect so they actually refunded and rebooked and turned out to be $25 cheaper! There is only a short 20mjns walk along a boarded platform to a better vantage",
          "It\u2019s a pleasant gondola ride up the mountain. Once on top you are treated to spectacular scenery. There are stairs and walkways that give you other views. We ate at the restaurant and enjoyed the meal. You can spend a half hour, or do a little walking and have something to eat",
          "This popular attraction will have you waiting to queue up, no matter what time your reservation says. However, the staff are friendly and efficient. Beautiful views, nice interpretative center,",
          "Spectacular views, a delicious restaurant, wonderful educational extras, and a piano that you are invited to play while looking out over the most amazing scenery. My husband is an improvisational pianist, and hearing him play while looking out at the mountains was a high point",
          "We went after 5 so rates were a little cheaper. Enjoyed the scenery and the hike out to the old weather station.",
          "This is a must do when visiting Banff. The Gondola ride up Sulphur Mountain was absolutely beautiful despite the clouds. Standing on the observatory deck is like being on the top of the world with every direction more scenic than the next. We ate at the Northern Lights Cafe and",
          "Great view and don\u2019t be scared of the crowds because the line is very organized and you will be up on the mountain before you know it.",
          "Really enjoyed this and it was a lot better than we expected! The gondola ride itself is short compared to rides in Whistler, but the views were still spectacular. There was a lot more to do there than I expected as well, with an exhibition; mini-hike and cafe. We ended up",
          "Once you get out and see the view it feels like a travel greeting card come to life. WHAT A AMAZING VIEW!!! 360 mountain views, friendly squirrels greeting you and a nice place to explore with the kids. The staff were very friendly and is worth the trip. We miss banff.",
          "It isn't a cheap ride and isn't as long as similar gondolas we have ridden in France. However, it's a must do when in Banff simply for the panoramic views of the mountains at the top. I would also recommend the walk out to the old weather station where the views are even better",
          "You will love the vista. Must face downhill when sitting in the gondola for the most spectacular view.",
          "We just could not get enough of the views, once we got to the top of the gondola ride. My husband and our friends said the views at the top of the boardwalk were even more spectacular. The buffet dinner was delicious. The salmon may have been the best I\u2019ve ever had!",
          "If it\u2019s the only thing you can do, this is the activity. The views from the top are amazing. You won\u2019t retreat it. But it\u2019s nit cheap",
          "OMG! What a thrill even though I was scared. This gondola takes you up to about 9,000 feet above the beautiful city of Banff. The view is beyond awesome! Once you arrive on top there is a \u201cboardwalk\u201d that takes you even higher. The elevation makes the walk challenging, but the",
          "A bit expensive but had to be done once. Fantastic views on the way up and down and from especially from the top.",
          "We hiked up the Sulphur Mountain and experienced best view, restaurant, coffee shop, balcony, etc. A must in Banff ...",
          "gondola takes four people at a time and is a smooth fairly quick ride. Information centre at the top is amazing full of interactive information, cafes, gift shop and viewing areas. Views over banff are superb.",
          "Parking can be a problem. Some people take the local bus that roams thru Banff - $2 I believe. Very well orchestrated, from the time you arrive there are several staff to get you in right line and loaded on Gondola. Two good restaurants at the top plus an observation deck and",
          "Great experience! The rides up and down are beautiful. The view from the top is fantastic with views of multiple ranges and the town of Banff. Shopping and refreshments at the top. Chairs and firepits on the viewing platform.",
          "We were the first ones up in the morning so it was crowded at all. Tickets were easy to purchase and then we were on our way. The ride up and back were both smooth and flawless and what terrific views. Once you get up on top there are lots of things to do besides looking at",
          "We went mid-week - no crowds and we were able to ride up earlier than our assigned time. Great views!",
          "One of the highlights of our time in Canada was going up to Sulphur Mountain on the Banff Gondola. At the top there's lots to do and see and the views are stunning. Look out for mountain goats and those cheeky chipmunks. We had lunch & cocktails in the sky bar after doing the",
          "We visited here as a family and timed our trip up later in the day to coincide with the Sunset Festival. It was a little cloudy on the day, but it cleared enough for us to have some amazing views in all directions. The mountains just surround you and really are breathtaking. The",
          "Was the first one in line one morning, so the purchasing of tickets was quick and easy. The ride and the walk to Sanson\u2019s peak on the boardwalk provided for some great views of Banff and great photo opportunities. I believe I heard the boardwalk is about 31 flights of stairs,",
          "So high up, you have fantastic views all around. Places to eat up top, but expensive. Can also walk across to other mountain and lookout, but if you don\u2019t want to, take lift up! There were dall sheep and elk up here. The view is stunningly beautiful.",
          "The beauty of the Rockies on the trip to the Icefields. The fun and so different on the Glaciers and the stunning views and experiences on the Skywalk - don't miss it. Awesome!",
          "The views and ride up are spectacular! I took 44 people up and nobody was disappointed - you just have to see for yourself, don\u2019t miss this one!",
          "This was our first stop after getting off the plane in Calgary and it didn's disappoint. We booked in advance and walked right on to the gondola. Staff was professional and friendly. The walk up top and the view was wonderful. Lunch was just OK, but we were also tired from",
          "Ok, it is expensive so the real questions is - is it worth it. I imagine a number of folks worry about that when deciding to come or not. They also don't have a senior rate which is a shame and the main reason I couldn't go to a 5 on the rating. However rest assured it is",
          "I liked the gondola more than I remembered, haven't been since I was a kid. You can get great pics of the mountains and Banff, see goats, walk around and enjoy a fast ride up and down. I like that you can choose how long you want to be up there and what you want to do. Note to",
          "This was a very scenic ride. However, if you are like me and don\u2019t like heights, I recommend sitting facing the mountain.",
          "We bought the gondola and dinner at the Sky Bistro package. The gondola ride itself is so expensive, I thought it was a good deal to also get dinner. The gondola ride itself was scary to me, very very high up! There is a lot to do once you get to the top. There is a really long",
          "Our visit to Banff - Jasper National Park was amazing. The beauty of the place cannot be described in words, it can only be experienced by being there and in the memories to last forever.we visited last week and it was great to see- Banff gondola, Banff Upper hot springs, Banff",
          "Visited this a few years ago in June and wanted to experience the peace and spectacular views. Unable to park so told to go to Shuttle stop at Fairmont Hotel. Waited almost half an hour in baking heat. Surprised at increase in cost and no senior discount. So crowded",
          "The most amazing view of the Rockies awaits you up top of Sulphur Mountain at around 9.000 feet. You see mountain tops as far as the eye can see. Seating areas with fires to linger and a boardwalk up to the weather station for more views. Don't miss this if you go to Banff.",
          "We drove up to the parking area about 30 minutes before the boarding time, and were turned away by an attendant claiming parking was full. Parked along road side a long way down and walked up, but then saw that nearly a quarter of the lot was empty! The ride itself was smooth,",
          "We enjoyed the gondola ride and observatory walkway. We went at sunset and it was amazing! The local mountain goats even made an appearance. \ud83d\ude0a The views are stunning and the gondolas are very clean and safe. We had a great time!",
          "We had not researched this before booking tickets so were pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The gondola is well organised into time slots to reduce queue times although you are time limited at the top and given a return gondola slot also. That said the time at the top",
          "This place is very pricey but the views totally priceless. Haven\u2019t done for decades but can\u2019t wait to do next summer with our Arkansas friends.",
          "The view is beyond magnificent! From the time you get on the gondola to walking the Sulfur Mountain Boardwalk, no matter what angle or sides you\u2019re on...the experience is nothing short of breathtaking. Highly recommended. I traveled solo and had the gondola all to myself. :)",
          "Absolutely jaw-dropping views from every angle and level, and quite a lot to see/do at the top (we weren't expecting to stay long but we could barely tear ourselves away!). Bit expensive - though we'll remember the views and the feeling, not the price. Was hard to find out info",
          "Ride is better than the views from the top. There is a restaurant and coffee shop at the top though we opted for the Starbucks on the ground level.",
          "This was the highlight of our trip. As far as logistics, parking is very limited here and at the upper hot springs, so unless you are staying at the hotel right beside the gondola I suggest you take one of the very nice Banff town busses that shuttle you to the top unless and",
          "We found the Banff Gondola to be very expensive. It cost $144 for 2 people to take a less then 10 minute ride to the top of Sulfer Mountain. At the top there is a wooden boardwalk to the former site of an environmental stn. We were disconcerted and amazed at the stupidity",
          "The view from the top platform is awesome. We were caught in the heavy rain when we reached the platform, and it was really chilly. Afterwards, there was the beautiful rainbow from one side. Sunshine penetrating the clouds and lightening the grounds is unforgettable.",
          "Do it if you can! Our family of 5 pulled into the parking lot expecting the huge crowds of people, and we weren't disappointed. We drove around the lot a couple of times patiently, and someone pulled out of a spot. ( I will tell you now, if you visit Banff in the summer, be",
          "Loved the ride up/back, as well as the fun observation area and short hike. Amazing views, friendly staff \u2014 and the highest Starbucks in Canada! :)",
          "Well set out helpfull staff awesome views,2 cafes ,interactive activities for children, short movie, I enjooyed my time here",
          "Picked on time very courteous Luke and Mark very knowagble during our 6hr tour of Baniff area very respectfull with giving the wild life space encounted",
          "Clean & efficient gondola. Fantastic views. Nice restaurants & hiking up top. Sky View bistro was great!",
          "Highly recommended. Well worth the cost We were lucky to go on a outstanding weather day. Trips are well timed as to reduce crowding",
          "Parking is tough. You\u2019ll have to lurk and follow people to their car to get a spot. At the top it feels like you\u2019re on top of the world. For the brave, there\u2019s a walkway ....a few hundred yards to the \u2018very top\u2019 for a great photo op. At the main building we followed a tune",
          "Great views of the town of Banff. Easy access to facilitate at top- restaurant, Bistro, gift shops & viewpoints.",
          "We enjoyed our rides in the gondola and the views of Banff from the top of Sulphur Mountain - we were fortunate with good weather although a bit breezy, good to warm up with a hot chocolate. Sadly we didn\u2019t see any wildlife.",
          "We took the gondola trip up on a day where there was limited visibility, by limited visibility I mean you could only see your hand in front of your face. Totally disappointed but there were signs that said limited visibility so I was warned. I spent a lot of money for basically",
          "This was an amazing tour. The gondola ride went quickly as far as waiting in line and the ride was with great views. Once we arrived we were able to get some fantastic pictures. The Sky Bistro Caffe was with a great view and the food was delicious. The price and views were well",
          "We had an excellent day yesterday travelling along the Columbia Icefields highway with the our guide and driver Dom and Andy. Both were extremely friendly, informative and couldn\u2019t do enough to ensure that their passengers had a great time- we would give these guys 5*. The",
          "The line moved quickly and efficiently to the 4 person gondola. The ride up was smooth. But the short hike and gorgeous views of the Bow Valley alone were worth the trip and expense. Large patio with ample seating around gas fires on top and ample tourist services of food,",
          "Beautiful view all along the ride to go to the top and many options on the top to take pictures and walk around. The view is amazing.",
          "We recently took a vacation to the Canadian Rockies and had the opportunity to take a tour with Brewster Sightseeing through the Banff National Park. Breathtaking area with glaciers and mountains all around. I\u2019ve done quite a few sightseeing tours in my day, but what made this",
          "We took the Gondola on an overcast day and the views were still impressive. I can only imagine what the views are with clear blue skies! They also have a very educational displays as to weather and the region that you are observing and a delightful gift shop with refreshments at",
          "We caught the 0900 Gondola up buying tickets that included the breakfast package which were cheaper than just the gondola pass on its own. A nice all you can eat buffet breakfast with good coffee. Amazing views of Banff valley. Well worth the trip.",
          "We booked a joint Gondola and food package in the Northern Lights cafe. The staff were very friendly, especially with my husband who was nervous of the Gondola. The choice in the cafe was much more than I expected and it was excellent quality. It was a bit expensive overall but",
          "Banff Gondola provides Excellent Views of Banff 360*. Its a very steep climb & we were in the clouds when we reached the Top. Must visit @ Banff.",
          "There's no point going here if its clouded over, but if the afternoons are clear, go after 5pm when there is a discounted fare. As the fare is timed, its best to buy in advance from your hotel / accommodation. There is a free shuttle up to the mountain which is also timed, just",
          "Wife and I bought tickets for two at a small discount 2 weeks ahead of time. Probably a mistake as it was sleeting when we got over 6,000 feet. Anyway, sunset. Ride was nice but far too expensive, paid less for a lift ticket and skiing in Tahoe last winyer..jeese. Bear",
          "We went later in the day as to not fight the parking nightmare, arriving about 5 pm as streams of cars were coming back down from both the gondola and hot springs pool. The gondola ride was a great experience. The observation deck as well as the interpretive was well done and",
          "Take the time to ride the gondola and then the short hike up to the lookout areas. Beautiful 360 views. Very wonderful hosts at the bar who were knowledgeable of the area.",
          "I went in the morning up the mountain by gondola. There were not too many people at that time but it has filled up within 2 hours with people. Hence, one should be there either in the morning or later in the evening. The scenery to see Banff from above is an enjoyable",
          "Had a great time trekking up to the glacier with Paige. Great activity for all ages. Make sure to drink the water. Purest I\u2019ve ever tasted.",
          "We really enjoyed our trip up the mountain on the gondola. We were neatly not going to do it cause we had already had a full day and spent heaps of money. But Banff is so scenic this was a must! We could believe how high up we were going. And when we got to the top there were",
          "Stunning scenery at the top, well worth the queues at the bottom. Quite expensive and you can walk up the mountain if you wish. There are times whn it is free one way so maybe worth checking it out.",
          "The actual gondola ride is fine, but the real showstopper is the 360\u00b0 views at the top. You are surrounded by the Rockies with a birdseye view of Banff below. Even on a sunny day in August it was pretty chilly up there but there are several fire pits to warm up by, and the view",
          "I am absolutely TERROFIED of heights but this ride wasn't that bad! It was a quick 7 minute ride up and the same from back down. We went on a windy night which caused a little bit of swaying at the beginning but after that it was a smooth ride up. At the top - the views are",
          "The gondola brings you from the town of Banff to the top of Sulfur Mountain.Amazing views of the lakes, valleys and peaks, do not miss the walk up on the top to the cosmic station , nor enjoy the views from the restaurant.",
          "Although it seemed expensive at first, our Gondola experience was well worth it! The views at the top are absolutely stunning and there is a lot to see. My kids loved the interpretive center up there. We did the boardwalk which was breathtaking, and we saw bighorn sheep around",
          "It is a wait to get up the mountain but very much worth it. Nice trial at the top also. They do a good job getting you to the top with departure time going up and do the gondola.",
          "We were lucky enough to get a parking spot in the main lot, which is normally full! It took some coaxing to get my husband to agree to take this trip...the sheer height of this mountain is a little unnerving! We were able to get a car all to ourselves and as soon as you take",
          "Picked up from our accommodation on time and things stayed like that all day. Andy our driver gave us loads of information along the journey and kept us posted with timescales locations etc. Together with Cam our guide they made us feel important and that they genuinely wanted",
          "We looked to book online. We noticed that it was actually cheaper to book a trip with breakfast in the Northern Lights restaurant. We choose this package. Parking is limited and it gets very busy so we downloaded the roam bus app and paid for a day ticket. We got the bus from",
          "Great gondola ride, company extremely efficient with times assigned, moves like well oiled clock. Great hike at top for old abandoned historic weather station.",
          "Parking is a catastrophe, but there is a shuttle bus which stops all over Banff and takes you directly to the gondola. We booked our ticket online and got a boarding time, so we only had to wait in line for about 5 minutes. The view is breathtaking and you\u2019ll get to see a lot of",
          "We only had a day to visit Banff and were overwhelmed by all the options for hikes. We were traveling with three adults with different hiking interest/ability and three children ages 2, 8&9- the Banff gondola was the perfect solution. We got a beautiful ride far up Sulphur",
          "Have done tours worldwide with a range of guides but this tour with guide Simon has to be one of the best. Friendly, efficient & extremely knowledgeable, clearly spoken & attentive keeping everyone interested. Driver Genesis was friendly & very competent. Altogether a fabulous",
          "I've done this twice now, and the view of Banff is so worth it! The service/wait tends to move quickly.. It's well organized. It's a tad pricey, but it is a tourist attraction so, is what it is. But the view is spectacular. It's worth the view at least once!",
          "The ride up is exhilarating. We spotted a mama goat and her kid from the Gondola. We spent about 2 hours on top. There is an informative display and a cafe in the building at the summit. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed sitting outdoors taking in the views. From the",
          "Must do in Banff. Great surrounding views from the top of the Gondola. Do this when in Banff Gentle ride up the mountain",
          "We decided we wanted to ride up the gondola before even knowing the cost. $69/adult and my toddler was free. There isn\u2019t much to do at the top (gift shop, restaurant, coffee shop, interpretive Center) but the views are OUTSTANDING. You must walk along the boardwalk to the other",
          "The gondola was great. Lines not terribly long, smooth ride, nice facility at the top. There was an outdoor patio with 360 degree views at the top, a small but well-done interpretive exhibit and short film inside, boardwalk and stairs to the actual summit, a couple of coffee",
          "We enjoyed the gondola ride and the venue at the top. Views were spectacular. A little pricey at $70 each. Good board walk. Good restaurant, history display, clean amenities, regular free shuttle service from Main Street in Banff to base of the gondola.",
          "Did our own tour for Gondola Ride ..it was spectacular..great view and sk much to see up..so much memories to cherished...had a fun dun moment with my loved ones..thank u..",
          "The bus ride from Banff to Jasper included stops to walk on the glacier, the Skywalk and the river. Walking the glacier was a unique experience for us. Andrew and Jenny our tour guides were exceptional. A highlight of our trip to the Rockies.",
          "This is a must do in Banff. Very popular and crowed, I would suggest arriving early or late in the day. The view was terrific. Can be cold and windy so dress right. I walked up to the weather station, a lot of steps and higher elevation so take your time. I would have liked",
          "Hard to get through Banff on a Saturday afternoon, but once we arrived, the gondola staff were courteous, knowledgeable, professional, and delightful at the bottom and the top. What a ride!!",
          "Loved riding in the gondola. The kids enjoyed the views as much as we did. If you want to make your way to different viewing decks, there are many sets of stairs. If you are limited, the view from the main building and outdoor deck are amazing as well!!",
          "We were so lucky in May perfect skies; like being close to God! Air is so Fresh and the views outstanding!",
          "Stunning scenery and an amazing ride up to a stunning centre. We bought the Northern Lights dinner package with our ticket. A superb buffet meal looking out over the mountains. Highly recommend",

There are 2 places to eat, there a little museum and theater where you can watch a short video, there\u2019s the",

          "It will give you the opportunity amazing views; the trip is a bit on the expensive side so that is why you need to go there when you can fully enjoy not just the up/down but your time at the top. A clear sunny day regardless of the season will be completely worth; if there are",
          "For an outstanding view of the Bow River valley and the Banff Springs area, this is a must do. Food quality was average but the vistas were simply awesome.",
          "Just a little disappointed in how much money they are charging for this adventure. But the view is simply magnificent when you finally reach the top. The hike to the top of Sulphur Mountain is real easy because it is literally climbing the stairs. Can't get enough of this",
          "it was raining when we first ascended in the gondola but just before our allotted time to come down, the rain stopped and the clouds cleared. A beautiful view was then revealed - it was well worth the wait.",
          "When I began to research our trip to Banff, I read about the crowds of people and lack of parking during the peak summer months. I booked this Brewster tour because they picked us up in Canmore, where we stayed. The whole day couldn't have been better! Our driver, Mike, and",
          "The gondola ride was fun. One tip- you line up to get on the gondola in groups of four- they take your picture that you can buy but if you are a group of two- tell them you want a pic by yourselves and wait for the next gondola. We didn\u2019t want a pic with two people we didn\u2019t",
          "Very cool! Incredibly beautiful! We are headed back to take the entire family. Rode the gondola to the top and watched the sunset and had a very nice dinner. Love this town!",
          "At first when I booked I thought the price was way too high but once we got there and got up to the top that all evaporated - what a view and what an experience. I took my two teenaged granddaughters and they were gobsmacked! I would highly recommend this activity when you go",
          "Went to Banff Gondola this morning around 11am, by this time the car park was totally full and road side was filling up fast! If you can get a shuttle to the gondola that would be a better idea. The trip up was smooth and we had a relatively short wait for transport, once up",
          "The tour price includes transportation, lunch, admission to icefield explorer and the skywalk. Mike was our driver, and Joe was our tour guide. They were both excellent. So much time was saved because we didn\u2019t have to stand in any lines for admission or shuttles. Well worth",
          "The Banff gondola was very cool! Definately worth the money. Go early for shorter lines and a place to park. Make sure its not cloudy when you go. The views were amazing and the ride up and down was cool. The food up on top was good too. Kids are free if you go before 10 am.",
          "A bit expensive but once at the top the views are amazing. Absolutely beautiful. Wish we could have eaten in the restaurant up there. Only complaint is the forced picture taken as you boarded to go back down. Very Disneyish.",

          "Wonderful experience. The staff was super knowledgeable and kind. They noticed I over paid on my tickets and refunded me the over payment right there, before we went on the Gondola (I didn't realize Alberta's get a discounted rate but they do FYI) The bistro was amazing!!",

        "wiki": "Banff is a town within Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. It is located in Alberta's Rockies along the Trans-Canada Highway, approximately 126 km (78 mi) west of Calgary and 58 km (36 mi) east of Lake Louise. At 1,400 to 1,630 m (4,590 to 5,350 ft) above sea level, Banff is the community with the second highest elevation in Alberta, after Lake Louise.\nThe Town of Banff was the first municipality to incorporate within a Canadian national park. The town is a member of the Calgary Regional Partnership.\nBanff is a resort town and one of Canada's most popular tourist destinations. Known for its mountainous surroundings and hot springs, it is a destination for outdoor sports and features extensive hiking, biking, scrambling and skiing destinations within the area. Sunshine Village, Ski Norquay and Lake Louise Ski Resort are the three nearby ski resorts located within the national park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBanff was first settled in the 1880s, after the transcontinental railway was built through the Bow Valley. In 1883, three Canadian Pacific Railway workers stumbled upon a series of natural hot springs on the side of Sulphur Mountain. In 1885, Canada established a federal reserve of 26 km2 (10 sq mi) around the Cave and Basin hot springs, and began promoting the area as an international resort and spa as a way to support the new railway. In 1887, the reserve area was increased to 673 km2 (260 sq mi) and named \"Rocky Mountain Park\". This was the beginning of Canada's National Park system.\nThe area was named Banff in 1884 by George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, recalling his birthplace in Banff, Scotland. The Canadian Pacific built a series of grand hotels along the rail line and advertised the Banff Springs Hotel as an international tourist resort.\nThe Banff townsite was developed near the railway station as a service centre for tourists visiting the park. It was administered by the Government of Canada's national parks system until 1990 when the Town of Banff became the only incorporated municipality within a Canadian national park.\nAn Internment camp was set up at Banff and Castle Mountain in Dominion Park from July 1915 to July 1917. The prisoners of the internment camp were used as free labour to build the infrastructure of the national park.In 1985, the United Nations declared Banff National Park, as one of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, a World Heritage Site. Banff remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Canada.\nOne of the most notable figures of Banff was Norman Luxton, who was known as \"Mr. Banff\". He published the Crag and Canyon newspaper, built the King Edward Hotel and the Lux Theatre, and founded the Sign of the Goat Curio Shop, which led to the development of the Luxton Museum of Plains Indians, now the Buffalo Nations Museum. He and his family helped organize the Banff Indian Days and the Banff Winter Carnival.\nIn 1976, the International Astronomical Union's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) officially adopted the name Banff for a crater on Mars, after the town in Alberta. The crater is at latitude 17.7\u00b0 north and longitude 30.8\u00b0 west. Its diameter is 5 km (3.1 mi).In 1991, Banff hosted the 1991 Winter Deaflympics, the first Deaflympics hosted in Canada, and the only Deaflympics held in Canada since then.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nIt is surrounded by mountains, notably Mount Rundle, Sulphur Mountain, Mount Norquay, and Cascade Mountain. The town is above Bow Falls near the confluence of the Bow River and Spray River. Soils are calcareous and usually imperfectly to poorly drained in their natural state with textures from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBanff experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc) that borders on a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfb).\nWinter temperatures range from an average low of \u221213.3 \u00b0C (8.1 \u00b0F) to an average high of \u22120.2 \u00b0C (31.6 \u00b0F). Summer temperatures in the warmest month are pleasant with an average high of 21.6 \u00b0C (70.9 \u00b0F) and an average low of 7.3 \u00b0C (45.1 \u00b0F). Snow has been recorded in all months of the year. The annual snowfall averages 191.0 cm (75.2 in).\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was 34.8 \u00b0C on August 10, 2018 during a great heat wave.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe population of the Town of Banff according to its 2017 municipal census is 8,875, a change of 5.4% from its 2014 municipal census population of 8,421.In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Banff recorded a population of 7,851 living in 2,543 of its 2,729 total private dwellings, a 3.5% change from its 2011 population of 7,584. With a land area of 4.77 km2 (1.84 sq mi), Banff had a population density of 1,645.9/km2 (4,262.9/sq mi) in 2016.In the 2011 Census, the Town of Banff had a population of 7,584 living in 2,565 of its 2,850 total dwellings, a 13.2% change from its 2006 population of 6,700. With a land area of 4.88 km2 (1.88 sq mi), it had a population density of 1,554.1/km2 (4,025.1/sq mi) in 2011.Parks Canada enforces requirements that individuals must meet in order to reside in the town, in order \"to ensure that a broad supply of housing types are available for those who work and raise families in the community\".\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nThere are a number of popular mountains located immediately adjacent to the townsite which include Mount Rundle (2,949 m or 9,675 ft); Cascade Mountain (2,998 m or 9,836 ft); and Mount Norquay (2,134 m or 7,001 ft). Mount Norquay has a ski slope as well as mountain biking trails on the Stoney Squaw portion. A popular tourist attraction, the Banff Gondola, is available to ascend Sulphur Mountain (2,281 m or 7,484 ft) where a boardwalk (Banff Skywalk) beginning from the upper terminal takes visitors to Sanson Peak. Sulphur Mountain is also the location of one of Banff's most popular attractions, the Banff Upper Hot Springs.\nLake Minnewanka located six minutes north of the townsite is a very popular day use area with a variety of activities. Mountain biking, hiking and fishing are all activities allowed in this part of the park. A very popular Lake Cruise, motor boat rentals and a small food concession are available at the marina.\nTunnel Mountain (formerly known as Sleeping Buffalo Mountain) (1,690 m or 5,545 ft) is situated within the townsite and is very popular for quick hikes; one can reach the summit in less than half an hour. It was named Tunnel Mountain because surveyors initially wanted to make a tunnel for the Canadian Pacific Railway right through the mountain, instead of following the Bow River Valley. Located on the side of Tunnel Mountain is the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, which hosts a number of events including outdoor concerts, dance, opera and theatre.\nBanff is home to the well-known Banff World Television Festival, Banff Mountain Film Festival, Rocky Mountain Music Festival and Bike Fest. The city is also the starting point of the 4,417 km (2,745 mi) Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, which terminates at Antelope Wells, New Mexico in the United States.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nBanff and nearby Canmore played host to the 2014 Alberta Winter Games.\nBanff also hosted the 1991 Winter Deaflympics.\nFor a number of years there has been an annual long-distance relay run between Banff and Jasper, Alberta (formerly known as the Jasper to Banff Relay).\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nIn June 2008, the Banff council launched a local bus system called Roam, with three routes connecting the town, Tunnel Mountain, the Banff Springs Hotel, and the Banff Gondola. The service is operated using four hybrid Nova buses, each decorated with scenes from the National Park. There are three separate routes:\n\u2022 Route 1: which goes to Sulphur Mountain\n\u2022 Route 2: which goes to Tunnel Mountain\n\u2022 Route 3: which goes from Banff, to nearby Canmore. \nMany bus stops along the routes have screens which tell exactly how many minutes before the next two buses arrive. In December 2012, the bus system was expanded to include the Route 3 hourly service between Banff and Canmore.Via Rail's long-distance trains no longer serve Banff, but the Banff railway station remains in use by the Rocky Mountaineer and Royal Canadian Pacific tour trains.\nThe nearest airport to Banff with major service is the Calgary International Airport in Calgary.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nAcute health care is provided at the Banff \u2013 Mineral Springs Hospital.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nKaren Percy, double-bronze medal skier at the 1988 Winter Olympics\nJ.

          "You can ride the Gondola up Sulphur mountain or pay less for a chairlift at Norquay Ski Area. I enjoyed the views provided and was able to see a black bear (from above) as well as a golden eagle and a family of big horn sheep. There are cafes at both the top and bottom of the",
          "This was one of the best things we did in Banff. Our guide Eli was knowledgeable and very friendly, showed genuine interest in how each of us were doing on the climb and guided us very well through the experience. I had no prior climbing experience but I had so much fun climbing",
          "Such an amazing trip! Our first day was rained out and we rescheduled for free for the following day and I am so glad we did! Our guide Sarah was great and it was quite the adventure. Highly recommend! People with fears of height need not apply, pretty accommodating for anyone",
          "Absolutley awesome day!! Our guide Jesse (AJ) was very knowledgeable and helpful. This was a great climbing experience for us novices. I did this trek with 2 of my daughters and had trouble with the \"height-thing\" and became more nervous with the ascent so decided with AJ it'd",
          "Had an excellent day with my daughters! Jesse(AJ) was an awesome guide with lots of fun facts even for us locals! A super fun thing to do together!",
          "Took the chairlift up to the top as an alternative to the Banff Gondola. Views were sensational. Much cheaper/more affordable than the Banff Gondola. Saw Elk and big horn sheep. Plenty of these animals on the drive up to the chairlift. Great alternative to the Banff Gondola.",
          "I booked the Via Feratta explorer route as a part of my Banff trip and it was my favorite activity for the entire trip. I was a little nervous about the activity, but it was easy, safe, and super exciting! Not to mention the view from the top was gorgeous and well worth the",

          "Our guide was Ben and he is friendly, chill, very informative and amazing all-around guide. He is very clear and made the experience even better! We did the 6 hour Via Ferrata Summit Tour and I highly recommend this over the other tours if you want the best of the best views",
          "This trip was well organized and it was great to have all gear included in the price. We even rented sturdier shoes within the cost of the trip. Our guide, Jesse, was an excellent guide- we didn't feel rushed and felt well informed at every corner. This was a completely new",
          "We recently did the 6 hour Via Ferrata Summit Tour and had the best experience ever! The day was extremely well organized, Kim the guide was fantastic, lunch and post-climb food were delicious and the weather allowed for the full experience right to the top! We felt challenged",

          "Our family to Banff and Via Ferrata was one of the hi lights of our trip! We did the 3 hour explorer,,,just perfect for us as some family member first time on Via Ferrata. We all had a great time and staff members were very informative and helpful. Will definitely do again",
          "They were very helpful and knowledgeable. The guide stayed with me and helped me. It was super fun. I was pleasantly surprised when they offered to let people use their good climbing boots and a wind jacket for no extra cost. They also sent some photos to my email for no charge.",

          "We had never rock climbed before, and this was rock climbing. Not a scenic hike on a mountain. Coming from the flat prairies it was a little unnerving. My wife was terrified with the rock face crossing, but we are glad we did it. The guide was fantastic. Now we had 2 x 12 year",
          "Recommended by someone when purchasing tickets, great view overlooking Banff/ the mountains. Doesn't take a long time but also got to see some wildlife which was neat. Save yourself some money and you won't be disappointed!",
          "My girlfriend and I had an amazing time. Kim was the best guide and made us feel safe and encouraged us every second of the way. It was one of the coolest things We\u2019ve ever done. Kim took many great pictures, we were fed lunch, and had a beer and cheese plate after we were",
          "I was a little worried about choosing the longest Via Ferrata route but thought I'd regret it if I didn't do the whole thing. It was the right choice! Our guide, Logan, made sure the whole group moved together and there were plenty of stops for rests and water. We were given a",

          "So glad we did this! I have a major fear of heights but our guide, Eli, was the best at keeping me calm during the moments with more exposure. We were trained on our equipment and trekked up the mountain using the iron foot and hand holds while being tethered to the cable with",
          "We had a fun 4 hours in the mountains. Combination of hiking and the climbing activity. The guide was very good and very safe. I would recommend it.",
          "The whole experience was extremely professional. They even provide a free shuttle so we I didn't have to drive, huge bonus!! We choose to do the Summiteer route. Our guide, Ben, was awesome! Made us feel comfortable and safe the whole time. They used walkie talkies to keep in",
          "So much fun, I totally recommend it! Our guide was Eli; he was so friendly. He made everyone comfortable, knew a ton about the area. He got everyone comfortable and removed any nerves/fears that anyone in the group had. The equipment was in great condition, I felt totally safe",
          "We did both the gondola ride and the Norquay lift ride and definitely preferred Norquay. The views of Banff are better, you're closer to the surrounding mountains and the view of the western Bow valley is incredible. Riding up on an open ski lift was fun too. Granted, if you",
          "The weather was a little chilly (with some snow in June) but we had a blast regardless. The guide was awesome and we got some wonderful views and did some great climbing! It was worth the splurge to do something unique.",

          "Did not know what to expect when we signed up for this adventure. It was everything and more. Staff were knowledgeable and helpful. Katsu, our guide , was awesome, helpful, encouraging and funny! The views are absolutely remarkable. Some parts of the climb looked intimidating",
          "We tried our first Via Ferrata at Mt. Norquay. The weather was not great but Shep, our guide, was awesome. We started by getting our gear and then a chairlift ride up the mountain. Next we did a skills test and practiced clipping into the cables. We then headed up the mountain",
          "All staff members were very nice and helpful although the chairlift was broken and the weather was not on our side. Eventually we got on the mountain and it was spectacular. Worth the money and waiting. The ridgewalker is a fun hike and the views are awesome. Highly recommend it!",
          "This a great way to experience and see the Rockie Mountains and Banff. The views all along the climb were spectacular. we had great weather so the climb felt quite easy to do, but we were safely tied to the via ferrata which will help when looking down the mountain. our guide",
          "We had the most amazing experience with the wonderful Katsu as our guide. We did the Ridgewalk experience which was quite challenging in places but we were exhilarated when we finished. Views fantastic and well worth doing if in Banff.",
          "Very well organized - our guide Katsu was extremely professional and encouraging. The via ferrata is by far one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences we've ever had. Terrifying and exhilerating at the same time - you are responsible for your own safety but the",
          "The chairlift experience offers a great view of the surrounding area. Be aware you cannot hike down as there and trails, but they do offer rock climbing near the the chairlift station at the top. Restaurant staff at the top were very friendly, you also have to try their maple",
          "We really really really enjoyed this unique mountain experience in Banff. We loved the many hikes we took, yet this was distinct in its physicality and challenge. Liam our guide was fantastic: knowledgeable, friendly, supportive, and fun. I have a mild fear of heights but",
          "This was our third climb on the Via Ferrata. The service, equipment, staff and guides couldn't have been better. If only the same could have been said for the weather! On previous years the concern was all about water and sunscreen. On our climb this July we had snow. Still, a",
          "As we left Banff, we thought we go for a quick drive up the hill to see Mt Norquay ski fields. On the way up we saw a group of sheep and hoped they would still be there when we came back down. There is a lot of carparks available at the base station of Mt Norquay which was all",
          "We stopped at the viewpoint only as it we are not skiers and it wasn\u2019t the right season. Great place to view Banff and some of the surrounding mountains. There is also some wildlife to see including goats and lots of rodent dudes.",

          "Took my 9 year old snowboarding and tubing. We both had a great time, the hill has lots of different runs for every ability level. Went up the big lift to the top of the world, fantastic views up there. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 was that the staff were pretty",

          "Although Norquay is not as good as Sunshine or Lake Louise, it is close to town. I did not like that they eliminated the hourly rates and instead offer a last two hour rate of $56 and last one hour rate of $36. Compare that to a half day at Sunshine for $96 for 4 hours and I",
          "We decided to have an afternoon of snow tubing during or Christmas holiday. This was the only experience we had at this ski field location. It was only a short trip from Banff so it was a perfect activity to fill in the day. They had numerous lanes with a choice of going down",

          "We didn\u2019t have chains on our tires (there is a warning sign), but it was a relatively easy and an enjoyable drive on the snow covered road through pine trees up to Norquay. On the many switchbacks we caught glimpses of a beautiful view overlooking of Banff. The parking at",
          "It was a really fun experience. The tubing was fun, although there is a minimum height ( so you should check before going). My little one enjoyed the playground right next to the tubing. Food options are good and staff are friendly.",
          "My husband and I scheduled our first snowboarding lesson with the snow school at Norquay. We had never been snowboarding nor skiing so the experience was brand new. Our instructor, Lucas, was able to teach us the basics and then when he felt we could try and we felt comfortable",
          "The drive up was amazing: so many great views also was 19ft RV friendly for the winter. Not a far drive from Banff. Good prices for day pass and bar/ restaurant. As for snowboarding. Would not reccommend for a beginner because of its inclination. Although, norquay is an",
          "As a first time snowboarder I booked a lesson at mt Norquay as it was the cheapest option of the 3 ski resorts and the closest to Banff. The staff are very helpful. Will was my instructor and was very patient and helpful. This ski resort is great for beginners and isn\u2019t as cold",
          "Great time on the hill! Staff are friendly, kids had a blast! We paid extra for the sight seeing, was a bit of a waste of cash to be honest. Beautiful view but the bistro wasn't open and there wasn't anything to do. View was amazing but young kids aren't really into beautiful",
          "We took a day off from skiing and did some snowshoeing at Mt. Norquay. We had our own equipment and took the Upper Stoney Squaw Loop. It is a gorgeous trail with great views. I would call the trail moderate -- some uphills and downhills. You will get your heart pumping and",
          "We decided to take our 5 year old snow tubing here while in the Canmore and it was such a fun experience. The staff are great, and very helpful, fun atmosphere, lots of tube runs and the wait wasn't long at all. The view is amazing. Our only complaint was while walking into the",
          "Paid full price only to discover it\u2019s nowhere near as good as the other hills. Kinda like baby hills compared to surrounding area. Asked if I could upgrade my ticket to big 3 ticket to go to Sunshine. Upgrade, meaning pay more money, and they wouldn\u2019t let me. 2/5 cause it\u2019s",
          "My friend and I went to the snow tubing at Mt. Norquay, the overall experience was breathtaking. The staff that was handling the tubing were very friendly and helpful. As I did the tubing for almost 15 times within a span of 2 hours, most of the staff recognized me over and over",
          "Who knew that tubing could be so much fun. Mt Norquay is only a 10 minute drive via free shuttle bus from Banff. The 10 lane tube park was great fun and you don't have to walk up the hill. They have a stand on elevator that takes you to the top.",
          "An excellent Tube park for families. They had 6 runs open when we were there. The overall setup of the hill is well designed to accommodate lots of people. Even at its peak it really only took 10 minutes to go from the bottom of the hill to the top. Well staffed and organized.",
          "Tubing at Norquay is a MUST if you are not a skier or snowboarder. Very well organised, busy enough to have an atmosphere but not to slow down rides on your tube. The greatest fun you can have with your clothes on !!!",
          "Whether you're an advanced skier or this is your first experience on skis you will find this a beautiful place to be outdoors! Bring a suit and head to the Hotsprings in Banff. Total lift capacity: 7,000 people per hour Skiable Terrain 60 runs",
          "For someone who does not like speed, the tubing here was terrific. It is so safe going down the tubing running, no worry about bumping into other tubers. Great family fun for all ages. Busy in the afternoon, after skiers finish the hills in the morning. Better waiting times",

Lift passes and ski hire can be done here and it is straight forward.......but a bit antiquated \ud83d\ude33The owners need to visit Europe\u2019s ski resorts how to use lift passes etc..,.",
          "We had a fantastic day at Mt Norquay. Upon arrival in the free bus from Banff, we decided to try out the tube run. So much fun. The whole family can join up together for a run down the mountain. The staff in this area keep you entertained. They made sure we had a great time",
          "We didn't opt for riding the gondola to the top, but the area at the end of the road was very pretty. Even more so the drive up the twisting turning road and the views down onto Banff were beautiful. We came across a herd of big horn sheep on the way back down that just made",
          "The drive up the mountain has many hairpin turns but we were rewarded with a stunning view and some mountain goats right near the car park of the red chairs. You can continue up the road to the ski hill where there is a restaurant and the chairlift. It really is spectacular.",
          "Wonderful views and a much less crowded and cheaper prion than the Gondola in Banff. Saw lots of wildlife on the way up to the ski hill and while at the ski hill. Scenic lookout on the way up from the highway also worth a stop.",
          "We kept hearing how great the Banff Gondola was. The day we were planning on taking it up the mountain, we had breakfast at my hotel (Delta Banff Royal Canadian- Great see review). One of the servers told us that when her family comes to town she goes to Norquay ski resort and",
          "My heart has belonged to Banff for all of my 68 years! So many experiences but I almost never visit without a trip up to the 7th turn on the way up to Norquay. This magical seven hairpin road snakes its way up the south leg of Mount Norquay and it is on the seventh hairpin that",
          "Norquay knows how to take care of tourists and locals year round! I have skied at Norquay for 9 years and adventured there during the summer since they opened the sightseeing chairlift. Today's experience was incredible; we rose above the clouds and got to view the inversion",
          "Well worth it! Fantastic views from the top and the chance to see some wildlife if you're lucky - we saw elk. Great restaurant on top with lovely staff.",
          "We tried to get there early 10-11 am to try to spot wildlife and saw mother bear and 2 cubs, 3 deer and big horn sheep. Recommended to come out early to catch wildlife animals.",
          "Stop at the final switch back as you head up the mountain. Amazing views over Banff and a grassy meadow to sit on and relax. Good for wildlife spotting on the way up too. Especially in the morning and evening.",
          "We visited for a wedding - wonderful venue, beautiful scenery and great food. We saw a herd of goats up the hill from the wedding venue! Next day we returned and took the chairlift to the top - spectacular views! Also a fun casual cafe with good food. Worth a visit!",
          "We were undecided on whether to do this or the gondola ride so we did both - we both agreed this was one of our highlights of our trip. It was so lovely and peaceful at the top - we sat for ages just admiring the spectacular views. When we were ready for a drink we were welcomed",
          "Once you get over the first 5 minutes of panic from the height and clinging to the side of a cliff, the experience is exhilarating. It's very safe; I never felt in danger of falling. Our guide, Katsu, was the best! He was patient with the nervous people and provided extra",
          "We visited over the summer. It was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Banff and the popular lakes. We went up on the ski chair, no lines and prompt service. View was great! I would say it was a little pricey ($70 for two).",
          "We visited Mt. Norquay in June because of the chairlift ride to the top and loved every minute of it. I would venture to say it rivals the Sulphur Mountain ride and experience. It is cheaper than Sulphur with much less people, which was a huge plus. It offers incredible aerial",
          "Just a short ride out of town up a hill with lots of switchbacks, you arrive at a stone wall with parking and an opening onto a hillside meadow that has gorgeous views of Banff, the surrounding mountains, the Vermillion Lakes and local landmarks. We have never gone up this hill",
          "It\u2019s a short drive up a hairpinned road to the lookout point. There\u2019s a good view across Banff and the mountains beyond. Nothing fantastic but worth the brief detour if you\u2019re passing.",
          "Our family had a great time skiing at Norquay. The slopes were well maintained and the staff were friendly. We to the top of the hill and the map had said that there were blue runs, but the runs were closed. in our group we had some younger skiers and they were quiet terrified.",
          "Mom and Daughter day on the hill. Great weather and conditions. The resort is not overly big but a great place to learn to ski. There is black diamond hills that are separate from the rest. Very close to downtown Banff but road up very crazy windy. You can get good ticket deals",
          "We skied here one day after skiing 2 days at Banff Sunshine. Yes, it is small by comparison, but it was actually perfect for this midwestern family. Our 3 kids (13, 11, 8) loved it. We also went tubing here another day, which was a lot of fun, although more tiring than I",
          "I have skied a few times here and it's always a pleasure. It's small and you can do it all in a day, but the runs are nice, well maintained and this place is usually a little less crowded than other places. Prices here are also lower than at Sunshine and Louise. The only",
          "One of the upsides to a much snowier winter than usual is the excellent spring skiing that comes with a solid March-May season. This year Mt. Norquay has surpassed its often good-to-very good spring conditions with some of the best downhill spring snow in memory. I do need to",
          "We decided to spend our last full day in Banff on Mt Norquay after our waiter the night before suggested it. Neither of us can ski being from warmer climates in Aus. The tickets we got were for a full day snow tubing and a ride up to the restaurant at top for some spectacular",
          "Friendly and helpful staff, from the restaurant to chair lifts and snow tubing! It was not busy when we went there on a Saturday, where the weather (10 cm of snow, -18C) in Calgary was crazy in April. Then we landed Mt. Norquay, it was a beautiful 0-degree temperature, a lot of",

          "We picked up a groupon deal for tubing at Mt Norquay. Although we had been up to Sunshine and Louise on several occasions, we have not been up to Mt Norquay. The road in was beautiful. The tube park was busy, but we did not have to wait for a tube at any time. The runs are",
          "The smaller of the mountains Norquay is often quieter than the sister mountains of sunshine and lake Louise but it has plenty to challenge you with more difficult but shorter runs you certainly feel the burn! It is also the cheapest and we often take advantage of the big drop",
          "We came here for the sightseeing chairlift and tubing. The views from the top of the chairlift are spectacular! It was a relatively short trip up and back. We loved the tubing! However, it was definitely a lot faster than we expected it to be! We appreciated the moving walkway",
          "Came here mid week in March an no one here. Rental staff was great, lift operators were great, we are novice so some style of lifts we had no seen before.",
          "I spent the day at Norquay with my wife on a recent trip to Banff. This was our third time in Banff and while we had intended to ski there in the past, we had never got round to it. On this occasion we did and what a good day it was. It was a Sunday but you would never have",
          "We were so blessed to the bluest sky, beautiful day, well groomed runs and the conveyer moving us back to the top of the tube park. I am a grand mother and we went with three grand children and a adult son. One of my grandsons is in a wheel chair and he was able to participate",
          "We came here to try out snowshoeing. We rented our snowshoes in town and decided to try them out on the Norquay trails. The trail map from the ticket counter did not match the trail map online for snowshoeing, so we were a little confused. We asked a ski school instructor where",
          "We are from Florida and have never skied. We went to Mt. Norquay for the snow tubing and it was great fun. Maybe no big deal for experienced snow sports people but for us it was tremendously exciting. It was especially enjoyable because the weather was great and the lines",
          "Went to Norquay last week, first time in over ten year... never again! After two hours we were bored. Snow nowhere near as good as Sunshine Village. Very hard packed, and disappointed that two runs were closed for race training. Also, we wanted to go up to the Continental Bistro",
          "We went skiing with a few newer skiers and although it was a beautiful mountain there was only a few runs they could do as a lot of them were pretty steep! But would highly recommend for intermediate skiers! The views are incredible and there is tubing to which was awesome.",
          "Went with a group of 5 and decided to go tubing. The ticket staff were great but thats where it ends. The girls on the hill were to busy fixing their makeup and building a tube house. We watch them yell at some customers who miss understood the signs which alot of people did.",
          "The skiing is great! The hill is well organized. All the runs were open and the lifts. We did the all inclusive pass and rented gear. The rental place was helpful. The tubing is super fun! Definitely recommend doing that. Also rode the Norquay lift to the very top and saw the",
          "Ok so I'm a begginer skier and by that I mean this was my second time skiing. I read the review saying it was great for beginner. I have to disagree. Once you get out of the chair lift it's steep and icy! Scary for a begginer. Ive fallen many time just trying to get pass that",
          "I learned to ski here a million years ago. The hill of course has changed but is still a great small local hill. The addition of the tube area just adds variety for non skiers.",
          "We dedicated a trip to Norquay for the snow tubing. We arrived early on a Friday just after the tube runs opened. A quick trip inside to get passes and we were on our way. Lineups were almost non existent. We went on run after run with the only wait being a minute or two for",
          "Visited on toonie day! Fantastic the ski hill provides this and supports a charity. Big kudos to management who gives back to Alberta residents and gives back to the community. I knew it was going to be busy and there would be lines. Staff was friendly and directed people very",
          "The temps were cold and the runs were more icy than some in our group would have preferred. However what we could agree on was the value for the cost (which was substantially less than nearby Sunshine) and the variety of runs. The way the hill is set up is that there are",
          "Enjoyed this as a pipe opener for the trip. Only 1 lift for the black diamond runs other lifts served a series of runs through the trees. The Lodge was a good 'pit stop' point. It is well served by the free shuttle from Banff. Also other things for children with designated",
          "We are novice skiers and thoroughly enjoyed our day at the ski fields. Facilities are good and easily accessed. The toboggan runs are a real bonus and a lot of fun. Full day pass including toboggan $94, ski pass only - $70. Short drive from Banff.",
          "We were sceptical at first on how the tubing would go because of how cold it was on New Year\u2019s Eve but surprisingly minus 20 something didn\u2019t put a damper on the tubing at all! It was a great time and great people working there.",
          "Enjoyed the experience. My kids went alone , had a wrist fracture. First aid Patrol was good but arrived late. wasted whole day at the hospital . but other kids enjoyed. Just make sure u around to take care of ur kids esp teens . Enjoyed the runs n rides. tubbing is gun too esp",
          "Having lived and worked in Banff and at Norquay 25 years ago we took a trip down memory lane! Runs were a lot steeper than we remembered and in some instances the black runs weren\u2019t that much different from a blue! Good service on lifts and in cafe.",
          "Me and my wife had SO much fun tubing on my birthday, Paid about 30 each for an all day pass. It really got the heart pounding and was such a fun day. We got to go on a few runs together as well holding each others tubes.",
          "There's the coolest windy, hairpin-riddgles road that snakes up Mt Norquay, and it mainly serves Banff first ski hill. But there are other features up there that even the non-skier will love. There are two major trailhead that are served by the road and parking area, but just a",
          "My wife and I bought the \u201cFirst Time Skier\u201d package that included rental, magic carpet and instructor. Brad Smith, our instructor was so good that at the end of our day we were easily stopping and doing parallel turns!! He was very attentive to details on how to correct mistakes",
          "In all of our various tours in and around Banff, I found this place to be off the beaten path, yet its so close to the townsite of Banff. The trip up the hill is twisty and turny and has a great spot to pull over and get some great views of the town and surrounding area. Once",
          "We drove up the mountain to get to the chairlift but as we arrived it was closed due to unforeseen circumstances till the end of the season (what season?). We ended up half way the mountain on a open clearing from which we could see Banff and surroundings clearly. The weather",

          "If you are looking for a change from the expensive gondola costs, visit Mt. Norquay. It is a short 5 minute drive from downtown Banff, easily accessible from the highway. The drive up is a driver's paradise, great winding roads. We saw a family of mountain goats on our way up.",

          "Good experience. Reasonably priced compared to other activities we tried. Good view (was a bit smokey due to the forest fires but nothing to be done about that). Views are not as impressive as the Sulphur mountain but the bistro is quaint, offers decent food and has a great",
          "Our reservation had a minor hiccup. Fault was completely ours. But the staffmembers, affectionately known as \"the Trifecta\", made sure we were able to climb Mt Norquay. They send us on our way with K, our guide. K did an amazing job telling is all we needed to know to climb and",
          "We looked at the chairlift, and the prices, and felt like stretching our legs instead. The staff were very helpful with advice, although one british chap almost scared us into staying in our RV with tales of multiple 8' grizzlies round every corner. His colleagues were more",
          "We visited as a family, 2 people did the Via Ferrata and loved it. Incredibly good staff. The rest of us went for the chairlift ride and hot chocolate with a view to die for at the top. Perfect afternoon made all the better for the friendliness of the staff, even the shuttle",
          "The Mt Norquay chairlift is not as well known as the Banff and Lake Louise gondolas which means that it is cheaper and less busy. On the way up to the lift we saw big horn sheep and a black bear on the side of the road! Having already been on the Lake Louise gondola, the views",
          "As there was a noticeable extent of smoke (caused by the forest fire in Kootenay National Park), I drove up to the Mt. Norquay instead of taking the Banff gondola, it ended up to be a wise decision. It offered a splendid view.",
          "We visited Norquay on the last day of our one week trip to Banff and were very disappointed with the view. Having ridden the lifts at Sunshine and Lake Louise, this was not worth the 30 dls. While the staff is very friendly and the view is ok, in comparison to the other resorts",
          "This wasn't my first visit to Banff but I'd never heard about the Mt Norquay Chairlift until a friend told me about it. It's a bit more basic than the Banff Gondola when you get up to the top, just the one viewpoint and the restaurant (unless you want to do one of the",
          "An amazing open air chairlift up to the top. The view is stunning and the Lodge has the yummiest food. Highly recommend the cheese board for two. Sooo yummy and not horrendous prices. Fabulous value for money all round.",
          "Magnificent view. Everybody was super nice and very friendly. This was the highlight of our trip thus far. Everything is beautiful but this showed how majestic the area is. A whole lot less busy than the gondola ride.",
          "It was a short drive from our hotel in Canmore (less than 20min). The road up to the parking lot is a bit narrow so please watch your speed as you navigate the many corkscrew turns. We decided to take the two-person chairlift up to the top. Once you reach the top the endless",
          "We booked the Ridgewalker Via Ferrata and it did not disappoint. The hike was challenging but so worth it, our guide was amazing, friendly, and helpful. Would totally recommend to someone who wants to get some hiking in!",
          "We did not go the whole way to the ski area, as we just wanted to stop at the scenic viewpoint overlooking Banff. And what a scenic view we had! So stunning that we decided to get out our picnic and eat on the hillside \ud83d\ude00 Little gophers all around \ud83d\ude00 Also Parks Canada have",
          "We hiked the (stopping to enjoy the views at the top). Stoney Squaw trail in about 2 hours. Its mostly shaded and mostly uphill, but there is enough variation up and down that it was not too exhausting. The trail for the first 2/3 is mostly covered with roots and so you have to",
          "Did the Via Ferrata climb and it was amazing! Very fun and a safe way to climb up the mountains. Our guide Jeff, was great!",

          "The drive up the mountain was a site to see switchbacks meeting bighorns sheep along the way. A gorgeous rest stop to take scenic pictures.",
          "By taking the Chairlift you will get the best view of this region Much better than the Gondola ride and 1/2 the price And if you get a chance and speak to the ranger you will get a great feel for the area and the amazing things The Y2Y conservation Project is doing to improve",
          "We drove up Norquay Road early one morning and enjoyed the amazing views. We were alone at each stopping point, and we chuckled at how much of a \"hidden gem\" this must be. The ride up Mt. Norquay is definitely worthwhile.",
          "Since we visited in the late spring, the ski resort was closed but the short drive up still offered a beautiful view of the town of Banff and its surroundings. If you are not interested in riding the Banff gondola, this provides a great alternative with similar views. Of",

          "We have been skiing for half a day. Slopes are short but steep. Much more difficult than the other ski areas. Mt norquay is only 15 minutes ride from Banff. Do not forgett to do the snow tubing. It is so much fun! We did it for 2hours. We also took the little chairlift to a",
          "You can take the short drive up the mountain, there is a lookout at the top with beautiful views, worth the 15 min drive up. we saw many goats and cyclists on/in the road, so drive slowly. when you're up at the lookout, look over the ledge, you can walk down and take",
          "This is a must if you are ever in the area. We arrived on opening time and stayed until 2pm and had plenty of rides on the lanes. The staff were all attentive and made sure the area was safe before you got into your rubber ring. This activity is great for young and old alike.",
          "Norquay is a great hill, even when the North American is closed. By 11, the sun was up and the snow was soft. Lots of good skiing even at the end of the season, no line ups, great food, beautiful chalet.",
          "Been going to Banff for twenty years and never got around to skiing Norquay until this year. The mountain spreads out in an unusual manner. The most challenging runs are located on the left side looking up the mountain. The middle is mostly for beginners. The far left has what",

          "For the past three years we have visited the tube park but, never again. We went there on March 25, 2017 and , for some reason, they have changed the way they do the runs so, there were no more than two runs with sliders on them at any one time (despite the fact that all but",
          "This is really close to Banff and is a great little resort. I'm not an accomplished skier but the runs were manageable for me. The views over Banff are great and it was a good day out. Thanks to Jared from the ski school for his patience and great advice which helped me regain",
          "Mt Norquay is very close to Banff compared to the bigger mountains around the area. I actually really enjoyed this hill. It was not busy when I went and I was able to learn some more snowboarding skills. The runs are not super long and some of the terrain can be challenging.",
          "I took my kids skiing here. Not much can be helped with ice and weather conditions. The beginner area is for those that have never skied before. But the one area that we could ski was to steep for my daughter whom has skied a few times (15) before. The staff working on the",
          "We brought our girls here for their 3rd time on skis and they had a fantastic time. Their confidence grew on the bunny hill with the fantastic magic carpet which is so easy to use, and the chairlifts to green runs were all very easy for them to use. For more advanced skiers,",
          "As the smaller resort in the Big 3 it would be too easy to skip it in favour of either Sunshine or Lake Louise... but really don't! On a clear day this place gives you the best view of Banff and the surrounding area. It has some great runs for honing your technique and it's well",

          "For someone who has never done a chairlift before, I have to admit that the first sight of the little chairs in the distance slowly make their way up the very steep mountain side was more than a little daunting! I think I almost even bottled it at one point as we approached,",
          "A couple that my friend and I met the day before recommended Mt. Norquay for wildlife viewing (mountain sheep). We didn't find any but we did find great spot to have lunch and rest! We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in the \"RED CHAIRS\" and soaking in an incredible view of this",
          "What a view. It really put into perspective how high up we were when we saw a helicopter flying around below us. The value for money was excellent. We were given 2 for 1 vouchers by the lovely staff at tunnel mountain resort which meant it cost us $40 for our family of 4. Much",
          "Our helpful hotel concierge suggested the Mt Norquay chairlift instead of the new Gondola. There is a free shuttle to the chairlift, and a caf\u00e9 at the bottom and the top of the lift. The views from the top are magnificent, and the caf\u00e9 was fantastic, with a roaring open fire.",
          "We were recommended to go by our concierge who gave us a 2 for 1 voucher and it was well worth it. Chair lift was fun riding over treetops and the view from the top was breathtaking. Great views from the cafe too Would recommend this as a must do",
          "Take the chairlift up Mt Norquay up to the Cliff Restaurant at the 6857 ft point of the mountain. The views are stunning. It cost us $20 per person. It was well worth it. We'll definitely return in the future.",
          "Let me first tell you that I am terrified of heights, but in spite of my tears and pleas, my travel companion insisted that I go up the ski lift at Mt Norquay with him. He promised I would be happy that I did, and he was absolutely right. Note - the chairs are open with a bar",
          "You can choose to take the gondola up for great vistas or you can hike up. It's a tough climb but on the way you find so many great vistas that you'd miss if you took the gondola up. The view to Banff and the Bow river from the vista point below the gondola station is",
          "We were advised to try the norquay lift which is a 5 minute drive outside of Banff rather than queuing for an hour for the gondola. The lift was open so a little more exciting, it was a fraction of the price and we got to walk straight on. Only negative is that you can't walk",
          "My wife and I were originally going to ride the gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain but the long wait when we arrived (1 hour 20 minutes) and the current \u201climited facilities\u201d at the upper gondola terminal (a snack bar and porta-potties) discouraged us. That was actually",

          "Our hotel reception staff recommended the Mount Norquay chair lift over the Banff Gondola, and I'm pleased we listened. No queues and only a few other people around. The views from the top are stunning, and there's a restaurant for lunch too. Half the price of the Banff Gondola",
          "We opted to visit this lift instead of the popular Banff Gondola by Mt Sulphur. This lift is just as close to the village & is half the cost. We encountered several groups of Bighorn Sheep both driving up & back down the mountain. Very welcoming & helpful staff here, as we saw",
          "At just $20, this ride up the mountain offered great views of the Rocky Mts & Banff National Park. It is a T-bar chair lift, not a gondola so be prepared with correct footwear and the winds can be cool too. There is a very nice restaurant at the top but be prepared to wait for",

          "The concierges and some of the other locals at the Fairmont Banff Springs recommended the Norquay Chairlift over the Banff Gondola. It is half the price (even less with 2 for 1 coupons) and a lot less of a wait but with similar views. Of course if chairlifts make you nervous,",

          "We came by car to the ski lift station and we found that this place offer ski lift ride even in summer for a half price of Banff Gondola. The view from the upper station is nice, and there is also a nice restaurant for lunch or snack. Very pleasant morning in Mt.Norquay",
          "My spouse and I did the 4 hour Ridgewalker Via Ferrata at Mount Norquay, Banff today and it exceeded our expectations! Our experienced guide, Chris, was patient, pleasant and safe as he led us up the rock face. The equipment was in good repair and the never-ending views were",
          "This was a great experience. Our guide was great! The course was intermediate in difficulty (I would not recommend for anyone with recent knee surgery). This kind of hike would be excellent for anyone who wants to experience in relative safety what real rock climbers experience.",
          "Mt. Norquay is located almost directly across the highway from the Banff town site so it is easy to access from Banff or Canmore. We enjoyed this hill because it does not have all the expense and hype of the bigger hills like Lake Louise and Sunshine. The newer part of the",
          "No crowds here... just an amazing ride to an amazing peak with an amazing view! Plus an amazing restaurant!!",
          "We actually stopped here on a whim and were enticed by the chair lift as an alternative to the expensive gondola rides. It was a very sunny day and sunscreen and a hat is recommended. There's a pump jar of sunscreen available across from the ticket counter just in case! We",
          "Drive up this lookout, and have an awesome view of mt rundle, it's free and it is amazing, be careful driving up, as it is steep, but so worth it....",
          "Great evening drive as you have the sun shining down upon Banff from up top at the ski resort. It's a winding trail up and there is a lookout before the top. The drive up reminds one of Switzerland or some road in the Alps. Although it isn't very far up.",
          "Take the chair lift up to the top. It's safe and the views are well worth the 7-minute trip up. The drive is also easy and spectacular.",
          "My daughter and I wanted to get some spectacular views of banff. But refused to pay over $40 each for the gondola. We stumbled across the ski lift at mount norquay. Much cheaper. This was spectacular. The ride up was fun and unique as you are in the open air on the ski lift.",
          "This was one of the best things we did, and we found it by accident. This ski resort isn't closed during the summer - they run their ski lift to the top of Mt Norquay during the day. There's a cafeteria-style lodge at the bottom of the lift, and a great cafe at the top. The",
          "Get up his mountain. The views are spectacular. The chair lifts to the summit and restaurant are a must. The views of Banff and rundle mountain are breathtaking. We have skied here, and summer is just as exciting. Just do it, plus it costs a lot less than Banff gondola,and has",
          "A must do.. Great views of Banff. Spent some time sitting in the red chairs watching the ground squirrels run around and if you're luck you might see some wild sheep at the top car park near the gondola ride!",
          "It was along the road to Mt Norquay that we came across a mama brown bear with her 3 cubs eating dandelion along the side! And the view of Banff from up there makes it even more spectacular! There are 2 red chairs from the lookout where you can sit and enjoy the view.",
          "We got up early to go check out the wildlife and saw a Mule Deer and a whole herd of Big Horn sheep. There is a part of the hill with 2 muskoka chairs and they were just chilling out. Get up early or you will miss them!",
          "Took a short drive up this mountain as an alternative to the gondola as the weather wasn't being nice (we went the following morning instead). Not as high as the gondolas but the views were great nonetheless. Worth a visit if you are looking for something to do for an hour or so.",
          "We were looking forward to seeing Banff from a different viewpoint and riding the open chairlift. Unfortunately, I was given the wrong opening date. We drove back to a switchback area where a wedding party was taking photos. We took in the view, which was still spectacular",
          "Big open meadow, that over looks Banff. Great for picnics, hiking. Or just sitting on those Bright Red Chairs for a grand View. You might even see some of the wild folks around sunning themselves! Just another great Photo Spot!",
          "Buddy and I met up here for a long weekend snowboard trip. We purchased the 3 day pass and decided to go night boarding on Friday. The conditions were not ideal and thought the night trails (like 3 very small) got board very quick. Glad we only wasted our time the first night!",
          "We booked the half-day Via Feratta climb and had a great time!! Our guide, Jim, was phenomenal and made sure everyone was comfortable and safe. There were some members of the group who were a little slower, some a little faster, but no one felt held back or rushed. We are in",
          "We drove to a viewpoint last July (the last 100 yards or so to the ski resort was closed) of Banff City & its surroundings that was spectacular & free (except for the gas). Most tourists seem to concentrate on the gondola up to Sulphur Mountain, not realizing that a drive up Mt.",
          "Snow Tubing! If you are not a skier and want to get your share of fun in the snow, this is it! Many of the trails were blocked due to avalanche threats but the snow tubing was in full force. The chair lift was a good 7 minute ride but once you get to the top there isn't much",
          "Come here for the sunrise. One of the best I've seen. You'll see the tips of the snow capped mountains slowly lights up. When the lighting is right, you can even see Mt Rundle glowing red. There is a lovely viewpoint midway up the drive, no need to go all the way up. I've been",
          "The main gondola was shut down so we took the mt norquay lift. Found a 5.00 off coupon in where magazine found all over banff so it was a great deal. It's not a super long ride but the views are amazing and had some soup and sandwich at the top. Good soup average sandwich and",
          "The drive to Norquay is beautiful and what a treat to have such a great tubing and ski area at the top of this drive. Stop for the spectacular views. On a clear day, you can almost see forever! My grandkids had the best day tubing. It was not so crowded and very affordable.",
          "We had heard quite a few negatives about Norquay. Many said it has a reputation for being steep and icy. It turned out to be a fantastic day. We arrived when the hill opened and were able to move quickly through the rental shop and out to ski. It was very quiet in the morning",
          "This foothill mountain road offers a beautiful view of Banff and the surrounding mountains. Halfway up there is a viewing area that overlooks Banff. There are two red Parks Canada lounger chairs at the edge of the lookout. We were lucky enough to be among a small group of",
          "Easy ride from Banff center. Accommodating staff and easy on and off the mountain. You choose Norquay for Convenience not for breadth and variety of skiing like Louise or Sunshine!",
          "We love the quick drive from Calgary to Banff. Mt. Norquay looks just the same as it did in the 90's and I wonder if the main lodge has ever had any reno's done? It is showing it's age and doesn't have a clean, appealing cafeteria and bathrooms are pretty run down. But, we were",
          "The tubing wasn't for anyone that's done it before elsewhere. Small tubes and only 5 of the same straight slide (good for small kids only). Basically it's not worth the cost for what you get. We suggest you do spend the $20 to take a chairlift to the Cliff Bistro up to the 6,000",
          "After two months above freezing and negligible new snowfall, we expected icy conditions on the hill, to our delight even the steeper parts had good snow. We purchased the Travelzoo coupon for $39 full day, expected to do two runs and be satisfied. Ended up spending 4 hours!",
          "Our kids were learning to downhill ski so we brought them here. It has a good sized learner hill with the magic carpet ride up. From there you can take a lift up and have the option of about 5 green runs. Nothing too long or difficult so it was great for the beginner. I",
          "I'm sure there is a lot more to do here than what we did, however it is worth the drive up the windy road. Be sure to stop and sit on the red chairs and take some photos in the hillside!! It was so fun!!!!",
          "I did the suspended bridge trek, it is worth every penny and what an experience! While the suspended bridge is the highlight, it is the entire trek that adds to making the experience enjoyable, also a good forum to meet other travelers. It includes a gondola ride to the top from",
          "We've seen the view from the meadow about 3/4 of the way up the mountain in the daytime, and this trip we drove up it (not too steep or scary) at night, and the view was spectacular! Well worth a 30 minute investment of time. It's about 10 minutes up to the fabulous viewpoint,",
          "It was fun, we had a great time. It was $30 a person and we were there over 2 hours. You didn't need to walk up the mountain as they had a moving walkway like airports do that took you and the tube all the way up. This is my second time going and I will be going back",
          "We picked Mount Norquay as it gave the best value for lessons. We signed up for group lessons, only to receive one on one. A nice surprise. My instructor(Paul Arney) was very knowledgable and a great instructor. The resort had good parking, was well groomed, and was a positive",
          "My daughter learned to snowboard from Michelle and I want to say thank you for starting her snowboarding on such a positive experience. She graduated quickly to the chairlift and had a wonderful time. All the staff at Mt Norquay are friendly and positive. She is looking forward",
          "Mt. Norquay is a super hill that is a lot quieter then Sunshine or Lake Louise (and a nice break from those big crowds). When I was there on the weekend the only other people on the hill were some ski racing kids. When I went up the chairlift to the black diamond runs I was",
          "You're in Banff and you have half a day or more then head out to Mt. Norquay for an enjoyable day sking. Hill is enjoyable, tubing is fun at the end of the day and it's super close to Banff. Plus when we went there was a groupon for the lift ticket!",
          "We had a very disappointing experience with the private snowboarding instructor on 2/6. I will briefly describe our experience here. My girlfriend has never snowboarded before. We thought the fastest way for her to pick up snowboarding is to take a private lesson such that the",
          "This was the first time going tubing. It was a lot of fun. There was a lot of people but the wait wasn't long at all. It moved quite fast. :)",

          "I used to spend my time at sunshine and Lake Louise, but much prefer Mount Norquay now. Nice to have fewer crowds to fight with. I find the grooming excellent, and if you head to the farthest chair, Mystic express, its got nice blue runs, and a few moguls too. The runs are",
          "Norquay has snowmaking and grooming that make up for it being so far east, almost in the rainshadow of the Canadian Rockies. It has great easy groomers, some intermediate terrain, and ~400 m vertical double blacks that will slow down even daredevils, yet without putting people",
          "Great family mountain. Tubing was great, tons of fun for kids and adults! Only a small beginner run with a magic carpet...but the green run was doable for a beginner child. Kinda pricey as I'm used to the great options in the Lower Mainland but it is Banff! This is our",
          "Went here to try snow tubing. It was fun amd do easy to get to from banff. Tried the starfish ( spinning all thecway down) and glad yo say i tried it but wont likely do it again. The pin drop is super cool! Will definately be back!",
          "Been to Banff a few times but this is the first time trying the night skiing at Mt. Norquay (Friday's). They have something for everyone on a flood light slope: piste skiing, park skiing and even the opportunity to enter a GS or Slalom race, great fun!!",
          "This is the biggest secret in Banff. The hill is not huge like Lake Louise but the terrain it has suits every ability from beginner to super difficult steeps. The hill is also minutes from Banff as opposed to the drive to Sunshine plus long gondola ride or the long drive to",
          "Me and a few of my friends went tubing for just under a couple of hours. This is a great activity for families and people of all ages. This was my first time tubing and I really enjoyed it, we all were giggling like a bunch of little kids. If you want something fun to do",
          "As the title suggests, going to Norquay a week after a small snowfall left me a bit disappointed. The snow was very hard-packed in some areas and it was difficult to slow down after hitting jumps or carving quickly down. It was very busy, but that was no issue. Finding a spot to",
          "We planned a ski trip getaway to Mt Norquay. Went to get lessons for my wife and 2 kids. We bought a 2 hr private lesson and got an amazing instructor..Fred M...he was so worth every penny. The difference my family had in those 2 hr was amazing. He was very patient and",

          "We went to Mt. Norquay during Christmas, it's very small and only a few runs. If you bought the Big3 lift ticket, the other two ski areas are better with more snow. When we were there, Norquay was solid ice like snow crud. I felt at the last stretch of the traverse, when I",
          "Our family of six has kids from 16-4 years old. Norquay has some nice short beginner runs and blue runs with moguls for the teens. My husband and oldest love the North American chair and it's double black diamonds. This is NOT a huge hill. If you want something different for",

          "We (3 adults) are new to skiing and booked a 2hour lesson with instructor Stephanie Rose. She was excellent and we highly recommend her as an instructor. Within 40 minutes we had graduated from the magic carpet area onto the chairlift. Her ability to build our confidence and",

          "Very nice place. Lots of families.  Staff was helpful and helped me get on and off the tubing.  Lots of fun",
          "We switched from Nakiska to Norquay. We heard they had a great kids ski program so we put our kids in lessons and bought passes. Our kids like the hill because the runs are very beginner and intermediate friendly. The ski hill's coaching \u2026",
          "A great local hill. Don\u2019t discount it because it\u2019s small. It is a \u201charder hill\u201d and brings me back to how snowboarding and skiing should really be!",
          "Nice little place. Good for skiing competitions",
          "Great ski/tubing. On the other hand. The canteen is too over priced. Just a hot dog is a whooping 13.50 thats just the hot dog. No fries no drinks",
          "Nice little hill with something for everyone. It's the smallest resort in the national park but has the best prices and rarely any lines. Has enough runs for a day on the mountain.",
          "My ski instructor Cameron was the best person ever. Super chill and really easy to get along with, highly recommend this instructor to anyone trying to learn how to ski!",
          "Great mountain which is often overlooked by its bigger neighbours. We had a half day here, due to later commitments, and had a blue sky day. If your in town please don't ignore it.",
          "Very versatile ski hill with options for everyone. A strong mix of run difficulties and lengths. A good selection of dining options. Great place for a day on the slopes by your self or with your friends.",
          "Pricey but beautiful! A lot of Aussie employees who r friendly, courteous and helpful! They have a Tube Park that is a ton of fun!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0e",
          "The views are amazing, we spent australia day tubing here. We were pleasantly surprised to hear an array of Australian music pumping as we got there. Thanks to the staff for an amazing day that we had.",
          "Really enjoyable hill.  4 lifts so it is a bit on the small side but my kid and me had fun",
          "5 minutes from Banff. Beautiful lodge. Good beginner and expert runs. Some blue runs. Overall great place to ski.",
          "I had a wonderful day.  The mountain and skiing where wonderful.  The staff was friendly.  I was there on opening day.  The food is really low end.  I wouldn't plan eating there.   He ran the lift.",
          "Great little resort with a good (if relatively small) selection of runs. Great ski school.\n\nUnfortunately let down by the shuttle bus not turning up on either of the days we tried to use it... One of those days we had a ski lesson booked and so had no choice but to spend $45 on a taxi.",
          "Small but had a few decent runs. Good for a quick rip before hitting apres!",
          "Our family loved the tubing at Mt. Norquay.  The lines were short and there\u2019s a moving carpet and many lanes to tube. \nThe chalet actually had good food.",
          "What a wonderful place.  Beautiful mountain sking.  Nice lodge. But the staff is what makes the space special. Rentals were easy.  Staff shared lots of information.  The aki school staff were excellent!.  I would highly recommend using the school at any level. For us beginners, it make the experience incredible.",
          "Beautiful views from the chairlift up to the chalet. We had some beers and service was great. Chalet a bit dated, definitely needs a patio to take advantage of the spectacular view! It wasn\u2019t too touristy which was a bonus. Felt a bit overpriced at $37/ticket, would feel that $20 is more reasonable.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous place to ride the lift and see Banff and the surrounding mountains. We went mid-October and the weather was just starting to cool down.there was no snow but the top was very cool, so plan accordingly. Great spot for just \u2026",
          "Great place for beginners to lean.  Plenty of open space.  Give tubing a go, no skill required. Good fun",
          "Went tubing with the family,  the hill is beautiful with 7 tubing lanes. Lines were fast, the staff operating the park were courteous,  however my daughter was extremely scared which was unbeknowning to us which resulted in one ride down. \u2026",
          "Terrible transport staff, but the rest of the staff are lovely. Very expensive in comparison to other resorts and skiing very limited. Just go to Sunshine.",
          "Family fun. Affordable. Best tubing around. Decent tuck shop. Just a pity Cliffhouse Bistro is not open yet.",
          "Smaller mountain - if you\u2019re in banff and short on time this is certainly a good spot to hit the slopes but all around not my favorite.  Highly recommend for beginner skiers.",
          "Took our niece here. Thought it was maybe a wee bit pricey, however no. Fantastic fun. Super fast runs also a slalom course.  Felt sorry for one mum with her daughter who once ip top was too scared. Obviously had to slide down once but no refunds. Friendly  staff.",
          "Decent resort with some really steep runs. Price is very competitive",
          "Beautiful place. Tubing little slow. Mountain is great \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Steep and awesome for a day! We skied Sunshine village in the morning and norquay in the afternoon for a killer day!",
          "Such a great place, so many options for all skill levels. It's very beautiful",
          "I love this place because I live and work here. It's the best place I've ever worked with lots of fun.",
          "Beautiful!  Awesome on the chair lift.  I am a senior and the operators slowed it right down for me.  Blanket for my knees.  Lunch at the top which was delicious.  Saw a bear on the way down.  Shuttle from the train station to the mountain!  A great experience!",
          "Nice area. Good little rail park to play in. Not the most runs and its more for begginers but lovely views on the way up and at the top. Great chicken wings for lunch.",
          "Great for beginners and fast short runs in you like to hop like a jack rabbit.",
          "Great place for snowboarding. From easy to steep and jumps.",
          "Beautiful, everyone you can fit in a vehicle for the price of one lift ticket or something like that... It was a good deal.",
          "What a great little hail close to Banff. They have great weekday specials once a month. Perfect place to play hooky, for a quick trip to the mountains",
          "Great spot for beginners because it isn\u2019t overly crowded, the terrain is small, it\u2019s affordable and the resort staff are helpful and friendly.",
          "I came here in September and I bought a sightseeing chairlift pass. The views were amazing, but I found it was pricey as to what you get.  The ticket was $37 and you basically get one ride up to the mountain.  It looks like it'd be a good hill to ski in the winter though.",
          "Was a good day,  slopes are very steep and icy in the mornings, but nice in the afternoon once the sun has got to them",
          "The tubing was so much fun they just need to have all lanes open",
          "Absolutely out of this world. Had the best powder in over 5 years. So blessed!",
          "Excellent value for money.  On the drive up saw mountain sheep. Excellent views from the top and the restaurant was great, with huge portions. Well worth the money.",
          "Small hill, but a gooder! Lots of room on a good day",
          "Tubing staff are rude and unhelpful. The girl at the counter said she was \u2018doing me a favour\u2019 by trying (unsuccessfully) to give me a refund after realising that the hill was too steep for me and walking down not even going down one run and going to the desk 10 minutes after purchasing a ticket.",
          "Good structure to accommodate large groups or just small families.  You can stay warm indoors or go outside and practice one of the winter sports. You can bring your own food and heat it in one of the microwaves available or buy something \u2026",
          "it was the carpool Wednesday twenty bucks for a day of skiing fantastic conditions great hospitality the upstairs bar is excellent food",
          "We loved our summer visit to the summit using the chairlift. There were no crowds in the afternoon and the ride up was lovely. We saw so many mountain goats on the hill and even at the top right on the stairs! The ride down gives you great \u2026",
          "Stunning viewpoint,just 5 mins driving from Banff!\nLot of space for parking.View on mountains and whole Banff city",
          "The lifts are very slow and the food is too expensive. My friend was tripped by a snowborder on his first time down the lift. He was then forced to sit out for the rest of the trip and I couldn't ski for half an hour. Very poor reaction to a person tripping on a snowboard.",
          "Went tubing on a Friday morning. Great time, low crowd. Look forward to coming back.",
          "Small, friendly and relaxed place. As a new skiier I found the options a bit limited. The blue runs were steeper than what I've seen at other resorts.",
          "We skied the trifecta and Mt Norquay just came up short compared to Sunshine and Lake Louise. The resort is on the smaller side and not much was open (it was early season). Not a bad place to ski though.",
          "One of the most picturesque places to ski or snowboard in Banff Park, second to Lake Louise. Good mix of runs.",
          "Either summer or winter, this is one location you cannot miss on a trip to the Canadian Rockies.",
          "Very close to the Banff village! Saves time to go there, and the price was more reasonable than other ski resort in Banff",
          "Great lol family resort with some good but short steep hills",
          "Great day with the family.  Perfect for families beginning or to intermediate level with lots if blue and black runs.",
          "Great winter escape. Snowshoeing this time was beautiful.",
          "Had a great weekend of early bird skiing with the family.  Minimal wait time.  Wished there were more runs open",
          "Good fun, lots of different terrain.  Not crowded at all.",
          "Wonderful place in the summer. My brother got married here and it went really well I would say. Very beautiful",
          "When it snows it's good. Not many runs for the price though. Usually super lied and icy.",
          "Great place for tubing and the sites are amazing.  Great day for the family.",
          "Super fun place to rip around and do night laps at",
          "Fantastic tubing hill! There were great options for runs it was just a bit expensive and very busy.",
          "A fun place to go snow tubing.  The que was about 10 min",
          "The only reason it is worth going here is for there $50 car load price. This mountain is really poorly laid out with lifts that are really out dated. The terrain wasn't even that good.",
          "Had a good time tubbing, however it's really busy and I felt like they didn't have the room to welcome so many people in the tubbing chalet. Staff was also very friendly.",
          "Tubing was a lot of fun and surprisingly a lot faster than it looks. Don\u2019t forget to keep your feet up! :D",
          "Bluebird Day, with a well-defined temperature inversion in the valley below.",
          "Kids loved the tube park. $10 off the ticket price for the last hour.",
          "Small resort but there is never any wind or queues and the prices are good.",
          "It's so pretty there! Very nice views \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Flew up from California to visit friends in Calgary, and we all came up here to snow tube. I ice skate but never had tubed before. The setup is well organized and works well. No skill required. There's lots of instruction from the staff \u2026",
          "Great staff, clean and family orientated. My kids love coming here...",
          "Great small resort. A gem in Banff",
          "Doing the Via Ferrata on Mount Norquay has to be one of the best fun days you can possibly imagine. Our guide Kim was really friendly helped those who struggled. The views were outstanding and the climb itself tested every part of your body.  So much so, by the time the climb was over... bed was calling!l",
          "Beautiful memories and beautiful pictures I took from that place",
          "Good place for my kids to learn how to snowboard!",
          "Very nice place to visit.  I bought the tickets online the day prior and they had a pretty difficult time using their system to get us going.  Thankfully there wasn't a line.  The views are really spectacular from the top, but it is just the one vantage point.  Still, worth the cost to get great views of Banff and the valley.",
          "Wahou! A great place to enjoy the nature",
          "Great ski resort for intermediate skiing and snowboarding.",
          "An awesome place to visit if you're ever in Banff. It is less popular than the Banff gondola but also a lot less expensive. The views from the top were stunning and there is a tea house that offers a fill menu of food and drinks. We saw \u2026",
          "I had an AMAZING time on the Via Ferrata! We had a great couple guides and the trip was a once in a lifetime type of activity!!! I went with a group of other cancer survivors while on a climbing expedition trip. The Via Ferrata was easily \u2026",
          "Best Chairlift and so beautiful! I saw 2 bears!!! One while I was coming down :) A little black bear napping :)",
          "Took the Via Ferrata explorer route, which was fantastic trip. Especially for someone who doesn't have much experience nor climbing experience. Any missing gear is provided, like climbing boots, raincoats and a backpack. Definitely \u2026",
          "Loved skiing here. Pricing is a bit easier on the wallet than other places. Runs were shorter, but for our family of beginners, that was ok. Decent variety on the greens. We had a great day!",
          "Great price. Fun hill.",
          "First time visit must be great for family sking and chalet looks comfy to lunch. Go visit pls.",
          "Fkn awesome",
          "Great snow, no crowds mid week, and terrific staff.",
          "Norquay in the summer truly is Banff's hidden gem.  If your looking for great views of the valley, and and awesome lunch without the line-ups, I strongly suggest the Cliff House Bistro.",
          "Early season pricing is very affordable - good for learning.",
          "Snow tubing was awesome! So much fun!",
          "Kids loved the tubing! Had a blast",
          "It was real fun, we were there in the morning for via ferrate tour, which is basically mountain climbing Adventure. It was awesome within the lap of nature.",
          "We visited in noon of summer weekday. Enough parking. Very few visitors. About US $30 per person chairlift charge. Wonderful view.",
          "Norquay is probably good for skiing, not so much in the summer. To buy a lift ticket to go to the top of the mountain and the only thing to do is go to a overpriced restaurant I can think of better ways to spend my money in Banff. There are no trails to hike, you can\u2019t summit the mountain and animals are scarce. Not good value.",
          "I hate the windy road up but the facility is easy to navigate once you get there",
          "My fiance and I went tubing at Mt. Norway. We had a tonne of fun as we spend down the lanes, and the line up I find went quick considering how many people were there. The only downside is that they close down at 4pm and didn't realize it \u2026",
          "The snow tubing was all much fun!",
          "Great views, close to Banff and Canmore.",
          "Visited to take part in the Via Ferrata. Unfortunately it was a wet and cloudy day and so understandably cancelled. It was nice to be given a free lift pass to the top of Mount Norquay and back though as a little compensation.",
          "Tubing was awesome...kids loved it.",
          "Nice enverment",
          "No line ups, good terrain, and amazing views.",
          "Beautiful view, with high chairlift experience and mini rock climbing in the summer. Great place to ski/snowboard in the winter .",
          "A great mountain for all levels. I am a beginner and the green lines were a perfect for learning and transitioning. Staff at lifts were super friendly and caring. Advanced snowboarders also had fun on the black runs- it all depends on Snow \u2026",
          "It has been some years since I have been here. One of the best views of the valley. Wear pants though as there can be a difference from the townsite temperature wise.",
          "Gorgeous view one switchback from the top (at the stone wall), and relatively uncrowded. This was in early October",
          "Norquay is a smaller hill but provides lots of different terrain. Today the snow was largely groomed, but we found some fresh fluffy stuff off the Mystic Chair. Good weather, good skiing. Great day.",

          "Beautiful landscapes and amazing structure to sliding.",
          "Great view of Banff Town, Banff Hotel, and other beautiful landmarks.",
          "Great skiing, friendly staff and even awesome rental place\n\nI had a great time at Mt. Norquay. We were there for the start of the 2014/15 season. I used the last hour pass (20 CAD) and it turned out to be the best decision ever. Only 20% of \u2026",
          "This is the hill my children learned to ski on. Never a lineup, very friendly \"lifties\".",
          "Great doing the Via Ferrata 4 hours trail.\nGuide Liam did a great job.",
          "Very nice and comfortable. Everything you need to have a good time is there. If you are skillful at skiing or you just want to learn and practice, this is the right place. Even to those who want to enjoy the scenery.",
          "Great place. But I do beleive there are few tables. Staff are excellent. It is obviously great because people from all over the world come to ski. Love it.",
          "Such a great ski hill and lodge for families",
          "Awesome views. It's surreal and just amazing all round.",
          "Scenic october is closed wished Google would have said so. Drove all the way there just to find out its closed. I guees i could have called first.",

          "Via Ferrata at Norquay was the best decision I made!!  This adventure is perfect for the thrill-seeker in you.  There are different levels of intensity so it is perfect for everyone!  I did the 4-hour Ridgeline Tour (because the more \u2026",

          "Great food, breathtaking views, nice staff and great ski lift.",

          "Small but convenient location to Banff town. Only place that offers night skiing in the area, would recommend if interested in park laps or beginner learner.",
          "We drove here to ride the lift to the top. Had my baby in my carrier strapped to me and they would not let me ride the ski lift even though the bar could still come down. Unfortunately, waste of a drive",
          "Fun!! Kids loved the tube hill. Parking is okay.. quite a hike up to the chalet for little kids. Maybe next time we will being a sled to haul them up that hill!",
          "It's fast food if you love fast food great place to go if you don't don't go there",
          "Great little hill in the winter, awesome in the summer too! Visit visit visit!",
          "AMAZING facility. Pretty much everything you would need, they have!! Great and friendly staff! I wish we had more time to spend here!!",
          "I brought my son and some friends here to celebrate his 13th birthday in early February.  The staff was fantastic and found us the best price for our group. Despite the frigid temperatures, we all had a great day tubing.  The kids are still talking about it!",
          "We arrived to go tubing but they were fully booked, so they advised to come back another day. Looked like a fun place though. We did have a play in the snow though, a giant snow mound built for the kids was good.",
          "An easy and short drive from Banff, making quickee ski trips possible. The runs are short compared to some other mountains in the area, and for the most part either green or black. Lots of them are steep. There are a variety of chairs to \u2026",
          "I tried the chairlift. Nothing fancy and over priced but great views. Also fewer people if you want to avoid the crowds. Didnt go in the restaurant and also not a whole lot of space to walk around up there but enough to take photos.",
          "Good mountain to hike! You have a nice view from the top also! I don't really ski on that mountain, just hike!",
          "Great tubing park with great staff. Went for a full day and had a blast!  Ski runs were awesome with lots of powder and almost no lineups. They got rid of the stairs to the front of the lodge which is awesome. Lots of ski instructors \u2026",
          "Perhaps the most spectacular, stunning views of Banff's Bow Valley are found at Mount Norquay's one-of-a-kind Cliffside Bistro from their unique sightseeing chairlift. The vistas will take your breath away. The personal service will steal your heart. Absolute magic. The value is unbeatable! Hurry! One of Banff's best-kept secrets!",

          "An amazing place for families.",
          "Friendly and fun ! Our go to hill in Alberta",
          "The chairs are old and slow. The chair to the nice view of Banff only let's a few people go in bursts and then has a long gap with no chairs on the cable. At least there's a cafe up there so after the long wait where the classes and racers get priority in line at least you can get some food at the top.",
          "Nice mountain, beautiful scenery, don't do the via ferrata tour though, the guide we had was awful",
          "I did the Via Ferrata in June after a snow storm. Could not do the summiteer that I had wanted to do because of snow accumulation, but, did do the Ridge walk. I would recommend this in any form and plan on coming back in the near future to do the summiteer",
          "Steep if that's your speed",
          "We have visited the tubbing runs the last couple of years and the whole family has a blast. We have 5, 9 and 11 year old kids and they all have fun. Our 5 year old daughter goes down on her own. Couple of tips, get here early as it will get \u2026",
          "We experienced tubing here. It was so much fun than I expected. Course are  long enough, stuff are friendly and kind. It cost $35 but you can find $5 off on magazine \"where\"",
          "Very good place for skiing!",
          "I was in Banff in 1959. On a 'teen tour'. You just have to see the Canadian Rockies. I went up Mount Norquay. And Lake Louise was, for a long time, the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen.",
          "Too small, lifts old and break down. Not well sign posted on slopes",
          "Via Ferrata Explorer was an amazing experience. Perfect for beginners :)",
          "It had an amazing view and I just haven't ever seen anything like it.",
          "Just butchered our order, Long wait, will not be back.  Food was good with the small amount of compensation food once they came to explain what happened after an hour later.  I don't mind paying a fortune here but service should be of the utmost importance if you expect to charge a premium.",
          "We came to norquay for tubing.  Amazing views from the hill.  Staff were great and friendly.  I was disappointed because staff shut down the tubing run about 20 minutes prior to posted time of 4pm online.  We only had 4 runs before it \u2026",
          "Good for beginners and advanced.",
          "I love Mount Norquay.  It is an excellent hill for kids, training, and families.  Lots of parking, great staff, and good facilities.  Best place near Banff for lessons.",

          "Climbing Norquay was the best thing I did my entire vacation",
          "We did the 5 hour Via Ferrata tour. We were told the 6+ hour one basically just included a free lunch with beer after, but the price was significantly different. \n\nIt was safe, you are totally strapped in and the technology is ridiculous. \u2026",
          "Decent amount of snow. Went for snow shoeing. Trails are beautiful. Tubing looks fun too. Will go for tubing next time.",
          "Awesome first day of the year!",
          "Super great  tube park",
          "Try the Via Veratta for memories of a lifetime and views that take your breath away. This is available in summer and it is an unforgettable experience. I can't speak about the ski resort because we went in June but the summit of Mt Norquay \u2026",

          "Lovely ski resort.",
          "Via Ferrata was fabulous! A little apprehensive when we started. The guides are great!!",

          "I went to Mount Norquay for an evening with my partner and her family. We went primarily for the tubing. I was a little sceptical to start with, being a group of adults I figured this may be a bit expensive and more so entertainment for \u2026",
          "Expected a small local hill but was surprised to find a lot of steep runs. Don't let the trail map fool you, the only green runs are in the kiddy park and most everything on the hill are steep and tight blue to black runs.  That's not a bad \u2026",
          "Loved the climb and the guides were fantastic,  especially with a new climber.",
          "We arrived at 11 am to go tubing at it AAs fairly quiet till around 1 when the lines got quite long.  The park is fun and the staff are great",
          "Beautiful views and the bistro at the top was amazing! Great service and great food. The cost of the chairlift was very reasonable. Would definitely do this again.",
          "Really decent ski hill. I've never visited until this year. Very convenient as it is right next to Banff, and you can drive right up to the lifts (no gondola). The downside is that it is smaller than resorts in the area. It is kept up \u2026",
          "Via Ferrata a Must to do in Banff\ud83d\udcaa Amazing .  Logan excellent guide.",
          "Super fun lift and different view of the surroundings than the Banff Gondola",
          "Great short hike up the Stony Squaw Mountain",
          "Depending on conditions. Obviously better with powder, and if you had a big dump then you can try some of the expert runs. Otherwise if you're not very good stay away from it.",
          "Climbed the via firrata and had a blast!",
          "Beautiful view of Banff! Great service at the top!",
          "The mountain is smaller but has some fun terrain and I could easily fill multiple days exploring the area in depth.    Small crowds,  no lines,  nice staff,  good food at the lodge restaurant and bar.",
          "I did a guided hiking tour, it was amazing!",
          "Super fun and a good work out even though there is a magic carpet you still walk uphill to some of the chutes.",

          "Good until I messed up my ankle :[",

          "My favorite hill has more variety then the other hills in a compact package",
          "The scenery and chairlift ride are breath- taking. The restaurant at the top of the mountain has stunning views with an incredible menu serving delicious food and drinks. Can't wait to come back!",
          "It's a great mountain top with a great view. They run the chairlift year round to the top of the mountain and it can be a cheaper alternative to the Banff gondola ($35 vs. $65). They have 2 cafeteria areas (one at top and one at the bottom) \u2026",
          "I absolutely loved this hill. It is smaller than sunshine but it was not as busy either. When you got down the hill it was only a moment before you're on a lift back up. It is a great hill to learn on and has a lot of runs for all levels. There is also a awesome tube park which was super fun!",
          "It was wedding day for my son we love it",
          "Stunning views at the top of the gondola and mountaintop restaurant. \nParking was easy and bought lift tickets right away. \nGondola is actually open-air chair lifts. \nAt the top, there\u2019s a restaurant and bar.",

          "Tubing was great fun and a perfect way to spend a sunny Sunday afternoon. Highly recommended. The regular runs were where the fun was at. Fast paced and up to five tubes at once (maybe more). Skip the skills section if the lines are long, it's pretty slow moving and not nearly as much fun.",
          "Nothing open on the lower slopes. Not even a bathroom for hikers. Pretty scenery tho",
          "Sooooo much fun.   Loved it here.   Rubbing at its finest.",
          "Perfect place fo ski and snow tubing.\nMy kids enjoyed lot there.",
          "Today has been great; a little icy. We went for $2 day and it was busy. But the longest we waited for a lift was 4min. Nice and sunny today, lifts were fast, staff were active and helpful. Rental people were slow. They should work at improving the rental line speed. Can't wait to finish the day!",
          "We went tubing and it was very fun! We had a great day and cookies at Mount Norquay.",
          "Went for tubing and had a blast with friends and family. It was a great way to spend a Saturday!! I would highly recommend it, it may appear intimidating but once you try it, you're hooked:) Has great music and play area for little one who didn't qualify to tube.",
          "Awesome view!",
          "We made a stop here to give tubing a try and had a great time.  Our visit was on a weekday which basically translated to no lines - just grab a tube, head up the snow carpet, pick a chute, get a push (and a spin if you wish) to send you \u2026",
          "It's a great place for the beginners and more advanced skiers. You can get a good deal on a ski pass at Costco.",
          "A great place for beginners and black diamond skiiers/snowboarders. There are 3 parking lots to accomodate for this place. The hills are groomed nicely and good amount of space to avoid skiing into people. There are two restaurants in here. \u2026",
          "Really small, all the other ski resorts in the area are nicer",
          "AWESOME ski hill not far from Banff it\u2019s not super large but if you are a experienced skier or snowboarder you will enjoy the North American lift.",
          "Lesser known hill, but has everything you need.",
          "Very nice, yo even in the summer!",
          "Stayed there in the summer to hike the Cascade Mountain.\nIncredible trail, very beautiful - very recommend to go to the top. Even its a little bit hard.",
          "Just went on the Via Ferrata (4hr) at Norquay - absolutely fantastic experience!! The sights were amazing, the \"scary stuff\" was excellent and the guide was top notch.\nWell worth the price and an adventure you'll want to share with some friends.",
          "The snow grooming team at Mt Norquay does a remarkable job of maintaining the ski slopes in terrific condition throughout the season.",
          "Absolutely stunning lookouts and enjoyed the tubing activity. Had great fun",
          "Norquay's a great ski hill with something to offer for all abilities. It's not as big as the other two hills, but also not nearly as busy. There are a few negatives though: The lodge is rather small and a lot of the tables are reserved for \u2026",
          "Beautiful place and a great time. Minus the one lady who really doesn't like it when you let go of the tube handle in front of her",
          "My son and I visited Mt Norquay for Toonie day.  This is my first time skiing at this hill and I absolutely loved it.  The runs are the perfect length for my son to not tire too easily and there is a nice combination of difficult and easy \u2026",
          "Oh talk about fun!! Excellent 10 out of 10",
          "You should try out \u201eTubing\u201c in the winter. Ask after a few runs when you feel comfortable if you can do \u201ethe starfish\u201c. It will be the most intense experience of that day. It feels like gravity pulls you apart when you do that stunt.",
          "I went there for a school ski trip, it's was one of the best times I've ever had snow boarding",
          "Good hill for skiiers, it has plenty of moguls and a fair amount of runs. Only 5 min drive from Banff.",
          "Good starters slope",
          "Great staff. The place is family oriented, but not worth the money comparing to Sunshine village or Lake L that offer better runs and better amenities for the same price.",
          "Awesome hill! More runs that I expected. Snow was good. Lifts were not busy (I went on a Monday). The lodge was cozy and not over crowded.",
          "Summer and no flies got to love it",
          "The views were breathtaking. There's a very small hill for beginner skiers, but it's mostly for more advanced skiers/snowboarders.",
          "Mount Norquay is my home hill. It's a fantastic place, I'm there nearly every weekend of the winter. I've been skiing a long time, and the quay will always be where I feel most at home and welcomed.",
          "Not the best resort in the Rockies but it definitely has its moments. I have had great days skiing the North American chair and great groomer laps. It has a lot more steep runs than Nakiska and a lot more terrain. It is conveniently close \u2026",
          "Went for Via Feratta and was taken super good care by the staff. The best organized activity I ever experienced. Full equipment and clothing was provided. Restaurant on top is very good! Want to go back again.",
          "Awesome place for winter activities. Although it is picking up for summer activities as well. We go regularly for tubing activities and I must say we adults become the kids. \nFriendly faces, 2 eateries for the energy. All you need is proper \u2026",
          "Luved it. Stoney Squaw hike amazing!!  B",
          "Great family ski hill. Runs aren't as long as you might find at Sunshine or Louise, but they're good for beginners or intermediate skiers. There are black diamonds as well. Lodge is nice, but extremely busy and packed during lunchtime.",
          "If you are an experienced skier, this is a decent place for you! The big chair takes you to some sweet terrain! There are steep slopes but the runs are short and the snow here isn't the best. This is a great place to ski to your hearts \u2026",
          "My kids enjoy the ice sports. A good place for the family",
          "Just came back from the cascade amphitheatre hike. Absolutely gorgeous nature, spectacular views and a great workout :-)",

          "There's a great viewpoint halfway up My. Norquay where you can pull over, sit in an Adirondack chair, and enjoy a beautiful view of Banff and the mountains to the South.  The ski hill has some amazing, steep runs, and the Lone Pine \u2026",
          "We went tuning for the afternoon and it was incredible.  The kids and adults all loved it. There's a great lodge nearby for food and drinks. Well worth the money",
          "Took the chair lift to the lookoff in August.  Far less expensive (under $100 for 2 adults and 1 youth) and less populated than the Sulfur Mountain gondola but still a nice view in spite of the smoke from BC fires.  Would not suggest eating \u2026",
          "Don't even bother night skiing, small cool mountain!",
          "Great fun. Loved the green and blue runs. Easy enough for beginners nice and wide. Makes it better they have toonie days. Can't go wrong with $2 skiing.",

          "husband liked to ski\ni liked the ski lodge",
          "Good skiing, not a huge number of run options for developing beginners (building confidence but still just want to stay on green runs), but if you're just starting out they have a nice short green run that is perfect for learning. I did my \u2026",
          "Amazing snow and great runs! We went here for toonie Tuesday, which was awesome value for money! Sadly half the lifts were closed causing the lines for the chairlift to be quite long.  Staff were great though, And pumped the lines through \u2026",
          "Fun tubing but really big lineup.",
          "Excellent hill! We went on toonie day, which offered some insane savings! It was very busy due to that, but longer wait lines really aren't a concern when you pay $2 for a whole day of boarding. Great snow conditions! Highly recommend checking out.",
          "Great place to ski for different levels - beginner, intermediate and advanced. Also there is a snow tubing place beside, which is extremely fun. To reach the ski area you have to take right just before the snow tubing place.",
          "Awesome experience @snow tubing..hope to do it again",
          "Helpful and friendly staff. A great place to learn to ski and less expensive than some of the other options.",

          "Some trails. Not many activities during summer time.",
          "Great hill for kids to learn on.  Lessons and instructors are great with children.  Not as busy as some of the other hills.  Only downside is lack of seating in the lodge, but overall a great family hill",
          "Great place to ski, event location rustic",
          "Our family went tubing yesterday and the magic carpet that pulls you up the hill was broken so you had to hike up the hill to tube down. They were offering a \u201cdiscount\u201d because of this but it was only $5 off of a $30 charge. I feel like it \u2026",
          "Very beautiful scenery, excellent place to go skiing. Would recommend it.",
          "Not a bad MTN, but not Louise or Sunshine.",
          "It's a very small mountain compared to the others around, but it punches above its weight.  Runs are very nice and there is something for everyone.  My kids and neice agree that they have the best lessons.",

          "Norquay is one of little gems. Family type hill with broad variety of terrain. Prices are 20% lower than surrounding hills. It still offers Toonie Wednesdays. Bus from Banff. The tea house at the top of Norquay chair is worth the view and detour. Great views of Banff.",

          "Being scared of heights I was a bit apprehensive about this, however I am really glad that I joined the rest of my family. I had a few wobbly moments (the first 10 minutes is the most challenging) but enjoyed the experience. The teenagers loved it. The views were incredible",

          "I went with 3 teenagers on a 2.5 hrs trip in mid June. This is a great way to enjoy the mountain if you are adventurous but don't want to sacrifice safety. The equipment was good. In addition to the standard things like helmet and harnesses, they also provide water-proof",
          "We saved this for the last day and it was well worth it and a great value. Our guide Alison was great and we had an awesome group. We did the 4hr tour and I would recommend doing the 4hr at a minimum. You get to the east peak of Mt. Nourquay and it makes the journey feel",
          "I absolutely loved this experience! We did the 4 hour Ridgewalker excursion since there is no way that I could have crossed the 3 wire suspension bridge for the 6 hour one. I have a slight fear of heights and was definitely nervous, but the guide, Chris, was very easy going",
          "This is something that people with mostly any fitness level can do. It has been on my bucket list for the past 2 years and I wasn't disappointed. There were a couple rapid heart beat moments but that was the fun part. You feel totally safe the whole time, any fear dissipated",

          "Me and my friends took part in the 2 hour Via Ferrata tour. I had never done anything like this before. It is a cross between rock climbing and mountaineering (sort of). They call it an assisted climb. You are harnessed in on most areas of the mountain and begin ascending up",
          "I really can't say enough about this experience. I had seen all the reviews on Trip Advisor and even first hand from an associate...but we were still blown away! I have always wanted to try rock climbing but at 50 thought that ship had sailed..not so! I felt totally safe yet",
          "The views are breathtaking. Dress warmly. The guides are great. My teenagers really loved this activity.",
          "Late season we were lucky enough to get an instructor all to ourselves which meant we could go at our own pace. We did the 2.5 hour tour which was enough to get us high enough for amazing views of the mountains and the town without taxing my recovering knee injury. It feels",

          "I did the 2.5 hour Explorer version of this adventure, this was perfect for me. No previous climbing experience , really had no idea what I was in for. Not for the faint of heart, if you're prone to panic or really can't function when faced with heights don't do it. Having said",
          "We didn't know what to think and so were scared this was a bucket list for us. We have never done anything like this before in all the years we have been going to Banff / Canada. Kevin was our guide and I think he thought me and my wife were a bit mad. The day was fantastic",
          "If you've wanted to try some mountaineering but didn't know where to start, this is the place! Recommend this for any hiker wanting a new experience in the mountains. Safe but gets the heart rate up! Our guide, Katsu was awesome! Low-key guy with a great sense of humor!",
          "We had so much fun with our guide climbing the Via Ferrata: you get all the thrill of a real mountain climb whilst being safely clipped on and without needing years of experience. The views are amazing as you climb! We did the 2 hour tour, but there are also 4 and 6 hour trips",
          "Had a great time. Weather was fair, some strong winds and a little rain. Our guide was excellent. Views were amazing. Ridge walker 4 hour tour highly recommended. Our 12 yr old daughter completed no problem. Staff were great..very accommodating. Thought the pricing was a",

          "This was the best thing I did in Canada. Absolutely love it. A real adrenalin fuelled adventure. Even if you are not great with heights you feel safe as you are strapped to a wire. Our guide, John was brilliant, he reassured those who were nervous and provided help and advice to",
          "This was an awesome experience and for someone whose NOT a fan of heights. I'm glad I did it. Checked that off my bucket list. I did the 2 hour trip and found that was just right for me. Our guide John was great and so were the other two guides (Mark, can't remember the other",
          "By European standards this is pricey but we were keen to do it. Helpful, knowledgeable guide and enjoyable, safe climbing. The course is very straightforward so good for beginners; but groups are mixed so can be slow if you know what you're doing. The suspension bridge was fun!",
          "Great way to spend a day in Banff! Katsu was a wonderful guide on our 2 hour via ferrata. Spectacular views, somewhat challenging for some of our group, none of whom had done anything like this before but what a feeling of accomplishment! Finished off our trip to Mt. Norquay",
          "I booked on this on my last day in Banff and it was fantastic. I was in a group of 9 and our guide Adam made the experience interesting & fun & safe. We were fully kitted up by Emma and she explained what all the equipment was for and then Adam took us through a practice session",
          "My first time using a Groupon and it was well worth the money spent. Katsu our guide was warm and welcoming. He was cheerful and very helpful. It was clear that he really loves his job. My husband and I have never rock climbed before. Despite being physically active people,",

          "Great experience with CMH. Heli-hiking was a unique vacation. Bobby Burns lodge was very nice. The people were fun- guides and guests included. The food was plentiful and excellent. Wonderful vacation. Nature at its best. The snow, the mountain air, the glaciers......amazing.",
          "To start off, I am not the ideal mountain climber. The Via Ferrata was one of the first things we did in Banff. It took us many hours to finally decide to do it, often changing our minds. Despite my intense fear of heights, my wife and I decided to proceed after reading the",

          "I seen a video for it on facebook and knew I had to add it to the summer bucket list. We had 3 couples in our group and there were 2 other people that were paired up with us. Our guides name was Chris and he was really great. We were a pretty quick group so I think we finished",
          "If you have never climbed but have always wanted to try it, this is a great option! But be prepared to be pushed out of your comfort zone! It was exciting and scary at times but it was so much fun. NOTE: If you have trouble with your knees this could be an issue especially on",
          "The 2 hour Via Ferrata was a great introduction to climbing for beginners who are used to an indoor climbing wall. Our guide was fabulous and patient, and the equipment was effective and in great shape. This would be a great family event - we will bring our kids the next time",
          "Had and amazing time, All the staff were very professional. Took the 4 hour tour, would recommend it to any of my friends. be cautious if you don't like heights, was deffinately a good workout but well worth it! Excited to go again!!!",
          "This was by far one of my favorite things I did while in Banff. My friends and I did a walk in on a cool morning at 8:30 when it was snowing on the mountain and our guide Kevin was still enthusiastic to take us for the 4 hr climb. There was fantastic views with lots of time for",

          "Good kit, staff brilliant, climb is taxing but very doable. We saw grizzly bears on the ski lift on the way up.",

          "We completed the 4 hour climb on a wet & cold day. It was safe, fun & just enough of a challenge for a non-climber. They are nicely set up with bad weather & safety gear. The guide was competent & instilled a lot of confidence in us climbers. Bravo for bringing this to Alberta -",
          "My wife and I took this trip for our wedding anniversary over the long weekend and had a great time. My wife was a bit hesitant at first but found the climb very safe and enjoyable. The views are second to none. Special thanks to our guide Adam who was very entertaining and",
          "I have a fear of heights but can tell you that I made it through this with no problems. It looks scary online but the instructors make you feel comfortable and if you can climb a ladder you will have no problems. You will get the hang of it rather quickly, just don't look down",

          "We completed the 4 hour tour yesterday. Via Ferrata gives the beginner climber a chance to climb advanced terrain with Mt Norquay having several exposed rock faces, a suspension bridge and two timber beams on this tour. This was certainly a personal challenge for me and I would",

        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

        "wiki": "The Bow River is a river in Alberta, Canada. It begins within the Canadian Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies, where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river's banks, is considered a part of Calgary's self-image.First Nations made varied use of the river for sustenance before settlers of European origin arrived, such as using its valleys in the buffalo hunt. The name Bow refers to the reeds that grew along its banks and were used by the First Nations to make bows; the Blackfoot language name for the river is Makhabn, meaning \"river where bow reeds grow\".The river is an important source of water for irrigation and drinking water. Between the years 1910 and 1960, the Bow River and its tributaries were engineered to provide hydroelectric power, primarily for Calgary's use. This significantly altered the river's flow and certain ecosystems.\n\n\n== Course ==\n\nThe river's source is from the Bow Glacier, which is part of the Wapta Icefield. The outflow from this source flows into Bow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. It flows south to the village of Lake Louise then turns east and flows through the town of Banff and through Canmore. The Ghost Lake reservoir is formed upstream from the town of Cochrane. The Bow flows eastward to the city of Calgary; it continues on to form the South Saskatchewan River when the Bow joins with the Oldman River near Grassy Lake in southern Alberta. It reaches the Hudson Bay through the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and Nelson River.\nCommunities along the Bow include Lake Louise, Banff, Canmore, Cochrane, Calgary, and Arrowwood. The Bow Falls are on the river's course, near Banff.\nThe Bow River has a total length of 587 km (365 mi) and a drainage area of 26,200 km2 (10,100 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First Nations ===\nThe fur trader James Gaddy and the Hudson's Bay Company explorer David Thompson are traditionally considered to be the first people of European origin to see the Bow River. They camped along the Bow with a group of Piikani during the 1787\u201388 winter. Before they arrived, First Nations populations had lived in the Bow region for thousands of years. Among them were the Nakoda, Tsuu T\u02bcina, and the Blackfoot Confederacy, consisting of the Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika peoples.  The Kutenai had migrated westward, possibly in the early eighteenth century, but still occasionally ventured into the Bow region to hunt bison.First Nations used the river's valleys for the buffalo hunt, in which herds of buffalo were driven over cliffs or into valleys where they could be killed more easily with bows and arrows. Of all the First Nations groups that lived in the Bow River area, only the Nakoda fished the river regularly. While other groups likely caught fish during harder times, they primarily hunted buffalo during the summer season when fishing would have been most plentiful. The river's water naturally attracted game, which the First Nations men also hunted, while women gathered the roots, nuts and berries and processed them for food. The river's game, its local sources for firewood, and its valleys' shelter made the river a common camp location for First Nations during the prairie winters. The danger of crossing the river meant it was a natural boundary for First Nations. The two main fords of the lower Bow River, Blackfoot Crossing and a ford near the Bow's confluence with the Elbow River (where today's central Calgary developed), became important gathering points for First Nations to exchange goods and celebrate festivities. Blackfoot Crossing was used by the Siksika as a winter campsite and is today a part of their reserve.Fur traders began to move to the Bow River region following Thompson's expedition, but the river was not used extensively in the fur trade. First Nations already weakened by declining buffalo numbers and disease were further devastated by the introduction of the whisky trade. Fort Whoop-Up was established in 1869, and whisky traders were active along the Bow River during the 1870s. To stop these operations, the recently formed North-West Mounted Police (later the RCMP) established Fort Calgary in 1875 at the confluence of the Elbow River and the Bow.In order to proceed with railway construction through present-day Alberta and an orderly settlement of the Bow region, the government sought to extinguish title of First Nations to specific lands, and negotiated to do so through treaties. With bison numbers declining and white settlers becoming increasingly common in the region, the Nakoda, Tsuu T\u02bcina, Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika met with representatives of the Canadian government at Blackfoot Crossing on the Bow River and signed Treaty 7 on 22 September 1877, ceding lands in exchange for defined reserves.  From the perspective of the Canadian government, these groups had surrendered all their land privileges outside their reserves. The reserves of the Nakoda, Tsuu T\u02bcina, and Siksika were established along the Bow River.\n\n\n=== Hydroelectric development, 1910\u20131960 ===\nCalgary was growing rapidly after 1900. The city businessmen pressed for dam construction in order to generate cheaper power from hydroelectric sources. William Maxwell Aitken, later with R. B. Bennett, formed Calgary Power Company in 1910. That year, on property purchased from the Nakoda, Calgary Power began constructing Alberta's first major hydroelectric plant, Horseshoe Dam.Calgary Power had problems before this dam was completed in 1911. The Bow River originates from a northern mountain, and its flow varies considerably depending upon the amount and location of winter snowfalls. A comprehensive study of the Bow's flow measurements had not been conducted. In its operations, Calgary Power relied upon estimates of the river's minimum flow during winter conditions. Thus, despite the amount of energy the company had contracted, it could not reliably fulfill these obligations during winters. With capital already invested in Horseshoe, Calgary Power opened another hydroelectric plant and reservoir two years later on the Bow's tributary, Kananaskis River. A reservoir was also created within Banff National Park in 1912 at Lake Minnewanka. Despite this additional reservoir and both plants, Calgary Power still struggled to fulfill its power contracts during winter months. In the 1920s, the company began planning new projects to control the Bow River.\n\nThe Bow River's hydroelectric development both conforms to and contrasts with elements of conservationist ideology in the United States during this era. This ideology espoused that rational and planned resource development guided by technicians should benefit the greatest number of people possible. In this light, rivers could be seen as a series of interdependent parts, and engineering all of them could give technicians control over the system as a whole for the benefit of society.\n\nAdmitting their failure to plan effectively, Calgary Power stated in the  In this process, Calgary Power ultimately fulfilled conservationist ideology as it increasingly brought the Bow River's interdependent sectors, and thus it as a whole, under control, while failing to embody conservationist ideals of rationally developing the Bow initially. Also in line with conservationism, bureaucrats allowing the construction of the Minnewanka reservoir espoused that the nation's development as a whole superseded the need to protect a small part of Banff National Park's nature.Calgary Power's ad hoc hydroelectric development of the Bow continued. Ghost Dam was built in 1929; a major development on the Bow's tributary, Spray River, was completed in 1951; and, at the behest of the provincial government, Bearspaw Dam was built in 1954 just west of Calgary to control flooding (the dam included a generating station). World War II's industrial demand increased pressure on the river: another hydroelectric development was built within Banff National Park, this time on the Cascade River, a tributary of the Bow.Between 1910 and 1960, the Bow River was radically changed as it was systematically engineered to control its water flow and provide hydroelectric power. The seasonal summer flooding in Calgary was an issue of the past. Water was held by reservoirs during spring and summer, permitting steady power generation during fall and winter. Comparing 1924\u201333 to 1954\u201363, the Bow River's January flow had approximately doubled 30 years later. Parts of the river, such as that preceding Ghost Dam, had practically turned into lakes. These developments had ecological effects, too. For example, reservoirs allowed certain fish species, such as the brown trout, to outcompete others, while other species virtually disappeared.\n\n\n=== Environmentalism ===\n\nBy the 1950s, the Bow River's south bank in Calgary was a generally derelict commercial zone. The Calgary Local Council of Women was the most vocal advocate for turning this area into a park system as a part of a broader campaign for improved public and social services. Calgary City Council agreed to the idea in 1955, but by 1959 little progress had been made to fund the project. To accommodate increasing traffic flow through the growing city, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the city began negotiating a CPR reroute that would follow the south bank of the Bow River, turning it into a parkway and the CPR's rail mainline. Among the plan's critics was the Local Council of Women, reminding the city of its 1955 promise for a river park. After negotiations between the CPR and Calgary ended in failure in 1964, urban elites, such as golf clubs, increasingly endorsed the Local Council of Women's idea for a riverfront park system.Park advocates defined the Bow River within Calgary as the city's nature: it was something to be protected for and enjoyed by the public. However, as progress was made in the parks' creation, this \"environmental\" view of the Bow's nature proved selective. For example, trees were not to be cut down, but landscaping to accommodate cyclists was endorsed. In short, the river was valued above all when it suited human goals. Calgary eventually developed an extensive plan for the Bow River's park system, and it is considered an important element of Calgary's self-image today.The grassroots advocacy done by the Local Council of Women denotes emerging environmental sensibilities that are representative of larger trends occurring in North America during this period. Samuel Hays associated such movements with the emergence of an advanced consumer society. Unlike the pre-World War II elitist ideology of conservationist production, this emergent approach in North America was of grassroots consumers democratically engaging in environmental issues, and there was often tension between the public and managers of the environment.After an Alberta Environment official discovered a toxic \"blob\" in the Bow in October 1989, human needs again were given priority. Originating from an abandoned wood-preserving plant on the Bow River's bank, the \"blob\" in the river had released a carcinogenic plume that stretched more than 250 kilometres (160 mi) downstream. Its discovery caused alarm in the media and amongst those living along the Bow River (two years earlier, 70 percent of Calgarians reported using the Bow recreationally).\n\nAs a result, Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, established the Bow River Water Quality Council as a provincial advisory body. The Council was to promote awareness of the river's water quality and try to improve it through fact-finding and aiding inter-institutional coordination. It was composed of representatives from diverse interests such as First Nations, agriculture, and municipalities. Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river's environment. Their attitudes were not strictly human-centric, but, like those favoring a park system in Calgary, they defined the Bow River's environment as something worth preserving for human use.Greater changes in attitude toward the river were manifest in the Bow River Water Quality Council's reports over time. By 1994, the reports emphasized the importance of the Bow's ecological balance as a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park's ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks.\n\n\n=== 2013 floods ===\nIn June 2013, southern Alberta had such heavy rainfall that catastrophic flooding occurred throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities declared local states of emergency on June 20 as water levels rose, and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\n\n==== Designation as a national park ====\nIn 1887 the Canadian parliament, under the urging of the Canadian Pacific Railway vice-president, William Van Horne, and the federal land agent, William Pearce, created Rocky Mountain Park, later to become known as Banff National Park.  Originally 647 square kilometres (250 sq mi), the park was Canada's first national park and included the Bow River. Eventually the park grew to include the Bow Glacier, an outflow of the Wapta Icefield and the source of the Bow River.\nThe designation of Banff as a national park marked a turning point in the public's perception of the Bow River. The river began to be appreciated for its aesthetic value in addition to its industrial and agricultural uses. Officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the company who led the development of Banff, realized this element. When work began on a new luxury hotel in Banff in 1886\u201387, Van Horne personally redesigned and reoriented the plans so that the guests of the hotel would be able to see the vista of the Bow River. Many early postcards from Banff, as well as some current ones, prominently featured the Bow River.\n\n\n==== Sustainability as a national park ====\n\nFrom the 1920s forward, the National Parks of Canada began to focus on the economic benefits of accessible, mass marketable tourism. Changes included new highways and the creation of storage reservoirs for the water needed to sustain the burgeoning community. The Bow River was now seen both for its aesthetic qualities and for new utilitarian aspects.\nBy the 1950s Banff's raw sewage began to be discharged into the Bow River. Because of the self-purification powers of the cold, braided water, however, the Bow was incredibly effective as a natural sewage-treatment facility. Tourists and residents were often unaware of the transformation of the Bow River into a sewage system.\nAs Banff continued to grow, the river continued to digest the increased volume of sewage. This practice, however, began to touch an ideological nerve among the tourists and residents of Banff. Pouring raw sewage into one of the main attractions of the park polluted both the river and, more importantly, the image of Banff. There was also fear that continued reliance on the Bow as a natural sewer would either cap the development of Banff or eventually have great risk to public health. By the 1960s, the town built a modern sewage facility and stopped releasing untreated waters into the Bow. The river's aesthetic qualities had increasing priority in terms of effects of development within the borders of a National Park.\n\n\n== Irrigation and development ==\nThe Bow River supplies the water for three irrigation districts in southern Alberta: the Eastern, Western, and Bow River irrigation districts.\n\n\n=== Eastern Irrigation District ===\nThe Eastern Irrigation District (EID), headquartered in Brooks, Alberta, was originally part of land that the federal government granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in lieu of a portion of the payment for the construction of the railway. In 1929 the CPR split the property into two parts and divested itself of both sections. In 1935 a delegation of irrigation farmers took control of the eastern section and established the EID.The EID, diverting its water at the Bassano and Newell dams, is the largest private land owner in Alberta. Recently the EID began promoting the recreational possibilities that have developed alongside the district's irrigation development. The EID currently owns and operates the Rolling Hills Reservoir Campground.  In 1951, the Province of Alberta also established Kinbrook Island Provincial Park on the eastern bank of the Newell reservoir, which has been stocked with native species of fish.\n\n\n=== Western Irrigation District ===\nThe Western Irrigation District (WID), headquartered in Strathmore, Alberta, was the second half of the land divested by the CPR.  The WID was established in 1944.The water of the WID, diverted at the Calgary Weir, is instrumental to southern Alberta agriculture and, unlike the other two districts, supports the urban needs city of Calgary. It is able to supply both agricultural and urban needs since the WID has higher levels of rainfall than the other two districts, and it receives much of Calgary's storm water.\n\n\n=== Bow River Irrigation District ===\nThe Bow River Irrigation District (BRID), headquartered in Vauxhall, Alberta, was created in 1968, making it the most recent district to be supplied by the Bow.  The BRID diverts the Bow at the Carseland weir and also uses the McGregor, Travers, and Little Bow dams. Each has a reservoir that is also used for recreational purposes.In March 2012, the citizens of the BRID voted in favour of expanding the area of the district by 110 square kilometres (28,000 acres). An expansion of 85 square kilometres (21,000 acres) passed in 2004 as well. This means that, for the second time in eight years, the BRID will increase its demand on the Bow River by roughly 10 percent.\n\n\n=== Irrigation today ===\nOf the 45 crops that are grown in the Bow River basin, only 10 could be produced without irrigation.Because of the dependence of the region on Bow River irrigation water, in the early 21st century all three irrigation districts began to make major changes in order to continue to serve their large mandated areas. In 2006, as a part of the \"Water for Life Initiative\", the Alberta government placed a moratorium on any new licenses for water use from the Bow, Oldman, and South Saskatchewan River basins. The government also requested that the three irrigation districts increase their efficiency by 30 percent.  The irrigation districts are improving their irrigation system by changing most canals to pipelines in order to decrease contamination, spillage, and loss of water to evaporation. A drawback of this change is that trees must be cleared in order to prevent roots from damaging the pipeline, changing the habitat.in 1987 the EID in association with the Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division and Ducks Unlimited Canada established a partnership to create additional wildlife habitat within the Eastern Irrigation District's boundaries.  This demonstrated the EID's goal of encouraging wildlife in order to contribute to the growth of its tourist sector. Hunting and fishing are now promoted on the EID's website.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nThe Bow River provides habitat for wildlife and many opportunities for recreation such as fishing and boating. Both fly fishermen and spinner fishermen share the river in all four seasons of the year. Serious anglers from all over the world visit the Bow River for its thriving population of brown trout and rainbow trout. The Bow River holds a resident population of rainbow and brown trout that has one of the best growth rates to be found on any river system in the world today. A trout that is 4 to 5 years old will be around 53 centimetres (21 in) long, and the Bow River holds many fish that are this size or larger. Mainly the river is fished south of the city of Calgary, past where the water treatment sites dump into the river. The volume of nutrients and number of fish are higher there.\nOutdoor adventurers use primarily three types of boats to enjoy the river, the inflatable boat, the Jon boat and the canoe. There are several spots located on the river to launch watercraft, including Graves Landing, Highway 22X Bridge, Policeman's Flats and McKinnon Flats.\nThe Bow River pathway, is developed on both banks of the river throughout the city of Calgary and is used for cycling, hiking, jogging, as well as rollerblading and skateboarding.\n\n\n=== Recreation and industrial development ===\nThe recreation and tourism sector of the Bow developed closely alongside the river's water irrigation projects. Projects such as the McGregor, Chestermere, and Ghost dams were originally built for either agricultural or electrical purposes but are also important for the recreational facilities they offer. Since their construction, the dams along the Bow River have played a central role in the development of the adjacent communities.\nTwo key examples that demonstrate the connection of recreation and tourism with irrigation are the Chestermere and Basano dams. Following the construction of the Chestermere Dam in 1907, housing developments began to occur around the neighbouring lake and in 1992, because of these developments, Chestermere was declared a town.  Similarity, after a three-year refurbishing project ending in 1987, the town of Bassano, about 8 kilometres (5 mi) northeast of the dam, began advertising the Bassano dam as a tourist attraction for the town. At this point the Bassano dam now also started offering group tours, fishing and picnic areas, and a scenic viewpoint.Communities have also recently begun to appear around Ghost Dam as well.\n\n\n=== Calgary's weir project (Harvie Passage) ===\nIn 1904 the Bow River Weir was constructed close to Calgary's downtown core in order to divert water into the Western Irrigation District.  Since its construction a side effect of the weir had been that it created a circulating wave, with a lethal and powerful undertow,  immediately downstream of it. Because rafting, canoeing, and kayaking down the Bow River are such popular summer activities, there had been many fatalities. Furthermore, because fish were not able to pass through the structure, they too became trapped in the circulating wave and a dense, unnatural concentration of pelicans congregated immediately following the weir.In order to combat the circulating wave and undertow, in August 2007 the Province of Alberta through the Alberta Lottery fund, in conjunction with the Calgary Foundation and the City of Calgary, began construction of the Bow River Weir paddle around, named the Harvie Passage.  The passage allowed for the wave to be dispersed over a set of several smaller rapids while still supplying water to its irrigation district. Altogether, the paddle around cost 18 million dollars and was completed in the spring of 2012.\nIn June 2013, just a year after the project was completed, Calgary was hit with an epic 100 year flood and all of the Harvie Passage work was destroyed. Since that flood, the passage has been closed to the public and a safety boom ahead of the rapids re-installed. Returning flood-ravaged Harvie Passage to its short-lived status as a world-class water playground will cost the province millions and keep it closed until at least 2018. It is estimated that rebuilding the Harvie Passage to the original intent of the project (completed in 2012) would cost an estimated $23.4 million.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nAn invasive species known as Didymosphenia geminata, a type of algae commonly called \"rock snot\", is threatening the stocked exotic invasive brown trout stocks.\n\n\n== Tributaries ==\n\nMany lakes, glacial and artificial are found in the Bow Valley: Bow Lake, Hector Lake, Vermilion Lakes, Gap Lake, Lac des Arcs, and Ghost Lake on the upper course, and a few man-made reservoirs along the lower course.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChristopher Armstrong, Matthew Evenden, and H.V.

        "wiki": "The Fairmont Banff Springs, formerly and commonly known as the Banff Springs Hotel, is a historic hotel located in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The entire town including the hotel, is situated in Banff National Park, a national park managed by Parks Canada. The hotel overlooks a valley towards Mount Rundle, both of which are situated within the Rocky Mountain mountain range. The hotel is located at an altitude of 1,414 metres (4,639 ft).\nThe hotel opened in 1888 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, as one of the earliest of Canada's grand railway hotels. The hotel property has undergone several stages of growth and redevelopment. The original hotel structure was designed by Bruce Price, with another structure completed in 1914. In 1926, a fire destroyed the original structure on the hotel property, although a replacement structure was later completed in 1928. The building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988. The hotel property is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Banff Springs Hotel sits at 405 Spray Avenue near the southern boundary of Banff, a resort town within Banff National Park. The hotel property is bounded by roadways and natural waterways. Two roadways bound the hotel to the north, Bow River Avenue, and Rundle River Avenue, while Spray Avenue bounds the hotel from the west. To the east, the hotel property is bounded by the Spray River. The river serves as a tributary for the Bow River, a waterway north of the hotel property. The hotel property sits near the confluence of the two rivers.\nThe town of Banff is located within the Rocky Mountains mountain range, situated 1,414 metres (4,639 ft) above sea level. The community itself is built around Tunnel Mountain. The hotel property looks over across the valley towards Mount Rundle. Other mountain peaks located near the hotel include Cascade Mountain, Mount Norquay, Stoney Squaw Mountain, and Sulphur Mountain. Given its location within a national park, the hotel is located near a number of attractions and natural landmarks. North of the hotel on the Bow River lies Bow Falls. The Banff Upper Hot Springs is a commercially developed hot spring located south of the hotel.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nBanff Springs Hotel is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by Canadian Pacific Railway. The present hotel property is made up of two main buildings, an eleven-storey tower, and the main block of the hotel. Designed by Walter S. Painter, construction for the tower building, or the centre wing, began in 1911, and was completed in 1914. The main block of the hotel was erected from 1927 to 1928, and replaced the original wooden hotel destroyed in a fire. The original structure was a five-storey wooden building, able to accommodate 280 guests, was designed by Bruce Price. On 24 June 1988, the hotel buildings were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada.\n\nAfter the original wooden structure burnt down in 1926, John W. Orrock, an engineer with Canadian Pacific Railway, was charged with designing its replacement. The replacement building, or the main block, consisted of the north, and south wing. As with the tower added in 1911, the replacement structure is made up of a steel frame, clad in Rundle limestone. Orrock based elements of the new building with the general styles of the original wooden building designed by Price, meaning that the main block also featured elements found on the chateaus of the Loire Valley in France. As a result, the main block features massive wall surfaces, and steep copper roofs, dormers, and gables.The original wooden structure, on which the present north and south wing designs are based, featured architectural elements drawn from Scottish baronial architecture, as well as the chateaus of the Loire Valley. This blend of architectural styles would eventually lead to the Ch\u00e2teauesque style used for most of the grand railway hotels in Canada. Ch\u00e2teauesque features found on the building include its steep pitched roofs, pointed dormers, and corner turrets. However, contrasting later Ch\u00e2teauesque hotels built in Canada, Banff Springs Hotel's also draws elements from the Arts and Crafts movement. Elements from this movement include rounded gables, and rough stone masonry used throughout the building. The remains of the burnt building were removed in 1926, in order to make way for the north and south wings.The centre wing tower was a large limestone structure, influenced largely by Scottish baronial architecture. The building was designed originally as an extension of the original wooden structure.  Unlike the other wings of the hotel, the centre tower featured almost no French medieval architectural elements. Painter's designs had windows that were rounded, flat dormers as opposed to pointed ones, and rounded arches rather than pointed arches seen in French Gothic architecture. The central wing also featured a Renaissance Revival styled arcade before its first floor lounge.\n\nThe interior of the hotel features oak beams, oak panellings and linenfolds, animal carvings, plasterwork of the ceilings, Terrazzo floors, and stained glasswork. Materials found in the interior include fossil-filled carved Tyndall limestone from Garson, Manitoba, and Bedford lime flagstones on the floors of Mount Stephen Hall, an event room within the hotel.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe Banff Springs Hotel includes 757 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel property. The hotel property also houses a number of event spaces, used for conferences, weddings, and other social events. Event spaces within the hotel building include the Alberta Dining Room, the Alhambra Dining Room, the Cascade Ballroom, Mount Stephen Hall, and the Riverview Walk. Given its location, the hotel property also features outdoor event spaces, including a terrace garden.\n\nA number of areas within the hotel property are also occupied by restaurants, or other food-based services. As of December 2017, twelve restaurants operate within the hotel property. Restaurants located within the hotel include 1888 Chop House, the Samurai Sushi Bar, the Waldhaus, and the Rundle Lounge. The latter restaurant also hosts the hotel's afternoon tea. The hotel also hosts a locally sourced market, Stock Food & Drinks. Other facilities located on the hotel property include a bowling alley, five turf-topped tennis courts, a swimming pool, and a 27-hole golf course designed by golf course architect Stanley Thompson. Spa facilities were opened at the hotel in 1991.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original building was shaped as an H and included an octagonal centre hall, with an additional wing extending from its towards the Bow River. The building was clad in shingles with stone accents. Tiered verandahs were situated at the end each wing. The 1888 structure cost $250,000 and a mistake made by the builder changed the intended orientation of the building, turning its back on the mountain vista. This building included more than 100 bedrooms, centered on a five-story, octagonal rotunda. An addition in 1902 expanded and renovated the building, adding more than 200 rooms.By 1906, plans were advanced for a complete overhaul of the Banff Springs Hotel building, proposing a replacement of much of the original structure. Walter Painter, chief architect for Canadian Pacific Railway, designed an eleven-story central tower in concrete and stone, flanked by two wings. This time correctly oriented to the dramatic view, the so-called \"Painter Tower\" was completed in 1914 at the cost of $2 million with 300 guest rooms and, for some time, became the tallest building in Canada. Construction of new wings was delayed by World War I, and the surviving Price wings continued in service.\nThe hotel was named for William Davidson, who had grown up in Moray, close to Banff, Scotland, and was the first European settler in that area of Canada. The name borne by the Canadian city and the national park is derived from his native country. Halfway up the internal staircase closest to the Bow Falls is found a painting of Davidson felling trees on the Miramichi River during colonial times.  The painting of the pioneer is by the war artist Cyrus Cuneo (1879\u20131916), who executed a series of paintings for the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nFurther renovations designed by architect, J. W. Orrock, who continued in style originated by Painter, significantly expanding the Painter Tower, altering its roofline, and adding his substantial additions. In 1926, while work was proceeding on the new wings, a fire destroyed the remainder of the original building designed by Price. The two new wings completed and opened in 1928.\n\nThe Monarch of Canada, King George VI, and Queen Elizabeth visited the hotel during their 1939 royal tour of Canada. From 1942 to 1945, the hotel was shut down in an effort to free up labour for the war effort.In 1968, the building underwent a process of winterization, allowing for the hotel to operate year-round. The hotel went through several renovations during the latter half of the 20th century, including one in 1971, and another in preparation for the 1988 Winter Olympics.In 2001, Canadian Pacific Hotels, the hotel division of Canadian Pacific Railway, was reorganized as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. The hotel's name was changed to the Fairmont Banff Springs as a part of this re-branding effort. In 2006, seven Fairmont hotels, including Banff Springs sold to Oxford Properties, a company owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts continues to manage the resort following the sale of the hotel property.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Canadian railway hotels\nList of hotels in Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRobinson, Bart (2007).

          "Attended during the summer holidays in August and sad to say the reviews are true. The area is beautiful, the springs are gorgeous and warm however, it was just like sitting in warm water with 100 people. Worth a visit, if you know it will not be busy.",
          "Loved the time in the spa as always, what I liked about this place was the explanation of how it all happens on a giant display before you go in the water. Half the patio wan closed because it gets icy. Very understandable but good to know.",
          "It was a wonderful activity during a short trip with bad weather and reduced visibility. It reminded me a lot of the geothermal pools in Iceland. I did wish they had a bar or something, as the only option is sitting or sitting. I feel like there were some open spaces that",
          "We just visited here last week and I think we were quite lucky with how quiet it was! I was a bit concerned by some of the reviews, but we timed it well in the middle of the day I think. It is just a warm swimming pool essentially - but if you want fancy hot springs you\u2019ll",
          "Not a pretty natural hot spring but worth a visit if you get time. The pool is very hot! Staff are somewhat rude, but lovely views of surrounding mountains",
          "Love coming here to just relax! Perfect way to relax after all the walking around or even after skiing/snowboarding!",
          "This was beautiful, nice hot springs with snow all around and beautiful snow covered mountains. Large dressing room. It was a nice peaceful experience.",
          "Yes it's busy and crowded, but for good reason! Enjoy and relax in the historic and relaxing surroundings, especially nice after a day of skiing.",
          "We go to the hot springs often so know it can get busy and today was pretty crazy. The biggest issue is parking and organization of both the gondola and the springs. Oddly there was a parking attendant at the gondola but the springs parking lot had no attendant and tons of",
          "This looks nothing like advertised! It is in a neat location and the exterior looks good but it is basically an outdoor heated YMCA pool that is overcrowded and not very relaxing! We walked in and walked right out. Save your money!",
          "Love coming here when the weather starts cooling down, it is usually very busy but if you're comfortable with crowds it's a great post-hike or post-shopping activity to ease sore feet and relax with a beautiful mountain view. Sometimes the water temperature can fluctuate quite a",
          "We've enjoyed geothermal pools in Iceland like Hrunalaug etc this was quite different. Apart from having to wear clothes ,and they hire out \"historical\" swimming clothes if you haven't brought your own ,it's busy . But it was nice with the snow falling and just enjoying the",
          "A must do! My husband and I had never been to a hot springs before. The view was spectacular. And it was beyond amazing to look out at the snowy mountaintops while lounging in 40 degree water.",
          "These were okay, however I would recommend going at night/evening as during the day they are very very full!",
          "Went to the springs with the in laws today. It wasnt busy when we went so that was great. The change rooms were nice and clean. The staff was very polite.",
          "Who.e staying at Banff for a ski trip I did visit the hot springs and was not disappointed. The facility is very clean the spring water was hot and felt great after a hard day of skiing. It was easily accessible by public transportation. If you forget to pack a bathing suit, no",
          "We went up the the Hot Springs, took a look at the mass of people sitting in your average large pool and didn\u2019t bother. We thought it would be more rustic, the pool. I guess if you don\u2019t have access to a hot tub or pool, it would be great, but our hotel had a great hot tub, so",
          "Great place to lie back in the warm water and marvel at the beautiful scenery around. Mountain views were great. The water was clean, and artificial, so not really a hot spring at all, but worth it for the view.",
          "Marketed as hot springs (which it once was ) however feels like a large heated and chlorinated pool full of people .... I think some of the hotels have better offerings",
          "Wow what an experience to be sitting in hot pools on a mountain surrounded by snow. This was a magical experience for us as we come from a warm climate. The scenery was breathtaking sitting in a pool then getting out in -20c . Definitely worth a visit here we were going to go",
          "Some people think Hot springs are overdone in this area, but this is worth the 8$. Bring your own towel, blowdryer (if needed), flip flops, and moisturizer for after. A must after a long day of outdoor activity- winter orvaummer!",
          "We really enjoyed the Banff upper hit springs ! It was nice to relax in the hot springs after busy days of snowboarding. It is actually very cheap to visit as well! Really impressed with the lay out",
          "One of my favourite winter activities! We go to Banff in January every year, to celebrate winter in the dead of it, mostly because (while I hate public pools) I loooove the hot springs and it\u2019s my birthday. We\u2019ve been in all sorts of cold weather (would not be my thing in",
          "The water was deliciously warm on a snowy day and the price is right but the whole experience could be better. There is a system in place with a token given at entry to gain access to some lockers. This wasn\u2019t explained and resulted in a trip back to the front desk which was",
          "It's so nice to sit in the hot springs in the middle of winter overlooking the mountains I'm such a beautiful day with the sun shining. If you're going to Banff you got to check out the upper hot springs bring your bathing suit plan to spend a couple hours soaking in the hot",
          "We went to the hot springs twice on this visit to Banff, our hotel pool & spa were closed for maintenance so they were giving their guests complementary tickets to use at the springs. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting relaxing in the hot water with the beautiful views of the snow",
          "If you have experience Hot Spring in Japan, you will be vy disappointed for this so called \"hot spring\". I can only call it as a big bath tub. During Christmas, we couldn't find a parking lot and gave up. We try again today but still have a long queue. When I enter to the",
          "The \u201chot spring\u201d is more like a giant pool with hot water. The water supposedly comes from a source on the mountain (sulfur mountain) but is chlorinated and temperature controlled to 98*F. 3 stars for the views. This is a giant hot tub with a Million people than a hot spring.",
          "This was the perfect end to a busy day! Would definitely recommend the visit if you haven't been, and you can also take the bus up from downtown Banff as it was fairly busy up there. That would be the only downside is that there are a lot of people during the holidays, but still",
          "If you don't time it right, this is one of those experiences that seems better than it really is. We drove to the hot springs at about 7p after an early dinner, hoping the apres ski crowd would be leaving for dinner. After the challenge of finding parking, we walked up the hill",
          "We walked here from our hotel and this was nice to sit in the warm water and look at the great views. They have a nice changing facility and a small cafe there. We took our own suits and rented towels and lockers. The water is warm it's only advised to stay in for 10-20",
          "A place to relax after a day on the trails. The 102 degrees water is a refreshing way to end the day or night. Its open until 10pm. They have towels to rent for $1.09 and locker looks for shower and changing. Recommended!",
          "It was great snow all over the mountains and sitting in hot water was really relaxing. If you go banff make sure stop by at hot springs.",
          "We booked a ski trip with Ski Big 3 and it included a free visit to the upper hot springs. They were worth the visit. The water was very soothing after a long day of skiing. It is communal, but was clean enough. Showers were fine, towels and swimsuits can be rented if you",
          "The atmosphere was fun. Friendly people. The water was super hot but the air was so cold with a slight drizzle of rain. There was a ledge on the side with bubbles jetting out which gave an incredible back massage. You could hire period bathing costumes too. A great experience!",
          "Like many other travelers, after the Gondola Ride and hiking in the snw at the top, it was a blessing to dip in the hot water, when it was -22 Celsius outside. The desk offered everything you need, from swim suits to towels. Entrance fee was really convenient, the lockers were",

          "We visited the hot springs after a day at Sulphur Mountain around 4pm. Clearly, everyone else had the same idea too! There is only one pool, so when it is busy it can get a little cramped. That said, the water felt great at 39C and we were able to find some space on the edge to",
          "I never miss a visit to the Upper Hot Springs. It's a clean facility that offers swim suit rentals. Must do!",
          "This is a gem in the mountains. Therapeutic experience Planning to go back. A must to visit. Great service.",
          "Banff Springs is very lovely, however we found it quite crowed and noisy. However this is a tourist town and the views and sites are well worth it.",
          "This place is nice summer or winter and we've had enjoyable swims there in each and every season. It's fun when it's really cold, and people get snow accumulations on their head. But when we were they recently, the weather was cool but clear. The water was a good temperature,",
          "We\u2019ve going regularly for a # of years ( in fact have a season pass... a great deal for a local as are we) Worthwhile to bring your own towel as those provided are small, bathing suit dryers close to exit are great. In summers deck chairs a treat",
          "As we stayed at the Rimrock we were just across the road and after a long afternoon hike decided to recoup with a dip. The prices are great as for about$10 each you get a towel, locker and access to the pool. The water is inviting as you step out of the building out into the",
          "Having bathed in the amazing Blue Lagoon springs in Iceland last year we were really looking forward to these hot springs in the mountains. We did not expect a fairly boring swimming pool with hot water. No atmosphere and no views from the pool itself we were all very",
          "If you don't mind feeling like one of the herd, then you might enjoy this attraction. It was so crowded that we couldn't enjoy ourselves fo worry of bumping into someone at every turn. Nice place but way too crowded.",
          "Going to the springs while it was snowing was such a great experience. So warm and just feeling the snow. First time at the springs during while it snows.",
          "Banff Upper Hot Springs was a welcomed change to how we spent the rest of our time in Banff. We were there in the early afternoon of a weekday, it wasn\u2019t crowded at all. I feel off-season is definitely the time to be in Banff. We really enjoyed soaking and taking in the",
          "I don't know why this place has good reviews but this is a waste of time and money. We were so excited to get here and 'soak' our tiredness away for an hour or more. We got there and there were A LOT of people. There was only 1 pool for everyone to dip in and it was almost",
          "A very good hot spring overlooking the mountains..The temperature is perfect for a cold weather..I saw some kids on the hot spring too,but my daughter couldn\u2019t take the hot temperature,she can stay for few minutes and come out again..Showers ,washrooms,and changing area are",
          "Well can I tell you after a day of sightseeing this is we\u2019re you need to stop. For about $10.25 to go in. Worth the trip. Amazing view if mountain.",
          "We had a late night and decided to put on the swimsuits and head to the hot springs. The place is open until 10 PM. We arrived at 9:25PM, they do not let anyone in after 9:30 PM. The water was hot without any smell. Very relaxing to sit in the pool. Lots of swimmers even in the",
          "Perfect ime at the Springs to relax before exploring the lakes and Banff National Park. The staff was very friendly and it was beautiful to enjoy the hot water while lookig the snowed mountains. Perfect and very well priced.",
          "We walked over here from the Gondola having had the morning up there and we had an hour in here at around 2pm. It was fantastic and so relaxing .....to be lovely and warm (39degrees in the water) yet be in the open air up the mountains! The landscape views were amazing . The",
          "It was so inviting. You feel invigorated. It\u2019s the best feeling ever. The staff was wonderful and helpful. The place was very clean and had a great time soaking in the Hot Springs. This is a must and it\u2019s right next to Banff Gondola. You will certainly enjoy this relaxation.",
          "My husband and I were looking forward to getting In the hot springs. It was on our must do list. But upon seeing the \u201cpool\u201d and the hundreds of people in it, we decided to forgo this adventure. We expected it to be in the mountains and to feel more like being in nature, not at",
          "Alberta and British Columbia have a number of hot springs that are used extensively by Canadians and tourists. A session in a hot springs seems to be a birthright! The water temperature was 102 the day we were there. You meet all types of people while you relax in the mineral",
          "It was a great way to take a hot spa bath with a spectacular mountain view! The water was so warm and soothing as we looked at Sulphur Mountain. Every 10 minutes or so, we would get out of the water and sit on the edge of the pool in the cool air before getting back in the",
          "We went on a misty mountain day, but it was still pleasant to hang out and enjoy the thermal springs.",
          "Visited on Saturday night over the long weekend and it was really busy standing room only. Still a great experience and must do when you are in Banff. Great to sit both people watching and star gazing in really warm and steaming pool. Not bad value for money either. Only",
          "This was such a fantastic experience. The whole space was clean, and the scenery was to die for. We were able to rent bathing suits and towels. I was hesitant because of some negative reviews, but if you can manage to avoid the crowds, you'll love it as much as we did.",
          "Wife and I stopped at the Hot Springs after a long day Hiking and it was most enjoyable. The Spring is definitely hot and soothe the aches away, it is however very busy. The restaurant for a drink and eats afterwards was however a disappointment, its overpriced and the staff",
          "Not the biggest mineral springs you will ever experience but a nice activity in pleasant mountain surroundings. Towels and swimwear provided if you don\u2019t have your own.",
          "Great value to enjoy hot springs. You can just walk in unprepared. Towel, swimming suit, locker with a small fee.",
          "Nice treat! The water is lovely and warm, it is actually quite peaceful when in the pool. Unfortunately, it was drizzly and cloudy the day we went so the views were not spectacular but I can imagine that on a clear day it would be amazing to bathe in the warm waters",
          "this place has been around for over a hundred years. Not expensive to visit. Facilities in good shape, pool very warm and clean. Great views.",
          "Just a short 10 minute walk from the gondala (free shuttle from the Elk + Avenue hotel) this should be done to round off the Banff experience. Lockers provided in the changing rooms with a single use token. Bathing area itself is quite small, says it can hold 205 people but I",
          "The Hot Springs in Banff are fantastic! The water was 102degrees in the day we visited. However with the air temperature in the 40s it was perfect! Relaxing and exhilarating! If you are in Banff, you must go!",
          "We visited on a snowy day when lots of people had flocked to the hot springs. In spite of its business, the changing rooms were not cramped and ample lockers available. Pool has a capacity of 200 and I reckon there were 150 in that day. I wouldn't want to visit with 200. Cafe is",
          "Go for a soak - any time of the year - Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter. I some ways winter is best - outdoor pool - awesome views - the best - snow falling / cold outside but you are happy and warm in the hot spring.",
          "39 degree water lovely clean facilities. Reasonably priced. Can hire towels. Give it a try especially if you have walked up from town or holed sulphur mountain",
          "We had high hopes for the \"hot springs\" but in reality the springs are nothing more than a large overcrowded bath. The changing rooms were dirty and tired, and very much in need of some attention. We would not recommend visiting.",
          "We went to the springs at about 11am on a Monday morning. They were almost empty (perhaps 20 other users) and very clean. We stayed about an hour. The pool and changing facilities were very clean, and there were plenty of staff and lifeguards around to answer questions or offer",
          "Located just below the Banff Gondola, these hot springs are the perfect antidote to a day spent too much or a whole bunch of nothing. The setting overlooks Banff and the surrounding Rockies. They've made it very easy to buy your pass, get a locker, and step into the springs.",
          "I visited the Banff Upper Hot Springs in early August 2019 and it was a wonderful way to spend my last day in Banff. The hot springs are located in the town of Banff, next to Sulphur Mountain. I arrived when they opened at 9 AM and was one of the first people there. It became",
          "Towels and bathing costumes available for rent, if you wish to squeeze yourself into this popular bath. Otherwise, you can enjoy the splendid view form the top for free.",
          "Great for a brief visit but dont expect to spend hours here. The recommended time in the pool before a break is 10 minutes and you would only want a few dips, not because it's too hot (!) but because if it's as busy as it was on our visit, it was very loud & not overly relaxing.",
          "My husband and I visited mid September and we were slightly disappointed. I would class it as an outdoor heated pool instead of hot springs, and it was quite busy when we went (despite it being a Wednesday outside of school hols). The changing rooms were clean though which was",
          "For approx $10 you can sit in 37/39*C of hot steaming water while looking out on stunning views of the surrounding Rockies...! I loved it and went back the following day.. open until late at night 10/11pm too!",
          "When I booked the hot springs, I was under the impression that there were natural hot pools in addition to swimming pools. The hot spring is in fact just like a communal bath- a big tiled pool with hot spring water. It was very crowded and there were lots of children in there",
          "This is not a hot spring it\u2019s a giant disgusting hot tub with disgusting change rooms and shower area and yeah probably don\u2019t go unless you enjoy sitting in other people\u2019s pee. And I\u2019m from transcona.",
          "This is a wonderful way to relax and if you forgot your swimsuit they have very cute vintage suits to rent. The water is such a perfect temperature and very restorative. The best part is talking to others in the pool and learning about them and I offered many suggestions to a",
          "For the price, this is a no brainer. Amazing thermal springs, soak as long as you like. Very reasonable, but the nickel/dime thing w/ towel rental is kinda silly. When visiting the area, you\u2019re most always in a hotel, so bring your own hotel towel and save a couple bucks. Fine",
          "Runs like a traditional municipal baths from the last century. Communal changing rooms, coin operated lockers, slightly dodgy showers. However, the water is very warm and relaxing and the view is lovely. Quieter in the morning.",
          "Taking a hot bath with a lot of like minded adults. The showers worked. The lockers locked the water was hot and soothing. The rental bathing costumes looked like they came from the 20's so glad I bought my own. Take your own towel as well.",
          "You can take a shuttle bus to the springs from town which is a short but steep ride? Car parking can be a problem at times as the springs adjoin the start of a popular hiking trail. We opted therefore for an early visit with the springs open from 9am daily. For us this worked",
          "I really like the lifeguard @ hotspring and very good and I liked it so much thanks for me I would recommend to anyone sinercerly Michelle arklie",
          "You were excited to try this Hot Springs location, had done some in other states. It was nice to try, but more like just hanging out in a swimming pool.",
          "We visited the springs on a cold rainy September day and what a highlight it was! The water was very warm and the changing facilities were very clean. There was a life guard on hand the whole time. Take care not to stay in the warm water for too long without a break. Definitely",
          "Nothing natural about it, just looks like a swimming pool. Seats don\u2019t face the mountains. Cheap to go in but would prioritise going elsewhere if short on time",
          "Why sit in a concrete pool of hot water with scads of people you don't know? It smells like sulfur and I'm sure it is filtered and chlorinated. The crisp mountain air and the views in this area should be enough to mellow one out. Or just sit in a tub at your hotel with a",
          "Spent some time here today, fortunately there weren\u2019t too many people.outside temp was around 5 degrees water temp around 39degrees C ,you only need an hr for the whole experience, we all enjoyed it\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Worthwhile. Bring your own bathing suit. We brought towels from the hotel rented lockers. Walk down to the Rimrock hotel after and have a drink in there beautiful lobby bar. Talk about Mellow!",
          "Pool water was hot! Pretty busy in the pool but still plenty of room for everyone. Nice way to finish off a hard day hiking.",
          "Somehow I was expecting more than just a large pool but that\u2019s what you get. A large hot pool with lots of people and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m sure when the weather is good it\u2019s probably worth it for the views but on a rainy day it seemed like it wasn\u2019t really worth going.",
          "My boyfriend and I went around 10 in the morning on a cooler, overcast day. It was a great choice. The prices are great (about $8/person). The views from the pool are also beautiful, since it's in the middle of several mountains. They also have bathing suit and towel rentals if",
          "Excellent facilities, beautiful view and hot spring water. Good value. Can be a bit crowded at peak hours.",
          "Ok ok, So I was in charge of planning our trip to Banff and the hot springs came up in so many conversations. Everytime I said nope, were not going. I just thought they were over-rated. And to be honest they are. It's a small pool, fed by a spring I suppose. It was 8.50 per",
          "As others have said, it is basically a big hot tub. But the views are great and it is a nice way to relax after a day of hiking. We were lucky that it wasn't that busy. Parking is free but don't forget to display your Park Pass (as we did). The Park employees rectified the",
          "Was a little disappointed with this. It amounts to an outdoor heated pool and feels just like that and cannot tell the difference whether it had all the natural spring minerals etc. Still not a bad hour to lie and relax after a trek. Value for money it is.",
          "I'm wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this so basically 3.5 stars. It's essentially an outdoor heated pool in the mountains about 4km above Banff. You don't really get the feel that it's a 'hot spring' as such but maybe I've been spoiled by too many natural hot springs",
          "The place is 4 kms south of Banff town.Located at the upper most part of famous sulphur mountain, the hot springs has modern amenities and a distinctive architecture. popular attraction for the soothing and healing properties of the mineral rich springs. The year-round authentic",
          "This place thrives on its heritage and location. Unfortunately it takes in way more people than it can handle and the result is that you end up feeling like you are sitting on a crowded bus with no space to move, let alone sit sometimes. Would give it only one star, but it",
          "So this wasn\u2019t that much different than the hot tub at my resort except for two major things...much less (if there is any chlorine) and the views. The views can\u2019t be beat, no matter where you sit in the pool you\u2019re looking at mountains. It\u2019s worth doing at least once during",
          "Ive enjoyed going to the hot springs both in winter and summer. I'd recommend arriving early or later in the day if possible as it does get quite crowded and the wait can be relatively long. My personal preference is a winter visit if possible, as it offers the perfect",
          "Crazy busy. Bring a towel or you must pay for one. Open bay showers. Locker comes with entry. Pool is small but relaxing.",
          "It was cold and raining - perfect weather for the hot mineral springs, right? Sort of...they were open to guests, but 5 minutes in, they evacuated everyone due to an incoming thunderstorm. (I ABSOLUTELY appreciated their attention to safety). Whilst sitting around waiting for",
          "We visited on a very warm afternoon. Probably not the best idea , as the temperature was pretty much the same in or out of the water. Clean. Lockers , shower gel provided. Take flip flops Parking very limited, so use public transport or as we did the hotel shuttle. We rented",
          "We stayed at Rimrock which is only a few hundred yards away. We walked up the hill to check it out. It\u2019s basically a heated pool, made to hold about 50 people, but with 150+ allowed in it. Sure it\u2019s cheap; it should be. We passed.",
          "Really warm hot springs, nice scenery all around, completely worth a visit. A bit hidden away, but finding it is quite easy.",
          "This is the worst hot spring I have ever been to. It's basically an outdoor heated pool, crammed to bursting with people. The only good thing about it is the cheap price. If I were you, I'd give it a miss.",
          "We enjoyed bathing in the hot spring and this facility was pretty good. The price was very cheap as well ($8.30) You can bring your own towel or rent it for $1.90. The temperature was good and if you look carefully, you will find a jet to massage your back. My only complaint",
          "We arrived early and had a really pleasant time there It was clean and reasonably priced When we were leaving it was getting very busy and apparently the pool can hold up to 200 people which seems a lot for its size My advice is go early",
          "Yes, it is crowded and the pool is not very big, but it was still a pleasant experience at the end of a busy day. The facility is nice, is entirely handicapped accessible, and at about eight dollars including locker, it\u2019s a bargain.",
          "This does not compare well to other hot springs I have been to. It is only one semi-large warm pool. It does stay open until 11pm, but there were families with teenagers and young children there well past 10pm. I figured it would get quiet later in the evening, but it was",
          "I had seen a leaflet about this and it lead me to believe it was more of a natural pool in the moutain but when i got there it was just a swimming pool with warm water which was majorly overcrowded. The only good thing was the view.",
          "I was informed that someone \u201cpooped\u201d in the pool right after I got changed and was ready to go to the pool. The staff advised me to change back since it would take a while for the pool to be cleaned up, and I could get refund at the ticket desk. The staff at the ticket desk",
          "We always enjoy hot springs whenever we can. It\u2019s a little drive from the town but not too far out. The building, showers, and change rooms are very standard. I was a like shocked at how small the actual pool was. We went in the evening and it was very busy. It took us quite a",
          "The Banff Upper Hot Springs has quite a lot going for it; it's very close to the town, it is extremely affordable, it is well run and it has a great view. It is not, however, a traditional hot springs experience. You can expect to take a dip in a medium sized, hot pool with",
          "People are correct to say that this is not a real hot spring but it is affordable and the view is spectacular so why not. If you don't have any bathing suit or towels, no worries, they rent those items as well at a very reasonable price. I am quite certain that during colder",
          "Great value for money and got there early, which helped. There with two children under 7 and they loved it. Hot springs on a cold and wet day - perfect. Well organised and friendly staff. All the aches, pains and tiredness simply fade away as the bathe in the waters. A touch",
          "The springs consists of a single pool that is out in the open. The water was pleasant enough but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a destination in itself although that probably changes if it is winter. Staff at the entrance were extremely pleasant.",
          "This was a huge let down. We\u2019ve been to natural hot springs in Colorado, so we assumed that this would be similar. When we walked up to the building, I thought maybe there was a pool separate from the springs. Nope! Those are the springs. It\u2019s a man made pool with the springs",
          "Great way to spend an hour or so after a big hike. Bring your own towel to save some money and don\u2019t forget sunglasses if it\u2019s a bright day.",
          "We\u2019ve been to hot springs all over the world and this wasn\u2019t necessarily the nicest or most elaborate attraction. But, it was clean, the view was spectacular and the price was right. It was about $8 per adult, and another $2 for a towel rental. Each person gets a locker and full",
          "We went as a family of four and all enjoyed the hotsprings. It was busy for sure, but people filter in and out constantly so we quickly found seats around the edge. We stayed for about an hour. The view is stunning and it was a very affordable activity for a family. They",
          "We went to enjoy a cloudy, not-so-warm evening at the hot springs. Thunder storms were forecasted but we thought we\u2019d take a chance. The hot springs were very busy but we were all kicked out as the lightning and thunder started. The facilities were nice tho. Definitely older,",
          "Where do I start, the name Hot Springs is completely misleading. A swimming pool filled with hot spring water maybe. Me and my wife have been to a few springs / thermal pools across the world and they were an authentic hot spring. If you want authenticity, then I would advise",
          "We arrived and soon realised that what was titled a \u2018hot spring\u2019 was really just a rammed outdoor swimming pool. Just head to your local baths instead!",
          "If you can manage to get into Banff National Park, and find a parking spot, the Hot Springs are worth a stop. We came in after 7pm to avoid the crazy traffic of this area, and ensure we could find a place to park! For less than 10$ you can enjoy a soak in these natural hot",
          "We brought our 11 and 13 year old kids here after 4 days of hiking. We went around 10:00 am and it wasn't very crowded. Our family paid about $25, which included lockers. My husband and I enjoyed our 30-minute soak, as it's essentially a pool-sized hot tub, but the kids would",
          "We visited the Hot Springs on a rainy day in early July... along with half of Banff, ha ha. Everyone seemed to have the same idea so the queue was quite long but moved quite quickly. The water is lovely and hot, like being in a jacuzzi and it was a great experience being in",
          "Beautiful views while soaking in this hot spring pool. It was a little crowded but was a nice end to a long day of hiking. They offered towels for a small charge as well as vintage style swimsuits. Which would be fun for a family photo. Make sure to ask the etiquette for the",
          "The water is nice, the view is nice, and it's inexpensive, but that's about it. It's a small pool with A LOT of people. The pool, the facility and the parking lot are just not made for that many people. The locker room was dirty, understandable, it would be hard to keep up.",
          "It's a small pool but we were lucky as wasn't crowded. The views are lovely and we relaxed in the pool for over an hour. Such a delight to see the snow whilst swimming. A very cheap place to experience. Only $7 and you can hire a towel and locker.",
          "Good value for money. Locker for valuables included in the price for an extra a dollar or two you get a towel as well. Nice views and super way to relax soaking in 40 degree water.",
          "I\u2019m just not one for public bathing I guess. I\u2019m with a previous reviewer whose wrote \u201cmeh\u201d. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very very crowded so if you\u2019re at all claustrophobic you\u2019ll hate it! Plus there\u2019s a no shoes rule in the locker room. Um, gross? Maybe I\u2019m overly paranoid about foot",
          "Don't understand some of these reviews. If you don't like crowds then don't go to popular public places. The pool is great. The price is fantastic and the scenery is breathtaking. And for all of those negative reviewers - stay home if you don't like meeting new people. My wife",
          "Situated just down the road from the Banff Gondola there is very little 'natural' about these baths.In fairness not expensive but can get very crowded.",
          "Not worth the trip. We thought the parking areas were massive and expected the size of the hot spring pool(s) to match. We joined the massive line for tickets extending to outside the building and saw the size of the pool, so packed with standing people that there was no space",
          "Having visited the hot springs in Banff many years ago I was a bit disappointed with this visit. This time the (extensively renovated) pool was much like any other swimming pool only hotter and it smelt of chlorine rather than the sulphurous smell usually associated with hot",
          "Nothing spectacular about this place. Basically an overcrowded hot pool. The staff doesn\u2019t seem to care too much about onlookers above harassing people in the pool",
          "The springs were very relaxing with great views from the pool. Its not a large spring with one major pool, which can get quite crowded at peak times - however its well worth a visit especially if combined with the Gondola which is just next door.",
          "We went at 9 pm and it was pretty busy. I considered turning around but once you are inside it is worth the visit. You can rent old fashioned bathing suits which makes for fun pictures ! The change rooms were moderately clean. There was an attendant cleaning constantly but what",
          "Like many visors to Banff, we decided to visit the hot springs. I called ahead and spoke with the manager and they recommend arriving between 9:00 - 11:00 AM daily because after that the parking lot is packed and so is the pool. We arrived early and stayed for approximately 90",
          "The hot springs are located beside the Banff gondola station, and worth visiting if you are in the area. We were expecting something a bit more spectacular, a la the blue lagoon on a smaller scale, but this is more like a very warm swimming pool, with mineral rich water. Was",
          "We had thought this would be hot springs with organically created spring to sit in... unfortunately, most of our teenagers felt it was a glorified pool. A few of us with young children enjoyed it for a short 30 minute visit, but our teenagers were not interested. At the price,",
          "We went at 9 pm to see the sun begin to set. It was light out until after 10 pm which made for beautiful views. The hot spring pool was very relaxing and the kids favourite part of their day.",
          "Came on a rainy day in July, crowded, but it felt amazing after camping in the rain for several days. The water was 40degC. The old fashion bathing suits that are for rent are awesome. We are thinking of renting them just for the family photo. Unlike the Radium Hot Springs,",
          "Beautiful walk up to the off trail area. We were unable to finish the loop in the canyon due to rain and mud, but very much enjoyed what we were able to do. You can do this hike in tennis shoes on a nice day, but I would recommend hiking boots for a wet day. Once you leave the",
          "We went up to the Hot Springs thinking it was going to be a bit bigger and maybe a little bit more in the \u201cnatural surroundings\u201d, but it was on the smaller size and seemed like just a swimming pool/hot tub. The water temperature was perfect-about 104, but there is only one pool",
          "Nice place to come after a couple of days on long mountain trails. Everything that you might need is available to hire at a small cost.",
          "This was a wonderful stop after we came back from the Gondola ride. The place was affordable and clean, it was very busy but that is to be expected. Don't expect a natural rock spring, it's more like a swimming pool, but it is very relaxing and has beautiful views. Will be",
          "The wife and I rode city bus from downtown Banff to the hot springs up on the mountain. A long line to get in, but the clerk was friendly, efficient, quick to process the visitors. 6:00 PM was evidently the peak time to visit. The concrete pool was very large and could",

          "The Banff Upper hot springs is a large hot tub. You do get an ok view of the gondola, and surrounding mountains. The water temp is 104F. Adult admission includes a locker rental. They have towel and swim suit rentals. There are showers and swim suit spin dryers. We were",
          "If you were looking for basically a slightly warmer-than-usual conventional pool filled with 50 jostling tourists-turned-bathers to relax after a full day of touristic activities, then you've come to the right place. If you were coming, expecting that you would find an exotic",
          "After a hike, decided to get a little soak in. They were working on the parking lot. Signage was mediocre at best. Had to park along one side of the road (no forewarning). Going through the line was the speed of molasses, but the person behind the counter was polite. Locker",
          "It's a pool, not a very nice or big one. The day we stopped by the pool was so crowded there was no space to sit along the edge. Might as well just go to a heated pool. Cafeteria was very low end.",
          "Near the Gondola station, there is a large carpark that services the Springs as well. It is a short walk to the Springs with the last bit up a short hill. Some people also walk up from Banff town or catch the local bus. You enter the old premises, paying for your entry and any",
          "After a trip up the gondola and getting quite chilled we took the short walk from the base gondola station to these hot springs. Watch out for all the road construction going on right now. We paid to rent towels as it saved carrying our own throughout the day. The towels and",

          "Busy for a reason. Hot springs are great. Especially after a long day on the trail. Line up to get in was long and slow :( facilities pretty clean despite the mass number of people. Staff friendly :)",
          "The spring feed was a decent experience that did invigroate us. The cost was decent and the views were great.",
          "Enjoyable experience in spring fed pools; not overly priced for the experience, free shuttle available from the town, with a short walk to the entrance. Changing rooms were clean when we visited and appeared to be well monitored by staff. Not ideal for swimming, far too warm,",
          "This is a spring fed outdoor pool much like you'd find in a hotel or apartment block. The water was 39C so think of it as an oversized jacuzzi. There are separate changing facilities with lockers which are a doller for every time you lock the door. Some reviews here say they",
          "We visited Banff recently and thought we would leave the \u201chot springs\u201d until last. Gutted was an understatement! The hot springs are in fact a swimming pool.

          "We went to go to the hot springs but was really disappointed with how big the place was. We have been to hot springs in New Zealand and Iceland and unfortunately this was nothing more than a small swimming pool",
          "We love the hot springs! It is our favourite thing to do in Banff, it is always a great experience. The price isn\u2019t outrageous for a pool; it is very nice that they provide you with a locker token. Towel rental prices are kinda steep so bring a towel! My only complaint is that",
          "Had my mom here to experience Banff so we checked out the hot springs. Parked and got our stuff ready and as you\u2019re walking towards it there\u2019s an area for you to look into the hot springs from above - so glad we got that look - the hot springs pool is not huge and was absolutely",
          "The location is basically a fee-based public pool. It was crowded, the change room floor was quite dirty, and the water temperature could have been slightly higher. On one side there was a nice backdrop of the mountains, but the pool was so busy that you could not appreciate it",
          "Banff hot springs. Large change room, well priced. Only downside is it\u2019s hard to find parking and very very busy on holidays and weekends. Great views. Much like a pool very comfortable temperature.",
          "My family and I enjoyed our time in the pool. We went around late afternoon and found the place to be pretty busy. The pool is small. Change rooms are provided along with lockers. Towels are extra. They have a gift shop there that offers gifts and bathing suits and slippers, but",
          "We went at about 930pm on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy but it honestly didnt take away from the experience. Stunning views and relaxing hot spring. It felt unreal to me. I havent felt this relaxed in years! It costs a buck for a locker rental, you can also rent towels",

          "Had a great time at the hot springs. Wasn\u2019t packed and was raining so that added to the experience. Reasonably priced and worth the visit.",

Water temperature was kept at 40C degrees according to the sign on the wall. Their web site listed the top five minerals found in",
          "Nice, but it doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. The hot springs were originally used for their natural health benefits. Now they add chlorine to the water, which kind of defeats the whole healing/natural aspect. It\u2019s kind of cool that the water is heated naturally, but nothing else is",

          "Disappointed that the hot pool smelt n felt more like a hot chlorinated swimming pool instead of a hot spring pool. Showers din work n those that did had cold water running out instead of hot. Possibly only 2 had hot water running. But i liked the spacious, ample n well",

          "Apparently public sex is not dissuaded. I would say that it is so obvious an 8 year old would notice, but was able to direct my twins attention elsewhere. Given the manner in which everyone ignored it, would suspect it is a 'thing' to do. Kids spent a longer than usual time",
          "The hot springs are truly amazing. We went early in the morning and it was nice and quiet. It was lovely seeing the sun rise over the mountains as well. Would recommend 1000% without a doubt.",

          "Very cheap entry fee. Lovely staff and very friendly. The hot spring is what it says on the tin. -22 outside but the water was 40 degrees c. It takes your breath when you first get in. Very relaxing atmosphere. A must if you have done alot of walking and winter activities.",
          "This is good fun! The outside temperature was -35 the first day we went - everyone's hair was frozen. There are some lovely mountain views and the water was warm, indeed hot, and the whole experience very enjoyable if a little mad.",
          "The name very descriptive, it is a \u201c Hot Springs\u201d attraction without stating the obvious, it is very hot !! Adults that were first time visitors as we were could clearly be seen taking a bit of time to get used to the temperature of the water. I was both shocked and disturbed",
          "It\u2019s worth a visit and good after a day on the slopes, but if you have a jacuzzi where you are staying, I\u2019d suggest using that as it will not be as busy and you don\u2019t have to pay for access and towels like you do here.",
          "The Banff hot springs was a fantastic treat. I went there and was amazed by the beauty that surrounded you. It was awe inspiring. Very much worth it!!",

          "We visited the Banff hot springs as it was included complimentary in our lift pass. However I found that the changing rooms were disgusting. The floor was swimming in freezing cold water, and smelt very damp. I would advise bringing flip flops, as I would avoid traipsing round",

          "So maybe this is because I\u2019m American and we do not have many hot pools around but my husband and I were very uncomfortable during this experience. We were expecting natural hot springs. It was just like a large heated pool. The steam was so thick I really couldn\u2019t even enjoy",
          "It was so busy when we went in feb at approx 1700. Huge line to get in to the pool and the pool was packed with people. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortably busy though. Was really relaxing and We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The change rooms and showers were large and the female",

          "Do yourself a favour and just use the hot tub at your hotel... then at least you don't have to share it with as many people AND you can have the jets massage your body. It's just a quite small sized hot pool with people sitting and floating around and not a natural thing about",
          "Such a neat experience in the winter. They were shocked at how warm it was, but were soon comfortable. It was really quiet too, which was nice with the kids. Change rooms are thorough and convenient. This will be a regular winter treat for sure.",
          "The hot springs are a nice treat after a big day skiing. It was the busiest I have ever seen it! Had to wait about 30mins to get in! Go mid week if possible! It was nuts! Staff were awesome and friendly though. Big kudos to them for putting up with all of us and still smiling",
          "Such a great way to end our stay in the Banff area. We really enjoyed the hot springs and the view over Banff is really nice. They have towels, lockers and even swimsuits you can rent for a very low price. The water temperature is great for relaxing but found myself sitting on",

          "The hot springs isn\u2019t what I expected a hot spring to look like but it was a nice experience. They have towels, lockers and even swimsuits you can rent for a very low price. The water temperature is great for relaxing the sore muscles after a long day/week on the slopes. The",
          "4/5 cause the whole one side was blocked off so u couldn\u2019t get out and see the view. Decently priced I\u2019d say. And luckily for me they rent shorts!! Showers are very helpful after.",
          "I was unsure about this destination as we were off to Sulphur Mountain afterwards but the timing was great. Everything was catered for, you could hire swimwear and towels, token lockers provided, ( be aware they are one use tokens only so do not forget anything you may need to",
          "Great place!! This place is truly excellent and is not to be missed. Can be extremely busy on weekends but weekdays are very enjoyable and quiet. Highly recommended!",
          "We had not been back to the Upper Hot Springs for a while but decided to visit as we had free tickets through the Ski packages. There is no parking by the Springs and you have to walk outdoors between the parking lot and the building which is not the most convenient. I did",
          "We visit the hot springs every time we come to Banff. It\u2019s best to go without children since it\u2019s usually crowded and they can\u2019t swim and get bored just sitting there. I love going after a long day of physical activity. It revitalizes my muscles so I\u2019m ready for the next day.",
          "Loved this place, we went on the 30th and the 31st and it was amazing both times! Although the line was a little long and there was only one person manning the till downstairs, the line seemed to go quite smooth. Temperature was about -13c outside and the pool was 38c. The only",

There might be 100 other people floating in the middle, vying for a seat on the pool edge, but that\u2019s what makes it fun. At 40 degrees, the water is derived from",
          "The hot spring was our first experience of this kind. It was very reasonably priced. The water was very relaxing. We stayed across in a hotel and it took us less than 5 minutes to get there. The place was clean and has a nice cafeteria.",
          "Discovered in 1883, Banff Upper Hot Springs is a commercially developed hot spring in Banff National Park. It is outdoors at 1,585 metres of elevation looking across a valley to Mount Rundle. The spring (geothermally heated groundwater) feeding the facility is one of nine,",
          "Okay the location is nice and at first glance it seems a good idea.... but. It\u2019s just a swimming pool, with really hot water! There are far to many people and it just seemed to be a big \u2018bath in\u2019 ? Yes the water is hot and really nice when it\u2019s cold outside but this was not what",
          "It's a great way to start the day. Get there first thing and it's nice and quiet. After a couple of hours it gets busy and noisy, so not as relaxing then. The walkway into the pool begins in the building which helps. Very reasonable price and well worth a visit.",
          "We left Calgary thinking that this was going to be a romantic day. We got there and were in the pool for 20 mins. Some brown leaf looking stuff was floating around. Everyone thought they were leaves. 2 seconds later the lady announces that the pool in contaminated and",
          "We were there in late summer after a day of hiking....it was not overly surprising to find the pool rather full at that time of year - but honestly, the situation was just awful. As a chemist whose job was to assess pool water quality for a few years, I have to say that this",
          "We weren\u2019t fans! It\u2019s really just a giant hot shallow swimming pool! If you have a hot tub or pool at your lodge you are better off just dipping in that!",
          "This is what Banff is all about. Since I was a kid we've come to Banff and the Hot Springs. Very relaxing. Interesting people from all over the world. This is part of what makes Banff so magical, especially in the winter. We're very happy to have had the opportunity to visit",
          "We visited Banff in mid December and unlike what we thought, it was really beautiful in winter time. The weather was ok and people were skating on the frozen ice everywhere, so if you are a fan of ice skating together with enjoying the beautiful views of snowy mountains and",
          "Such a great way to end our stay in the Banff area. We really enjoyed the hot springs and the view over Banff is really nice. A little crowded, but that was not really a problem",
          "It was more like a hot pool than a hot springs. Smelled like chlorine. It was very crowded (I did go on a Saturday afternoon). For such a popular tourist attraction I was expecting multiple pools. It has a beautiful view. I didn't like the Christmas lights hung around the",
          "When you are sitting in the pool, the view is amazing. This is a perfect spot for a couples retreat or a bachelorette as I was there for. The accommodations are very nice and have a lot to offer if you are needing to accommodate a large group. I recommend staying here. I didn't",
          "Let\u2019s be frank and to the point. This isn\u2019t a natural hot bath like you imagine. It\u2019s an over crowded touristy public swimming pool- that\u2019s old and full of too many people. Period. The staff are extremely friendly, the setting is absolutely stunning, but so is any spot in Banff.",
          "The other reviewers speak for me already. I certainly wouldn't describe it as overcrowded during my visit with my girlfriend in the early afternoon in December, but I can imagine it could become a lot busier. The water is a lovely 39 degrees and was lovely for an hour or so. Not",
          "Still kinda old school feel. Not to much has changed in the 30 years we have come here and that\u2019s a good thing. Not sure if we just hit it right but we have always felt like it\u2019s not to busy and very pleasant to hang out and soak. I\u2019m sure they would prefer it to be stuffed to",
          "I took the #1 bus from town for $2 and it is a short ride away until you're there. Around 2 o'clock in the afternoon when I got there and it was very quiet only a few other groups there. It was very relaxing and the views are amazing!",
          "We had not been to the Hot Springs in years and were very pleasantly surprised by the upgrades that have been done since our last visit. The biggest improvement is that the water is no longer has the overpowering smell of sulpher. We spent over an hour soaking in the 40 degree",
          "We visited in July and the pool was packed with people. Heavily chlorinated and very small. Also I don't like that people outside up the top can look down at you in the pool. Think it was a waste of money even though it wasn't that expensive. Save your cash and time not worth",

          "This is a \u2018must visit\u2019 location The Banff springs are amazing- an outdoor natural spring with a temperature of 40 C. The fact that the ambient temp was -10 made it an awesome experience. It can be very busy so it\u2019s best to.visit later in the evening of night. We went at 9:30 pm",
          "This is a place not to miss when visiting Banff, Alberta! Towels are available for rent if needed. Long line-ups to get in but worth the wait.",
          "The idea behind it is great but having gone there while I lived in Banff I found it underwhelming because of the overcrowded pool and smell of water drains. The hot springs is a pool sized hot tub at the top of the mountains which makes for a great view but unless you arrive",

          "You can rent towels and suits even. The water is usually about 39 degrees. Super relaxing. Would take a star off if I could simply for the fact my husband falls asleep by 8 pm each time we go. :-). Super relaxing.",
          "I had been to the hot springs a few years ago but it was a first time for my partner and our 1.5 year old daughter. I was a little worried my daughter would be fussy with the experience but she absolutely loved it! She wore a PFD with about swallowed her up but it allowed her",

I plan on",

          "We planned the Hot Springs for after we spent the day explorering Johnston Canyon and Falls. They charged around $7-8 per person to enter the Hot Springs. Temperature ran from 98-104*. The locker rooms were very clean and you took a shower before and after being in the pool.",
          "We arrived right at the opening time in only 12 people in front of us. Line up moved fast and efficiently. Locker room is clean and lockers large. The pool is limited to about 225 people, so we had lots of room. By time we left, there were only about 35 people in the pool.",
          "The hot springs cannot cope with the demand of guests. We waited half hour up stairs to enter the hot springs. Cheap entry and you can pay to hire a towel or swimming costume (not my personal choice). The changing rooms are ok - half of the lockers have lost keys or do not work",
          "Quite crowded with locals when we went at 3pm on a Saturday Very clean and quite hot at 39C An interesting experience!",
          "We eased our aches and pains into the pool while taking in the stunning views of the Rockies while they gathered more snow. The sun poked through the clouds and lit up the recent snows. We visited several families and shared our stories. By the time we left, the healing mineral",
          "We only stayed for about an hour because the water was very hot but we enjoyed our soak! The price is right as well. A locker is included in the adult admission but bring a towel from your hotel to save a buck or two.",

          "We spent time at Banff Upper Hot Springs. The pool was very warm at 39C and it felt wonderful. The view from the pool is awesome. This is a pool in which to sit and relax. It's not a place to swim and splash around as you will quickly over heat. Sit back, soak and enjoy!!",
          "Everyone here is talking about the mountains and the pool and what not, but I would like to take a moment to talk about the lifeguards. A little backstory on me, I am a pretty healthy 17 year old with no existing medical issues to note, that being said, today I was feeling",
          "These are worth a visit if you have been active during the day. Then you have to choose when to go because late afternoon becomes busy as a result. The pool hold 200 but when I went 100 was enough. Space to sit round the edge of the pool and some seating on the side. It is not a",
          "A good place to spend an hour. You can hire towels and lockers cheaply. It doesn\u2019t matter what the weather is doing as the pool temperature is 39 degrees. The Sulphur springs are good for your body unless you have medical conditions. They have a small cafe for drinks and snacks.",

          "It was a little run down. The hot pool was small and with lots of people there on an afternoon it was very crowded. I met interesting people from all over the world. The locker room was nice. It had been renovated. The locker room was clean The pool and the outside areas",

          "Pool looks very busy from above. When you enter there is enough space to find a seat or drift around the pool. Locker room and showers are efficient and spacious. Cafe seems to be a little drab and boring. Easy location to find with adequate parking below.",
          "It was a foggy morning and we were off to relax in the hot pools..housed in a historic bathing pavilion up near the gondola, we soaked in 39 degrees waters whilst taking in the magnificent alpine scenery. The price per adult was about CA$8.50 including a complimentary towel and",

We also visited Miette Hot Springs which we much preferred but would still recommend a quick visit to these if you\u2019re",

          "This is our 3rd visit to Banff and you can't come to Banff without going in the hot springs! The water is so hot it takes your breathe away at first! We like how you walk straight into the water from the changing rooms. There is a shallow pool for lying around in which is",
          "We arrived early so as to enjoy the pool before it got too busy. Spent an hour just relaxing in the warmth. The changing rooms were clean and costumes and towels are available to rent if you have come unprepared. Just one negative, the view is not as spectacular as the one at",

          "The view of the sky on a clear night is nice however it isn\u2019t the prettiest hot springs I\u2019ve ever visited. Like a large hot tub with lots of people. The lockers are annoying, beware you can only use that token once!",
          "After a couple days of hiking, we decided to unwind with a soak in some hot springs. We've been in hot springs in different parts of BC as well as in other countries, but would be our first time in the Rockies. We came in the afternoon and ended up buying their double pass to",
          "This is the place to go if you want to experience luxury at an affordable price. Get into the hot pool in the open air and feel the tension disappear as the hot mountain water soothes you all over. If you do nothing else in Banff you must do this. I can't wait to go back again.",
          "It was late spring when we went to Banff and the hot springs baths, There was still plenty of snow on the ground and an air temp of about 6oC it was weird to be warm and outdoors with a splendid view and floating around with admittedly lots and lots of other people. Their",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was very cold outside and it was wonderful to enjoy the warmth of the water. We went when it opened and we and four friends had the pool to ourselves for the first 20 minutes. Very cheap to enter and you get a towel. You can also hire costumes",

          "I was disappointed with this site. It was advertised that it was rustic and when I arrived there it was basically a swimming pool. The temperature of the pool was 38 degrees, but it was also very over-crowded. I would not rush back to this tourist site, also I got a BC Parks",

          "A must see in Banff. We didn\u2019t stay long as we visited during one of the hottest days of the year. I recommend cooler weather, or a summer evening. Only need about an hour here.",
          "The water is lovely and warm but it\u2019s basically an older swimming pool fed by the hot springs without any slides or anything for kids to play with. Neither outdoorsy natural hot springs or a regular pool. Nice for a relaxing soak though",
          "I love a good hot springs. We had a short visit due to a thunderstorm coming upon us. However, we enjoyed the experience. I wish it didn't look so much like a pool--had more natural character to it, but nevertheless, it was very nice. Totally worth it--even if it's a bit",
          "There is only one pool and way too many people. For the space they have they should add another pool either for kids or a cold pool.",
          "Amazing view and amazing place to visit with anyone very friendly staff with fully informed and always willing to help tourists and also very caring when it comes to kids or elders and looks like they are very well trained",
          "Glad we went for a warm soak on a coolish summer evening. Everything you need Canberra rented here or bring your own. Pool is large but can get crowded. The view is very nice and it is worth the short drive be from town to relax.",
          "Definitely a must, especially that we couldnt make it to Radium Hot Springs due to fire and highway 93 being closed.. It can get busy though in afternoon.",
          "If your idea of a good time is standing with 200 other people in a public hot tub, this is your jam. If you prefer to have room to turn around, enjoy cleanliness and don't want to wait in line to to be processed like feed cattle, go anywhere but here. Don't believe the hype,",
          "Banff is fantastic, but the hot springs area is small and overcrowded. We have been to other hot springs with multiple pools and tons of space, but this was basically packed with people in a small, ordinary looking pool. Decided we were better off checking out more of the",
          "We went at 9 am, no queue and only about 40 people in the pool, we were there for about one hour including getting changed. The car park was full by the time we left. I do think they could make more of such a great natural resource, it is all very functional, and there isn\u2019t",
          "I expected natural pools - in the woods.... lots of people were enjoying the public pool that looked like s community pool back home (complete with life guards). It just was not what I expected.",
          "Can be considered a fun activity but in terms of environment and serenity, it is far from what I have experienced in Japan. It is really crowded both in changing room and at the hot spring pool. Couldn't really connect with the nature even thought the water is coming from",
          "After we visited the Gondola and the top of Sulphur Mountain, we decided to go to the Hot Springs pool. They have a beautiful building with a fantastic view. Enter the building and go downstairs to get access. $25.00 for a family of four as I recall. They have change rooms",
          "Very clean, organized and scenic with lots of history. They have everything to rent in case you came unprepared.",
          "Sounds lovely on paper but is actually just an overpriced outdoor swimming pool with extremely rude staff. We were in the pool for approximately 5 minutes until lightening started and we were informed that the pool must shut - fair enough. We were told we could receive a \u2018rain",
          "This is a very popular place, especially in afternoon. We arrived by 2 and it was busy, but leaving around 3:30 the lineup of those arriving was quite long. The water is very warm, so they recommend you don\u2019t stay in long (you don\u2019t have to leave) but there isn\u2019t a lot of deck",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Very cheap. Fantastic views! Parking available. You can even rent towels and swimsuits.",
          "As you walk up the sulphur smell hits you and you hope you're not going to walk away stinking of rotten eggs, but its ok-the water in the pool is filtered and doesn't smell. :-) The water itself is lovely and warm (40\u00b0C), but you can not spend long in it at one time. They",
          "We stopped by after a day of traveling and it was just a perfect way to relax. I would recommend going at night as it has a more magical experience.",
          "Arrive early to get there when it\u2019s empty (9am) - capacity 205, only got to about 40 people by the time we left. Really relaxing baths with outstanding views. Good way to soak away the aches after long days of activity.",
          "Good pricing. We went after hikes so it was good for our muscles. We went on a cool day which was nice if you got to hot. The historic bathing suits made us laugh.",
          "This place was very crowded. Good luck finding a place along the edge of the pool. Water temperature was decent, around 39 degrees Celsius.",
          "Nice place to go. We were surprised of the typical sulfur smell that welcomed us on the parking lot. A small cave with hot mineral springs and an outside pool too. Used to be a bathing place but now the typical flora and fauna has been restored showing a complete different word",
          "Visited about 9.30 pm. A good time to visit as it was not too busy. Didn't really expect it to be busy but there was about 150 people in the pool. Pool was 39 degrees. A nice experience.",
          "We went here one evening after a long strenuous hike. The timing seemed good as there were no queues ut the pool was quite busy. We managed to find a nice spot to sit and allow the hot waters do their magic. Unfortunately our relaxation was cut short as everyone had to evacuate",
          "Decided to check this place out for a few hours. First off getting through the town of Banff just to get to this place is a bit of a challenge. At least it was around 3pm in July on a weekday. Parking was crazy, but we were able to get a spot in the lot and walk to the springs.",
          "This is a great place to relax in the Rocky Mountains right in Banff townsite. This is an affordable attraction, and easy to get to - shuttle buses go up the mountain from the townsite. A large hot-pool fed by natural hot springs. Be aware that it can get busy, so plan to go",
          "Worst hot spring ever. Too small for the amount of people they try to cram in. Banff itself is too expensive too crowded too commercial. If you can, avoid Banff all together unless you have money.",
          "This is nothing wrong with the springs, which is very nice (maybe the staff were just tired at the end of the day..) went along and 97% of people were hanging by the side of the pool chatting to friends. Attempting to gently swim through the warm water meant the teenager was so",
          "The hot springs are nothing better than a hot bath. It\u2019s very crowded and probably the worst hot springs I\u2019ve ever been too. There was nothing unique or interesting or remotely natural about these hot springs, but still nice to relax in after a long day of hiking or shopping but",
          "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when walking in to go to the spring. From first glance it just looks like a pool. But the water was 39 degrees that day. It was pretty cool and they\u2019re right to advise not to stay in more that ten minutes at s time. As it can make you a bit",
          "The Hot Springs are definitely a great way to relax and soothe any aching muscles after a day of hiking or trekking around the Banff attractions. But at 39 degrees C (or ~ 102 degrees F), you shouldn\u2019t plan on swimming laps!! The water is warm enough, though, that this can be a",
          "It's really something to douse yourself in these mineral rich waters heated by nature. Only 6 to 8 Canadian dollars. You can buy a bathing suit if you don't have one. Toast up in the water and then take a cold shower - then jump in the pool again. We did it in the summer...it",
          "Great experience. It\u2019s in a pool. Well organised. My favourite thing was the swimwear drying machine took 2 minutes to dry them! Incredible invention! Lockers are provided and they rent out the swimwear too!",
          "Best visited after 9! Wasn't very crowded, coat was low, was very relaxing amidst the cool mountain air and beautiful surroundings.",
          "If you're looking for a hot springs dip near Banff, this is the place. It's not overly large or beautiful or impeccably maintained. It's usually quite crowded, too. You'll get a dip in the pool but I don't expect to be overly impressed with the facilities or the experience.",
          "Fun and affordable to experience a hot spring but the ambiance was more like a large hot public pool.",
          "Its basically just a hot man made pool with nice views. We went late at night and it was packed out. I wouldn't go to this one again I'd probably try the radium hot springs if I was to go again.",
          "I was expecting more from the Banff Upper Hot Springs. There are nice views, and the water is very warm and soothing. However, it felt more like a crowded swimming pool than a special experience. Try going very early in the morning or late a night to see if you can get a quieter",
          "This was my first time ever visiting the hot springs having lived in Alberta all my life. I was not disappointed. I'm not sure about other reviews here but I went with my friend and her daughter and had a great time. We went mid morning on a Tuesday after driving up from Calgary",
          "This us a really nice place to spend and hour.The view from the hot pools is awesome. The water was 39 degrees which was quite warm being as the out side temperature was 32. Changing rooms were cleaned often. You can rent towels if need be. I recommed a visit.",
          "This is a scenic way to relax sore muscles after a day of hiking or on the slopes. The view is spectacular but the pools are busy, even in the late evening.",
          "We were disappointed with the amount of people that were shoved into the pool. There was barely any room to move. I would recommend maybe trying to go at night or early in the morning to avoid the crowds.",
          "Visited the Banff (incidently Banff In Scotland is a friendly and more genuine place to visit) Upper Hot Springs and went for a dook. It is overpriced and tiny. The water is hot and chlorinated .. no trace of the suposedly health giving sulphur. My advice is to take a bath in",
          "The springs felt like an iconic thing to do while in the Canadian Rockies. This was organized and clean and checked the box. The views were beautiful. Definitely crowded and a bit like a cattle call though.",
          "These hot springs are up the road towards the Fairmount Hotel in Banff but instead of going left to the Fairmount you go right up to the hot springs. We had to wait in a long line to get in but it moved relatively fast. You may a modest fee to get in and rent a towel for a",
          "Thought this would be great but it\u2019s a pool that is chlorinated and heated by the spring water. Wouldn\u2019t go again.",
          "Well, it might be that the water come from hot springs but the surrounding is more like a public pool with hot water. Pretty crowded and not very inspiring. We gave it 15 minutes. Spend the time at Cave and Basin instead.",
          "The experience was awesome. Was expecting something different. One should do a 10 mins in and 3 minutes out and keep hydrated. Water tends to be quite warm. it was 39 C when we visited.",
          "I visit the hot springs in the winter which was so breath taking being surrounded my snowy trees. The views are outstanding. Highly recommend making the trek up here, you won\u2019t be disappointed",
          "I remember smelling the strong smell of sulphur all around as we would approach the springs. Now there is only the faint hint of it as you walk past the small water fall just before you reach the entrance to the springs. The water is about 103 degrees and you should only be in",
          "We knew there was a shuttle but we tried anyway. That's on us, but we were coming back from a long hike and hoped it would work out since it was later afternoon. A main problem seems to be that the ridiculous crowds for the Banff Gondola ride use the parking lot for the Hot",
          "I took advantage of Banff National Park's willingness to rent out the Upper Hot Springs pool for a private party an hour before public opening. So, the six members of our family party were able to luxuriate in the large pool from 8 to 9 a.m. all by ourselves. It was a glorious",
          "Best value swim we have ever had For $16 we had a fab time enjoying the warm waters and the surroundings Amazing views of Mountains which were wrapped in clouds that were constantly changing in both colour and shape Water Temperature was 39 degrees on afternoon we visited",
          "We spotted the hot spring from the gondola so decided to pay it a visit. If you didn\u2019t bring your swimmers, you can rent a bathing suit. The pool is nice and hot but still quite crowded at 9:00pm in summer time. I can\u2019t handle the Sulfur smells so 20 minutes to half an hour is",
          "We attempted to go to the springs several times yet it was always super crowded. Would love it if they had some natural springs.",
          "The pool is crowded and noisy, it's like being in a public pool. After all teh lovely scenery and lake visits we ended up at the Hot Springs around 6 pm. The changing facilities are filthy, the pool was way too crowded. Make sure you take your own towels. We would not do it",
          "The Hot Springs were very good very good for families with teenagers and for families with young children the water is extremely hot so I would not recommend it for seniors because it is very warm",
          "We went right when it opened one day in Nov so it wasn\u2019t too busy which was nice. It had a light snow happening so it was an awesome atmosphere and the views on the mountains in winter were spectacular",
          "Relaxing hot spring close to the gondola. Although it was about 10am, it was fairly busy and limited space in the pool.",
          "Its a busy pool, which is expected. You pay to enter, once you leave you have to pay again, aka a one-and-done soak. The pool is big and the views are great. The changing room, showers, etc are clean and in great condition. The pool can be very busy. For us, about an hour",
          "We visited the hot springs the day after a long hike down the mountain from Lake Louise. We had 4 kids between the ages of 4 and 11 with us and they all enjoyed the visit, as did the adults. The facility was clean and the staff very friendly!",
          "Nice , fairly priced experience but the springs were fairly busy and we were still in The \u201coff season\u201d and there on a cool rainy day. We enjoyed our time just relaxing In the hot springs (big pool). Nice that they have the showers and lockers there included in the price and we",
          "I love hot water, so this was fabulous for me. The temp was 104\u00b0 and felt great especially: A) during a light rain storm with cool breezes B) after a long hike up one of Banff's many mountains...completely relaxed my sore lower back. Plus, your skin feels so soft afterward!",
          "Best $16 we spent all trip. Had a most relaxing time in the pool. Water was nice and hot like it should be. Would do it again and again if I lived near by. Bring your OWN bathing suit...",
          "Naturally fed hot spring swimming pool that gazes upon glorious mountains! Not too stinky like some hot springs can be. Wheelchair accessible right into the pool. Lockers are from the 80's but they provide you with a token so you won't get your quarters eaten by a faulty lock.",
          "It was a beautiful clear but cold day, we parked in the snow laden car park and made our way up to the springs. Greeted by a friendly local we were taken through the pricing and general rules. We paid out $10.00 it may have been less, and made our way to the spring. The change",
          "Visting from Australia and had spent the past two days hiking so the springs was a great way to relax all the sore mussels",
          "We always try to take visitors to the Banff Hot Springs, as it's a great, inexpensive experience for them. You can even rent historical swimsuits if you are so inclined! Admission for adults is $8 CDN, but there are also rates for children and families. Your admission gets you",
          "Spent an hour or so here. Fabulously clean facilities. Water wonderful and hot - very relaxing. You can rent old style swimwear and towels at reasonable prices. A little bit crowded but then again we were there on a cold wet day so I think others had the same idea to keep warm.",
          "Beautiful mountain top hot spring said pool. We rode our bikes from Kenmore, to Banff and had lunch at stock. Then we biked up to the Hot Springs. Sometimes, my kids were forced to get off their bikes and walk. It was all for garden by the beauty of the Hot Springs. Basking in",
          "After walking up Sulphar Mountain going to the hot springs was great. The water temperature was relaxing on the muscles. We went after 7pm so it wasn\u2019t too busy. The number one bus gets you all the way there and back to downtown Banff.",
          "Springs were warm, and the place was clean. Dryers were out of order, and it was total chaos due to a school group.",
          "This is a short walk from the gondola, so it\u2019s a must before you descend. Just 10 dollars for entry and a towel, Water is 39 degrees. Lovely and relaxing after days of walking and sightseeing.",
          "Great way to finish off a days skiing relaxing in the open hot spring pool. Very family and people friendly. Groups of old men reviewing the day and young women in packs within their phones chatting.",
          "Nice relaxing not too stinky sulfur. A tad crowded but still nice. Great on a chilly day and really affordable.",
          "We tried out the Banff Upper Hot Springs on our trip to Banff. Despite the mixed reviews from some on Trip Advisor. We arrived around 6:00pm figuring that it would not be busy. Water was 39 degrees celsius which was pretty warm. The place was still pretty packed at the time",
          "I always at least once go to the hot springs every time I go to the mountains. It\u2019s relaxing but do NOT go during peak hours. For what it is, not worth it to be waiting in line or having no space in the pool. Go though if you have the time.",
          "I\u2019ve visited hot springs in other countries and was looking forward to our trip. What I didn\u2019t expect was a glorified swimming pool. You wouldn\u2019t have known if you were in a very warm swimming pool or hot springs. Yes it\u2019s cheap, but personally I think it\u2019s a waste of time and",
          "We enjoyed our visit although the kids got very hot in the water. Take your towel in with you so you can sit out and have a break from the water now and then. It would be nice if you could buy drinks on the side too.",
          "Visited mid-afternoon on a Sunday. The changing room and washroom was disgusting and poorly maintained. The pool had hair floating everywhere along with floating chunks of who knows what. It did not appear that the water was maintained. The only positive was the amazing view.",
          "We got to the baths at 9.30pm and couldn\u2019t believe how many people were there. The French Canadian customer service person was so friendly. The baths were clean and well set up. Even though a little noisy with so many people, the experience of being outside with the sun going",
          "Considering how expensive the rest of Banff is, this was quite reasonable. Hard to find a spot when it's so busy, but our kids had fun and that made it fun for us. Wouldn't do it everyday if we lived there, and we don't live there, so don't be a grouch. Maybe some signs pointing",
          "This is a well maintained spot where you can just relax and unwind after a long day of walking or doing whatever you've done. The change rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and the views are one of a kind. Check this place out if you want to just relax!",
          "My friends convinced me to go to the hot springs after a full day of activities. It was not too crowded, process was easy to get in and the entry fee reasonable. The views from the pool were great but we thought there would be more pools. Nonetheless we spent a good hour",
          "There were 4 of us adults. We arrived and gift shop and coffee shop not open til 11 am...seriously!! The hot springs has been designed as an out door community pool which takes away from the hot springs experience. They should've made it look authentic.... but it was a great",
          "Excellent place to soak in in the hot spring after few days of hiking to relax the sore muscles and at the same enjoy the beautiful surrounding mountains. Awesome \ud83d\ude01",
          "We've been here before and it was always fine. We had passes as part of our ski and stay package. We got there and it didn't seem to busy while in line up with about 4 people ahead of us. Then we noticed a lady run up and say \"you can count them, there's 67 there!\" and run",
          "Wife and I enjoyed stopping in after a long day of hiking. It\u2019s like a giant hot tub. Wasn\u2019t too busy. Nice views.",
          "This place was such a waste of time. It\u2019s a glorified heated pool with an alright view (you can find better views around Banff). It\u2019s a public pool that charges you 8 bucks to get in. Save your money and just get into the heated pool at your hotel. It\u2019s the same crap. Very",
          "We didn\u2019t use the springs , but we had a lovely lunch here and coffee to warm us up , would love to use the springs next time we visit, beautiful locations of springs looking down towards Banff",
          "Well 1st time at a hot springs and this was excellent value for money. Lovely view of the mountains and the heat of the pool was increadable. Was that good ended up visiting 3 times whilst in Banff. Recomend jumping on the bus to get here only 5 dollars. Staff here were great.",
          "We enjoyed our stop at the Upper Hot Springs \u2014 but it did feel a bit touristy. Be prepared to wait in line for admission if during peak hours. Entrance fare is reasonably priced and worth it for a 30-minute dip.",
          "The pricing is very fair, especially in comparison to other hot springs (such as Radium), this place is much hotter. Lovely in winter. My only complaint is how crowded it gets, and you are left to stand in the pool instead of sit. Not a huge deal really, as this kind of thing",
          "What\u2019s all the fuss? So difficult to find a parking spot? Why are there lineups to get in? Crowded change rooms once you do. And patrons packed like sardines inside the Hot Spring Pool. The initial answer to all the above doesn\u2019t surface until you are showered, dressed and",
          "1st visit to these hot springs. It was about $10 per person for entry and a towel and included a token for the lockers to store your clothing. Rental swimsuits were also available for an additional fee. The locker room was large with plenty of lockers available. There are",
          "Banff Upper Hot Springs was right across from the hotel we were staying at so we decided to drive up to have a peek. We found that we could not park at the top, but had to park near the gondola or back at our hotel and walk up. Admission prices are pretty reasonable at under $10",
          "Great value and a must following a long day of sightseeing. Like a public swimming pool with a comfortable 39 deg C waters !!! Very pleasant and relaxing, the baths recommend spending a max of 20 mins but that rule is generally ignored. Getting there is by the the local tourist",
          "The Banff hot springs are legend - ie the are a core Banff experience and have been around longer than Banff was a park. Hours are good- 9 to 10pm much of the year and price is great, $8.30 for an adult. You can also rent towels and bathing suits, lockers are free. For all",
          "very good but make sure you take a water bottle with you and it is better if you go at fall maybe winter and at night because when we went in the summer it was really hot and you could not stay for a long time.you could rent towels and you get a locker token with every",
          "First the good. The water was very nice and warm, 40 degrees Celsius, and as the evening had cooled down a bit, it made it enjoyable to rest and relax in the water. After a long day of walking and activity, it was nice to let the muscles relax. However, it just didn\u2019t meet my",
          "Busted these spring whilst in Banff and though a good experience was nothing special, nice to add onto the day you do the gondola as it is right next door. Wouldn\u2019t recommend as the only activity for the day though . Approximately 30 minutes was enough for us",
          "We thought this would be a true hot spring adventure, not just a swimming pool. Water temperature was 85 degrees and chlorinated. That took some of the pleasure out of the experience. I feel we could have just used the hot tub at the hotel.",
          "No maintenance at all We leave in Calgary and we usually come to banff 3 or 4 time a year. In the past 10 years they never ever fixed or maintain this hot spring. I don't know where all the fees they charge peaple is spended but almost half of the lockers don't have a lock, the",
          "We went, we soaked. Met some nice people, relaxing environment. Facilities were nice and clean. Entrance fees are reasonable. Would go again when in Banff.",
          "I have been here on more than 1 occasion! I love what you get for the price you pay. It\u2019s one of the nicest AND cheapest things to do in Banff. The views are really pretty. Go there just before dusk so you can enjoy the views but also be there in the evening. Also it\u2019s not as",
          "The place was packed but you could still find some room to enjoy the warmth of the water in a chill evening.",
          "Received free tickets to this place so, on our fourth visit to Banff finally made the drive up the hill to visit. Glad we did. Essentially it is an outdoor swimming pool fed by a natural hot spring. Soaking in the warm water (think hot bath) as snow falls and ice forms in your",
          "Even though it can be crowded this is a great attraction. The hot springs are quite modern but there are lots of pieces that keep you connected to the history. The water is tell hot!",
          "It has all the basic stuffs you will need for a very relaxing soaking - and a great view! I've visited in the ending of April and the hotsprings were not at their max, so the water there was heated and provided by the municipality. But it worth it.",
          "There is parking but it's a bit of a climb up on foot to the entrance once you've left your car. It wasn't too busy the day we went to the hot springs facility. But there is limited capacity in the pool at any given time so I imagine during peak season, there's a good chance",
          "It took us quite a while to get to the hot springs on the Banff roam bus, we waited 30 mins on the bus and it was much further out of town than we thought. It was a really cold evening but the hot springs were really busy, lots of other people had the same idea as us. It was",
          "Having been to Banff many times, my husband & I thought we would check out the Banff Upper Hot Springs during our visit. The property is 4 kms from the Banff townsite & I recommend you use the Banff Roam transit as there is limited parking. The lot itself is down the hill from",
          "We received a free pass from SkiBig3 when reserving with them for a trip. Easy to catch the Red Line ROAM to the base of the spring/pool. You have to walk up the hill to get there, dress warm. Inexpensive. Lockers cost a dollar and you have to pay each time you access. The",
          "Having been here before in the fall we took another trip in the winter. Suspicions were raised when there was no eggy smell, and on exiting and reading some information we found out that in the winter there\u2019s not enough water pressure to proved natural spring water. So it\u2019s",
          "The pool was very warm and the mild temperature outside provided the opportunity to cool down when needed. There were a few groups of young teenagers that went through, so at times the pool was very crowded but overall very enjoyable. The women's change room had a lineup for the",
          "Hot springs were really nice, had opportunity to enjoy a light snowfall while in the pool. Change rooms were kept clean. Locker rental with token included in your admission. They offer swimsuits and towels for rental.",
          "After seeing the history of banff park at the Cave and Basin National Historic site - you got to go the hot springs at least once. But honestly it doesn't do much for me. It didn't help that a large group of teenagers entered the hot springs right before us. It was crazy",
          "The facilities are clean and well run, the spring bath itself is a reasonable size...thing is the place was approaching full capacity on the day we visited and approached the level you\u2019d describe as \u2018crowded\u2019. Not the managements fault as we\u2019d still rather have been allowed in",

But not our favorite part of our trip.",

          "An amazing view and a great experience for all ages. They even have full accessibility for wheelchair users to roll into the pool and be included in the fun. Only complaint would be that the lockers sometimes eat the tokens instead of \u2026",
          "It was a  lovely 40 C when we were there.  Clean, large change areas, even private change areas.",
          "Just a short 10 minute walk from the gondala (free shuttle from the Elk + Avenue hotel) this should be done to round off the Banff experience. \nLockers provided in the changing rooms with a single use token. \nBathing area itself is quite \u2026",
          "Basically a big hot tub without bubbles. Not a fan. But I do see how it would be appealing after a long day of hiking.",
          "Extremely busy on holidays 45 minute lineup.  Good price.  Water 39C wonderful. Fairly clean water and 2 or 3 lifeguards always.  Showers sometimes cooling!",
          "Great place to warm up on a Canadian winter day with an amazing view.",
          "Absolutely worth the visit. The water was amazing. Perfect to soak in after a busy day. The facility was clean and the staff were friendly. The view is amazing. We went when it was slightly raining which was perfectly refreshing.",
          "Not worth going especially if you pay for it. The staff are rude and unprofessional. The facility is not very clean and the pool itself is tiny. The pool also attracts families that bring their kids to splash and learn to swim so it's not \u2026",
          "I would highly recommend this place to relax for one hour get rid of aches and pains",
          "Never a bad choice to take a soak in a hot tub. It is very cool that the hot water is coming from the mountains but the way this is built, it is more or less a big public hot tub. Nothing wrong with that, just don't be expecting a \"natural\" \u2026",
          "So awesome and nice here, everyone should check this out and experience it. Very clean which is a plus.",
          "A well run facility.  The pool felt crowded when we were there but well below the 205 capacity.  Only $20 for two adults with a towel rental. Totally worth it.",
          "Beautiful views. Try to pick anytime that's not busy.",
          "After a long day of hiking around Banff, the hot springs were an excellent way to relax, even complete with a view overlooking the city of Banff. I liked how there was a water fountain right next to the pool, since you can get dehydrated \u2026",
          "A lot of fun, outside pool with +39\u00b0 water, -15\u00b0 outside temp and the snow all over :)",
          "Great feeling as you jump into the natural hot              spring pool...",
          "Cozy and economic hot springs. They rent you swimsuits for $1.90 if you forgot them, but make sure to check for holes first......",
          "An absolute pleasure and must do after a long day on the slopes or just being outside in general.  Very relaxing experience.",
          "Not crowded this time of the year. Hot water is a bit sulfer aroma is very mild nd you can rent a swimsuit and a towel for your just a few dollars. It is the bees knees!",
          "A good experience but was crowded ...they should limit the number  of people.   Hardly any  space to go around ...washrooms are big less lineups...but the pool was really full",
          "It was wonderful to spend a couple hour in hot spring after a long day of hiking .\nWater was 40 degrees and it felt nice being in hot water in rain.\nWas a bit busy.\nI wish they had some music going on and a small bar.then it was more fun.",
          "A wonderful experience of Nature heating and mineralizing water, cleansing your body.",
          "Nice hot springs.  Bring your own towel and bottle water. Not expensive and the parking is free. It was pretty crowded,  especially with teens and kids.  It would be more enjoyable if it was quieter in my opinion.  I was really relaxed when I left so I guess I can't complain.",
          "There is nothing like a good soak in a mountain hot pool to cure what ails you. The Banff pool is nice and hot, is well-appointed and has a beautiful view. It's close to town and easy to get to. It's accessible for the disabled, but I've \u2026",
          "These are not my first hot springs and I was slightly disappointed. The positives were the pool was affordable, clean, plenty of space to change and lockers to store your valuables in. However it was just that, a swimming pool. It didn't \u2026",
          "Amazing experience! Definitely recommend going in the early morning when the mist is still covering the mountain. The best part was how affordable it was \ud83d\ude04",
          "Crowded and disappointing views. However the water was relaxing and refreshing. Renting the historical bathing suit was a fun experience. The miette hot springs in Jasper are less crowded with better views.",
          "Meh. It\u2019s nice but basically just a hot tub with lots of people.",
          "We visited in the evening, around 9.15... The admission is good value for money and you can hire both towels and swim suits if you wish. It was still busy. We had expected the pool to be more natural looking, however, it was more like a very warm, modern looking, swimming pool...We enjoyed the relaxing experience.",
          "We went 1.5 hours to closing. Place was packed but I was able to find a spot to sit on the edge. Water isn\u2019t too deep and just feels like hot tubbing with strangers, the place has more of a pool feel. The water is treated. \n\nNo individual \u2026",
          "Visited the hot springs after a five day hike in the mountains. Loved the shower facility needless to say. The hot springs pool is pretty small and at the time we visited, it wasn't too busy. On a busy day, I imagine the experience would be \u2026",
          "You haven't been to Banff if you don't visit the hot springs. Take a gondola ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain, hike around and then have a soak at the springs. The view alone is worth the price of admission.",
          "Why isn\u2019t there a camera ban at this place?! There was an older gentleman taking random photos of everyone including kids in the pool area. My 13 year old boy was very uncomfortable with this.  Also, I was in the change room  and numerous \u2026",
          "The parking lot has been under construction for almost a year, and October 4th was the worst. Travel out to Banff to see there is a huge hike up the mountain side just to get to the stairs to hike to the hot springs at the top. Would be \u2026",
          "Busier in the evenings and weekends. Best time I've ever visited was middle of the week in January!\nTry timing your visit for sunset. You can't see the sun set, but the fading light in the surrounding mountains and the stars coming out is \u2026",
          "I\u2019ve been to a good variety of hot springs around the globe and truthfully this one falls very short. It\u2019s very commercial. The staff are nice.. which is the only thing nice I have to say. This establishment dilutes the minerals in the \u2026",
          "Seems very busy in July. We had to park halfway down the hill as the parking lot was full. As you might guess, the pool was extremely full as well. For the amount of people that visit Banff they should actually expand the pool to accommodate more people. Then there is always Radium Hot Springs 2 hours away.  :-)",
          "The hot spring itself is pretty good. I don't recommend to come here during summer time: crowded. I just don't like that they don't provide a family changing room. I had my 6 months old baby at the time and 2 y.o. We had a hard time to \u2026",
          "Best place to spend half an hour after a 3 hour hike in the mountains.",
          "Not the largest hot springs pool out there, and not the most organic, but it's a lovely place to visit. Highly suggest visiting early in the day, as the parking lot can get pretty crowded, and you might end up parking down the road quite a \u2026",
          "Great hot springs filled with natural water. Amazing price . Incredible views.",
          "One of my best experience during my vacation was chilling in a hot spring while snowing. Very memorable indeed and amazing. Place was crowded with tourist. Parking was an issue but despite of this, i still recommend. This is a must visit \u2026",
          "Loved it here! A very fair entry fee, and with it we got to soak in the spring and enjoy the incredible view of the mountains in front of us. We didn't want to leave!",
          "Fantastic service. Very clean facilities and very nice staff. I had messed up with the lockers and the employee was nice enough to give me a new locker token no charge. Has a bathing suit dryer in the locker rooms and has beautiful scenery.",
          "Beautiful. You can get there by bus. Easy, easy. They are on Mountain Avenue, four kilometres south of the town of Banff. Public transit available by taxi and Banff Roan transit service.\n\n\ud83d\udc46The top five minerals found here:\n\nSulfate, calcium, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium. So healthy. Enjoy it.",
          "These \"hot springs\" is just a tiny overcrowded pool. Parking takes forever and getting out takes even longer. Not worth it",
          "You can rent necessities like swim wear. Fun and relaxing place to spend time. It also is comfortable in the winter!",
          "This hot spring is very overated.  Yes the view is nice but unfortunately it lacks options.  There is a single hot pool at one temperature.  We have been to multiple different hot springs and bath houses and it does not compare at all. \u2026",
          "Definitely a place to visit during your stay in Banff.\n\nAmazing view with a +40 C water while it's +2 outside and snowing.\nReasonable prices for service, as well as you can rent towels and bathing suite, which is fantastic! \nThere was no a \u2026",
          "Nice springs but just one pool and no cold pool.",
          "We went around 8pm and it was still relatively crowded - but not so much that it was too much of a bother.\nThe water was great after a long day of hiking - definitely help the sore feet!\nI can imagine this place being amazing in the winter \u2026",
          "Great place to relax in a hot pool surrounded by the mountains.  Free locker token with admission.  Parking can be a challenge on busy days/times.  You can drop off people at the top and there are a few handicapped spots available by the entrance.",
          "Too busy and too much chlorine in the water. Denaturalized. But good temperature and still nice view.",
          "It's a nice place in the winter! It gets pretty cold standing outside, but the water is actually warm enough to make you feel hot, and want to go back out for a bit!\nIt's a little expensive for what it is. Aside from the novelty of swimming \u2026",
          "It was very hot- 40 Very relaxing with a peaceful mountain top virw.. Made my skin so soft. Feels like it healed my sunburn also. Careful getting out. Ease out gently as can make your head very light. Drink plenty of fluids. Water taps on site.",
          "Good hot springs. Well organized. Not too expensive. However, if you want a more private experience, this is not it. The hot springs is in a large pool.",
          "Very relaxing!  Price was reasonable (approx $8 per person), not too crowded (we were there late morning on a Tuesday), the pool was clean and was a good temperature.  Lockers provided with admission.",
          "Nice place still. Beautiful warm water in nice cool conditions. They didnt smell that bad this time either.",
          "One of the most beautiful places I have visited.",
          "Relaxing but the facility is in need of an upgrade. Beautiful view regardless!",
          "Huge disappointment. My wife and I had such high expectations for this. It's just a simple pool. Nothing magical about the water, nothing special at all.\nThe place was packed and full (around 8:30pm) almost 210 people in a tiny pool. \nIt's \u2026",
          "The line was very long and slow. The elevator malfunctioned when we took MIL and my special needs guy back up to the main floor. There was VERY little on the Springs significance to the Original People who used this place (and maybe still \u2026",
          "Amazing time as always! Very relaxing.",
          "Worth a quick look if you are going to the Banff Gondola. There's an old spring (that smells of sulphur) and the hot springs swimming pool that was busy when we went to look.\n\nThere is a cafe and probably the most expensive ice creams I had during my trip to Canada",
          "Nice spot, a little crowded during the in season but very nice surprise that locker rentals are included.  Forgot a towel? No problem you can rent one and ot isnt insanely priced.",
          "Amazing! Can't imagine coming here any other time of year.",
          "Water is so warm and revitalizing \ud83d\ude4f would recommend for only 9$. And the views are just spectacular!",
          "Crowded even after 9pm..walking barefoot in the locker room was a little unnerving..bring flip flops if you have them, they dont allow street shoes in the locker room..It looked like Disney world by the door except instead of strollers \u2026",
          "A family favourite, easy to get to, great prices and amazing view. Change rooms are clean, staff are attentive. Water is the perfect temperature and a great place to relax.",
          "These hotsprings can get very busy but a trip is a must when in Banff. Pro tip- buy a ticket for the gondola, (right next to the hotsprings) head up to the viewpoint, watch the sunset and the way down the gondola is free after 7pm. Perfect time to relax and hit the hot springs",
          "Decent experience. It was a rainy day when I went and it really made for a nice end to the evening. Admission price was reasonable. They do have towels to use and they charge a nominal fee. I would definitely recommend bringing some shower \u2026",
          "Love it here! Beautiful scenery, amazing views, spotless facilities, excellent service. It is a smaller hot springs compared to Radium or Fairmont. It fills up quickly even in the summer months and I recommend getting there early. Enjoy your visit.",
          "Relax in the springs and enjoy the mountains. I always come here after a day of skiing",
          "Decently priced. The springs are interesting, but the pool you get into certainly isn't completely natural, as it's heated more and treated with bromine. Still an excellent place to relax",
          "Love it on a cool day. It was 55 and rainy. But rain stopped when we go here. Awesome time.",
          "Very nice place to visit after a day of hiking. Relaxing. Nice view of mountains. \nUnfortunately very small, no swimming lanes, no slides, no jacuzzi. \nJust one note for the owners - invest in lockers. Use some newer technology to allow people return to their stuff more than once",
          "natural hot spring with very good price , great mountain view",
          "Soak in the natural hot springs with beautiful views and feel amazing when you come out. Inexpensive and easy to get to using transit. Keep your towel at home and just get one there. Lockers are free. Bring a water bottle.",
          "Crowded but served its purpose to help me relax.  Locker didn't work but I found the cleaning lady and she got my tolen back and I moved to a working locker.\nCost me $10.50 for entry with a rented towel and a token for the locker.  Fairly \u2026",
          "We had complimentary passes here from buying ski passes.  We felt quite rejuvenated after 2 days of skiing after spending an hour or so in the hot springs.  The view was decent.  However, I would highly recommend those who have the time to \u2026",
          "This was a major highlight for me along our road trip, and it is definitely a must see stop for anyone travelling through.  It is pretty crowded so we went early in the day.  Even then it was pretty busy even then it was still quite \u2026",
          "Very nice hot springs.  Relaxing",
          "Truthfully, I enjoyed myself but I was expecting more. There was one large hot tub but it seemed like just a hot tub rather than the hot springs I was imagining (it would have been super cool if they made it look like the cave at cave & \u2026",
          "You get free access with a 3 day or longer 3-area ski pass.\n\nTraditional hot springs. Even though it\u2019s old, it doesn\u2019t give you a dated feeling. Everything is clean. Pool is not too large, so on busy days make sure you arrive before 18:00 \u2026",
          "Great activity if the weather is bad. However, there is only 1 pool so it can fill up. The pool did have a gradient of very shallow to deeper parts of the pool which is nice. \n\nYou do get a locker with your entrance but you can only unlock it once otherwise you have to pay.",
          "Loved the warm water! Especially when its abit chilly out. Place is sanitary, and kept pristine. Staff are great, and visitors, travellers, or residents are a pleasure to chat with in the hot springs. You HAVE to stoo here.",
          "Think of it as a well-maintained, inexpensive, hot tub ... I didn't get a whiff of any minerals, but then you have to be a special kind of person to sit in hot water sniffing sulfur fumes as I would expect in a real hot spring. I see the \u2026",
          "Great atmosphere but can get a bit crowded on weekends, plus very limited parking, car pool if you can!",
          "This place was super cool. The view is amazing and the facilities were clean. I love the swimsuit dryer they have! I only wish this was not a pool set up.",
          "I love coming here when on vacation. I suggest to bring flip flops for the poolside and bring a towel when you go. You can rent a swim suit if you need to.",
          "Natural hot springs in the Rockies with a perfect view of surrounding mountains.  How much better could it be?  Parks Canada staff was friendly and helpful.  Change rooms were spotless. Close enough to Banff one could easily hike.  Just spectacular all around.",
          "Needs a good clean and renovation, basically a warm swimming pool full of kids spitting in it...!! Parking is a nightmare, save yourself $10 and don\u2019t bother! Much better things to do in Banff!!! Lifeguards spent there shift we were there messaging each other on Apple watches... not very discreetly!!",
          "Brilliant place to relax. Lovely cafe.",
          "It's un real. Look how beautiful.",
          "This place is nothing but a hot tub like in a hotel. This is not a natural hot spring. I would not recommend any one. If you decide to go there then take towel from your hotel.",
          "This was not what I was expecting to see. I thought it was caverns in the mountains not pools. But the water was stimulating and relaxing.  I felt so good when I got out because if thunder storm.",
          "To quote Captain Holt in Brooklyn Nine Nine -- \"Never go to Banff.\" \n\nDon't get me wrong Banff is beautiful place -- but, it's all incredibly touristy. Very little about the place feels authentic. The Hot Springs could not be clearer \u2026",
          "Really nice experience and very relaxing.",
          "Very reasonably priced for one of Canada\u2019s greatest natural attractions",
          "A great & relaxing experience. Especially after a very full day. This is the best way to end any day!!",
          "OMG...perfect for relaxing..will be back again & again",
          "Great place to relax those aching bones and muscles! Water was 39degrees during our visit, wish it's a bit warmer like 42degrees!",
          "The hot springs were absolutely amazing. The views spectacular, the water is nice and warm. Shame our trip was cut short by a \"human biological incident\" which cleared the pool.",
          "Nice little facility with a long line to get in but eventually you get to wonderfully hot pool. The hot springs is fairly well kept up, clean and with very friendly staff. The woman at the counter said their rental swimwear is actually \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Highly recommended",
          "Best thing about this place is the view. Another place that you should probably strike off your checklist in Banff. The only issue is the size of the pool which makes it crowded with less seating. You'll still feel relaxed after visiting though! It's a hot spring, what can go wrong?",
          "Nice place with a good view. Kind of crowded in evening hours but that\u2019s not a big problem. One big pool with separated small area for babies.",
          "Always have had a good time here, issues every once in a while just like everywhere else",
          "Great hot springs, very busy during the summer time. Can rent towels and bathing suits there if needed. Staff is very accommodating.",
          "The venue was beautiful however the customer services was not great.",
          "We love this place! Quiet and warm!",
          "Great view. This place gets extremely busy on weekends and holidays though, so you may have to prepare to wait in line for up to 45 minutes. If the line is out the door - more like an hour.",
          "We had a great experience today. Bilingual staff at front desk, not crowded, easily affordable outing for 2 adults. Children also welcome but its more of a relaxing atmosphere so expect no jumping around. Lockers available.",
          "A little crowded and only a single pool.  The locker situation is a bit shady as the coins only work once and the first few lockers tried didn't lock.  Pool felt great though after almost 2 weeks of nearly 50 miles and of hikes, so definitely still worth it.",
          "Was closed and there was nothing on the website or phone msg and we drove from Calgary just to find this out",
          "Amazing place to come after skiing or snowboarding. Definitely makes you feel relaxed. Best time to go is probably after 8pm when it's not so busy. They provide you with one locker token per person to use to rent a locker with each \u2026",
          "a good view and temperature and a quality souvenir shop",
          "Great experience, only complain was: the locker is not clean enough, some hair on the floor. Other than that, keep it up",
          "Great place to relax. Come here during morning as around late afternoon it get busy.",
          "Very nice and clean pool. Just wish that you were able to eat beside the pool, this is not the case so do not bring a lunch!",
          "Always enjoy going here, is great to spend a few hours just relaxing in the water and enjoying such amazing views",
          "The best $8 you'll ever spend! My friends and I like to drive out to the hot springs and hang out on a cool winter or spring evening. They're open late, and close enough to Calgary that you can drive there and back without having to stay over. So relaxing!",
          "So nice. So hot. Relaxing. Beautiful view. Terrible parking.",
          "It's such an incredible spot. The views are amazing and if you go early enough you'll get an amazing spot!",
          "The Banff Upper Hot Springs is one of the oldest tourist attractions in the Banff area. The warm pool is best in fall and winter in my opinion. With a max depth of 1.6 metres and a temp 40 C, this is an experience you can bring your kids along for.",
          "Awesome place for families. Great to relax after a busy day of hiking.",
          "I went there with my girlfriend to warm up a little bit after a hike. I think it's a good place to go to when weather is cold in Banff.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that entrance was only 8.50$.\n\nI would advise not to go there around 3pm \u2026",
          "So relaxing! And the feeling of being under snow while in the pool is so good!",
          "SERENITY. and to cook like a lobster \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Good water temperature. A little too crowded.",
          "It is a very relaxing hot spot, with a nice view.",
          "It was crowded, but everyone was using pool etiquette so it wasn't that bad. The water was nice and hot and the mountains were outstanding! A perfect outing for my son's birthday ^_^",
          "Just get over the fact that Banff is a touristy place.  Once you can do that, it is a beautiful place!  It is a national treasure.  The history of the building and area is fascinating.  It is like a throwback in time.  Water temps around \u2026",
          "This was free trip. Would not pay to go. Nice and hot but view was spoilt by lots of yellow and black tape everywhere",
          "Amazing place to relax and enjoy the views.",
          "In Feb, me and my husband spent our anniversary and Valentine week in Banff. We were at the hot spring everyday for full week and bought the 10 tickets for 10%discount. We like the Banff vs the radium because the temperature was hotter. \u2026",
          "Came here, got wet, relaxed.\n\nIt does get busy and the water gets full quick.\n\nGo early in the morning or in the last hour, during the day it's peaked and just too full",
          "Love it, clean, view is awesome, facility is well established.  Very cheap price, swimsuit and towel rental available.  Parking is a bit far and full, but fine.",
          "Nice hot water spring. We visited in the summer, but it should be nice in winter too.",

          "It was quite exquisite! Soooo relaxing and very organized! Beautiful place \ud83d\ude0c",

          "Love this place ,can get pritty busy at times",
          "It was a nice and relaxing environment with a beautiful view of the mountains to look at while you soak in a hot pool. Great for after snowboarding too. I see why it is so popular, and i appreciate that it is a fair price as well.",
          "Was super relaxing! A little busy for my liking with the size but you could still have a little of your own space. It was my first time so I don't have anything to compare it to.\n Nice that there's a bit more of a \"kid\" side and an \"adult\" \u2026",
          "This is sort of overrated it\u2019s just like a public swimming pool full of children. But rented a swimsuit and it was comfortable.",
          "Time to expand.. love it there. Even tho it was super busy last visit I was able to zone out and unwind.",
          "Nice place to visit. Can get very busy and parking is not adequate. Facilities are top notch",
          "Great pool area for the family very well priced",
          "Fun activity to take a break from the snow!  The hot springs are definitely hot!  While beautiful views, keep in mind this is a man made pool and not a natural pool.  But it's an inexpensive and fun activity to break up all the snow!",
          "Parking is currently limited because of construction. Because of the exceptionally fair price (entry is less than $9 for adults), I am still giving 5 stars. \n\nThe pool is extremely relaxing, and there is quite a bit of beautiful scenary. \u2026",
          "Such a well maintained hot springs! The water is HOT! Such a fun thing to do in the winter! I would definitely go again. It's also very nice to share in a tried and true Canadian experience. The hot springs are why banff exists.",
          "COZY,COMFORTABLE ,RELAXING AND MINIMAL RATES. DONT MISS IT ON YOUR VISIT TO BANFF",
          "Priced well compared to everything else in the area, not the best view in the world, but still very nice, and definitely worth it!",
          "A must if you\u2019re visiting Banff! I was there in September, so had to get out every 10 minutes or I\u2019d feel woozy. It was so nice and relaxing... the view was spectacular too!",
          "Very relaxing and soothing. We went at night and the chill in the air with the steam floating around just added to the experience! One of the more cost effective activities in Banff that definitely should not be missed! Don't worry if you didn't pack swimwear, they have it available. Highly recommended.",
          "A staple during a visit to Banff and a great place to relax and take in a nice view.\n\nSuitable for people of all ages, these hot springs are enjoyable and affordable, the facilities are well looked after, and the history is rich.\n\nWhen \u2026",
          "The views are cool, but you can get views anywhere in Banff. The pool itself is underwhelming to say the least. It's just an overpriced hot swimming pool, not much bigger than a hotel swimming pool.",
          "Best experience.. \ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",
          "Beautiful view. Very relaxing, although the water isn't currently from the springs because the spring was dry when we went. So any therapeutic benefits are all in my head!",
          "Busy place but line moved quickly.  Pool is not very large and I thought it might be too crowded but it was fine. Everyone was pretty mindful of each other's personal space.\n\nReasonably priced, ample parking.  Great way to relax and break from hectic travel schedule.  Loved the way my skin felt afterward too!",
          "Very warm. Nice pool.",
          "Great communal pool with good views but would recommend miette hot springs instead for a less crowded experience.",
          "Great experience and pleasant staff. The hot springs were busy, but it wasn't unpleasant. I only with there was a better means of storing your towel so that you had it right away when you got out, rather than walking slowly behind other people in the freezing cold air.",
          "Absolutely stunning views. The hot springs were packed at night time, no room to even move. I suggest going midday or early afternoon!",
          "My entire family had an amazing day here. Very affordable. Fantastic View. The gentleman at the entry desk was polite, friendly and had a great sense of humor. We will definitely be back.",
          "Went in the evening, and it was fairly busy! I understand it was during New year's Eve (Eve) and lots of people were visiting. We got to go inside in under 20 minutes, so overall it was good! Just didn't have any seats in the hot springs itself.",
          "Great break if you're driving through Banff! Take a half hour to relax. Keep in mind that certain times of the year it's just a big hit tub because the hot springs aren't running.",
          "This place would be great, in the 1800's.",
          "Currently using city tap water. Pretty small. Go if the weather is bad and there is nothing else to do or in need of a shower or a warm up.",
          "Really nice for a good weather day. Good price with awesome view. Must visit.",
          "This place. Amazing experience. If I lived in the area I'd have a frequent flyer card :)",
          "The view is amazing, yet the pool is too small for the amount of people you find there usually.",
          "Came all the way from Hamilton Ontario to experience it ....speachless...",
          "Busy, but soothing, the colder the ambient air temp, the better the experience.",
          "Beautiful scenery, water the perfect temp and we'll needed at end of day after lots of walking ;_ slept well after :)",
          "Very nice place, warm water (around 42 degrees of Celsius), nice facility. Very close to Banff",
          "It is absolutely worth going ($8) but usually too crowded.",
          "I was impressed with the pricing at the upper hot springs! Locker tokens are included with entry.\n\nI would recommend coming before dark so you can enjoy the views, and check out the sunset. \n\nThe pool is on the smaller side and can tend to \u2026",
          "Nice Hot Springs,   however very busy!!  155 people in the Hot Springs and we were there at 8 pm at night.  Awesome views.",
          "This is a nice, large hot pool. It's generally less busy earlier in the day, after the ski hills close, the line up to get in can stretch out the door, and a parking spot can be hard to come by. It is terrific for relaxing those tense muscles though!",
          "We enjoyed stopping here after our day adventures. We went in the off season so it wasn\u2019t crowded.",
          "Great experience! Must come with Patience but worth the wait.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Must enjoy hot spring water with sulfur",
          "Very nice view and wonderful 40deg water",
          "Too many people   Didn\u2019t have enough parking. And the pool looks like a swimming pool",
          "Fun and relaxing experience anytime of the year!",
          "Clean! On point lifeguards and great service!",
          "This is a good place to go after a loooong tiring day. Let the minerals of the hot spring water melt your stress away. \nThe cons: crowded and parking can be a hassel. We got lucky on that.",
          "Right on the mountain top along the side you get to experience a hot water pool amidst the cold snowy surroundings in Winter. You get to vote the beautiful Mountains and the Sun sometimes greets you as well. It's a perfect blend of nature's beautiful landscape coupled with hot springs.",
          "Go early to avoid the crowds. Even on week days this place fills up before 12. It's a massive hot tub essentially filled with tourists. With that being said the water is really enjoyable and leaves you feel like a jelly fish for hours after leaving.",
          "If you like hot tubs, great views, and musical chairs this place is perfect you. Just make sure when you see a spot open quiet literally sprint to it because if not in 5 seconds flat that spot is gone!",
          "Beautiful area.  We were only passing through and didn't stay.",
          "Well managed facility,  friendly service and an outstanding experience. An early morning visit was calm and pleasant.",
          "Location is awesome.... You get very nice view from the pool",
          "I'll put 3 stars since it was bananas busy.  The parking is at the bottom of the hill and P.S never go during the holidays lol.",
          "I unfortunately do not have a picture, however we have visited the hot springs in Banff for years. Our last four visits during 2016-2018 haven\u2019t been great. It is very over crowded and nothing has been updated in years. The water is not the \u2026",
          "Great place to stop by if you want to chill in a hot spring. Good for all seasons",
          "Nice and clean natural hot spring pool. Priced a little on the steep side .",
          "It is an overly priced, community pool size hot tub. \nYou do not smell sulfur, instead its chlorine you smell. \nThere are kids next to you snorkeling and adults spitting out water as they swim across. \nAnd also people picking their nose and \u2026",
          "One of the best views in all of Banff and a great place to soak the stress away \ud83d\udc4c",
          "If you're going on a weekend it's going to be busy so keep that in mind. Very relaxing once you get in. The queue management to process payment was pretty poor though as they had one till open to process upwards of 30 people.",
          "The view is nice! Do remember to bring you own towels because there is rental fee for towels.",
          "Hot! A little crowded on winter weekend",
          "Love it!...but i think pool is shrinking for the amount of people that visit it.",
          "Very reasonable,  and they provide rental of swimming suit and towels if you forget one.  I have sore legs after all these trails and now I can take on the next one.",
          "The swimming pool here is nice and hot. Administration is really easy to follow. Change rooms have easy access to the pool it's self. At the pool has a beautiful view of the Rockies. Next time we'll  bring everyone else with me.",
          "We really like coming here. Our daughter loved it. A bit crowded but we don't mind.",
          "It was nice, but not enough seating areas, also it was really hot during the hot day/evening",
          "Great place to visit. Best to stay for a few days to get the best out of your visit.",
          "Inexpensive and always relaxing despite the fact it\u2019s generally pretty packed. You really cant beat the view either. It\u2019s one of my favourite things to do on a trip to Banff or coming back from the ski hills.",
          "You must need to visit there at least one in a lifetime",
          "What's not to like about a Hot Springs with wonderful hot springs water and spectacular mountain views and only $8.30 for an adult to get in?!",
          "Very hot about 40 degrees C.",
          "Hmmm.. when you hear \u201chot springs\u201d you would assume it is actually natural, but this is just a hot swimming pool filled with tourists and stinks of chlorine.",
          "Just such a great place to relax.",
          "Really nice place , clean and cheap to chill for a few hrs with friend and family !",
          "The staff is always polite and helpful and the hot springs are always hot and relaxing. Highly suggest taking a weekend trip and hanging out up here if you're looking for some much needed relaxation.",
          "Went early, not too many people. Very relaxing",
          "One of the best places to relax in Banff national park. Natural Hot Springs in a cold winter day. +40 degrees water temperature in -20 degrees day. It's worth visiting",
          "Love this place.  So relaxing and refreshing.  Mountain air and beautiful scenery to enjoy while soaking in the hot water.  Definitely something to do while in Banff.  Gets busier towards later afternoon and evening.  Love an early time when the pool is relatively empty.",
          "Great hot springs. Can be a little crowded at times.",
          "Relax....it's time to ease your self to recovery... Stay till 11pm",
          "Wouldn\u2019t want to go if it was overly crowded but the water was amazing, very relaxing",
          "Is just a heated pool the view is very nice they might want to remodel THE POOL and make it look part of the nature.",
          "A great way to finish off a long day off hiking. Don't expect too much by way of beautiful decor, this is a simple old establishment that provides access to the mountain hot springs of Banff. At$7 per person is well worth the price of admission",
          "Well organised facility allowing plenty of people to enjoy the warm spring waters.",
          "The hot springs in Banff are fantastic. The locker rooms are spotless, the price is low, the view is great and the water is always hot. I will not fault them for being so busy during holidays, but do be warned it does get busy. If you go on a quiet weekday night, it\u2019s impossible to not love these hot springs.",
          "I wished the water was warmer. Nice view from the pool.",
          "Looks like a large hot tub. Would be nice to make it looked more nature.",
          "This place is awsssm you can rent everything here",
          "Warmer than the hot tub at our hotel. Hot lifeguards too",
          "So relaxing!!! I didnt want to leave !",
          "Mountain views with naturally heated spring water. Entrance fee gets you a free locker coin for your stuff.",
          "Easy to find. Well organized. My back feels great after a good soak!!!",
          "This place was fantastic after a long day of winter hiking. The changing area can be crowded but was clean and we'll organized. Even though it was -19degC the day we were there and joked about the mad dash from the changing room to the \u2026",
          "Good to visit because there is no competitive place around.",
          "It was busy as heck,  but still very enjoyable. Wish they would make the hot springs bigger. But definitely will be coming back.",
          "Banff hot springs is always super busy during early evenings so I tend to go before it closes around 9:30-10pm and it is just lovely. Less people, water is perfect and the night sky just makes it magical.",
          "Beautiful place and fantastic experience. Unmissable if you visit Banff",
          "Relaxed and well maintained hot spring reasonable price",
          "Nice space to come recharge mind, body and soul. Beautiful view of the landscape too. Thank you for keeping this place so well maintained",
          "I am from calgary about an hour away, I should take advantage of this beautiful place a lot more that's for sure. Everything is awesome except the water is dirty. I suppose the place is always full so cleaning would be a challenge.",
          "What an amazing place to come relax and hang out with your family or friends or after a long day of hiking. This is one of the warmest if not the hottest hot spring originating from Sulphur Moutain. Hot springs if what Banff was originally \u2026",
          "We came to check it out but there were too many people swimming so we decided not to go. Small hot springs. The view was beautiful though! Lots of parking.",
          "Fantastic place to relax the waters and the minerals really relax your muscles we went in the evening it wasn't very busy. Well worth the price paid the locker rooms and the showers are clean. Plenty of lockers and storage space. As well as closed off change stahl's if you wish to use something like that.",
          "Cool experience, crowded but still nice.",
          "One of my favorite places on earth. There is nothing better after a cold day in the mountains than to go soak in the hot springs. Relieves all pains in the body and soul!",
          "It had been years since our last visit. We enjoyed a great 1 hour soak in the hot springs while looking up at the beautiful Rocky Mountains. Very well maintained and clean facility. I found the price to be very reasonable at 9.30 each including towel and locker.",
          "The hot springs are fantastic. It gets very busy and it's not uncommon to wait to get in. They ask that you remove your shoes at the entry to the change rooms but half of the people do not respect this so the floors can be very dirty. I \u2026",
          "Beautiful place , went on the gondola ride close by wonderful view! Stayed at the Rimrock Hotel close to here, again beautiful, everything around here is perfect.",
          "The truffle fries are unlike any other- the taste is in every bite. Great burgers and then poutine was killer. Can't wait to come back",
          "Best place to spend your money in Banff! We enjoyed thoroughly!",
          "A simple, classic stop if you're spending time in Canmore or Banff area. Family friendly environment that you can soak away your worries in. Perfect after some hiking, biking, or rock climbing to relax the muscles.",
          "Amazing view, clean and hot water, friendly staff and easy system. They give you one locker each for free which is nice! There are cold showers to step into if you get too warm in the hot springs. Towels and bathing suits are easy to rent \u2026",
          "Hot days, cold days, rainy days, snowy days.  Every day is better with a dip in the hot springs!",
          "Underwhelming. Crowded, loud and basically just feels like a hot pool. If you're in the area, maybe check it out, but don't go out of your way. One plus was the friendly staff",
          "There should be a limit of people allowed. Last time I went there, I was very disappointed. It was so packed, there was bunch of hair in the water and the water was so oily and disgusting. This experience is totally not worth sitting next to hundreds of people in a very unsanitary water/environment.",
          "I have never tried a hot spring before. It was wonderful very relaxing.",
          "After hiking Sulphur Mountain using old fire road (west/south flank) and using Gondola for descent, we stopped at the springs for a well deserved relaxation moment. \n\nThe pool isn't deep, you can't swim in it, it's more like a 19th century \u2026",
          "Very nice thermal pool with impressive sights of the mountain range. Everything was neat and clean. Sadly, someone stole my towel, and the only answer the staff gave me was to pay for a new one. If only they would have helped with the sour moment instead of charging me an extra 2 bucks. Almost 5 stars.",
          "Enjoyable, however, it would have been a better experience if it was set up to look like it was in a more natural setting. As it is, it looks and feels like you are in a giant hot tub.",
          "This place has a pretty cozy pool if you like hot tubs.",
          "Nice view to much chimical in the water not a hot spring any more.",
          "Nice pool for a quick jump in the hot tub.  Reasonably priced and some good views of Mt Rundle and Sulphur Mountain.",
          "There is no trust such as the fee for use at check-in and the additional fee at check-out.",
          "Very relaxing.  Very warm on a sunny day! Great views",
          "For being so close to Calgary, this is nice place to visit. Always a hot temperature and relaxing. Being Banff, it's a bit pricey getting into the park and doing anything there, but there's lots of parking and a bit of an international vibe \u2026",
          "This is a spring fed outdoor pool much like you'd find in a hotel or apartment block. The water was 39C so think of it as an oversized jacuzzi. There are separate changing facilities with lockers which are a doller for every time you lock \u2026",
          "The pool was really crowded but well maintained. However, the washrooms could be cleaned more often.",
          "It's always nice to sit.in hot springs but this place is getting a little long in the tooth.   We wanted to take a shower before entering the pool but there was kot hot or eben warm water.   It was freezing cold.\nDon't forget anything in you locker\n...it'll cost you another token to lock it.",
          "It was really nice. Water was 39\u00b0C when we were there. Park in Banff and take the bus up as parking is a nightmare.",
          "Must go place.  They have towels and swimming trunks too.",
          "It is a very nice place kind of a hassle to get to it for traffic-wise but if you have the patience to get through it it is an  awesome View and very relaxing",
          "A nice, small pool. Brutal over-head sun during the middle of the day, however, and an excess of loud, pushy international tourists. Needs a shady spot to be really pleasant.",
          "It is a pretty great place. The 7 thousand other people who were there seemed to think so too.",
          "Great place for cold winter",
          "Very popular place and there were a lot of people in the group pool with you. I would suggest if you want more peace and solitude to go on off hours but it was still a great experience even with all the people and the lock rooms are super \u2026",
          "If you go to Banff try to visit the hot springs on a cold day.  We've been there at night, which is an amazing experience, with snow coming down, in the pouring rain, and I like it best when you can get chilly and really feel the water when you go back in.\nStaff are always great and the views are outstanding.",
          "Natural Hot springs in form of water fall and artificial hot swim bath",
          "Its hot water... the mountains around make it more scenic but its just a pool. In winter time you can soak it for a while but as soon as you get out you need to dress up and leave. There is nothing to lay down and relax for a while.",
          "Wonderful place to visit in Banff. Even more recommended when it is cold/snowing or after a hike to the top of Sulphur Mountain. Fairly priced. Great staff. Open until 11pm any day of the week.",
          "Beautiful hot natural hot springs, specially great place to visit and relax in a cold days.",
          "I visit this location with few friends of mine and it was their recommendation. We were staying in the hot spring for few hours and it did not feel like a few hours stay. It went by quickly and next thing I know we had to grab lunch. Do \u2026",
          "It was a big outdoor hot tub, with a sort of funny smell - not really anything special.  There's no view from the pool area & the water wasn't even as hot as the tub at my hotel in town.  Wish I'd saved the $15 (each way) taxi fee and just stayed at the hotel hot tub in town.",
          "2 hour line up... couldnt wait for that",
          "Meh. Crowded pool, not super exciting. Weird outdated patio with weird food and drink choices, cash only (why though?). Their alcohol choices were for a college student from 2002. Pretty views but I would never go back.",
          "WONDERFUL to be in the hot springs, always. 50/50 chance on friendliness of staff. Its typically packed and many people don't handle the crowd, though some type of control by management would be nice. Best to visit in winter in my opinion. Big change rooms, usually clean and I like that it has the machine to spin dry a wet bathing suit.",
          "Nice and family friendly place. May be it is too popular that they put a bit of bleach into the sprung. If they can lower the bleach level in the pool, it will be much better.",
          "Everything goes right like service, supplies, facilities, price, overall quality. Environment & view are excellent as it's surrounded by Rockies.",
          "It's great when you go later in the day, cause then they're less people there and you can actually move around the spring. It's really nice that you don't have to walk around outside in the cold cause you enter the water before going outside.",
          "It beautiful place and you can see the mountains \u2665\ufe0f",
          "Great views. Nice hot spring  pool but crowded. Long wait to pay to get in.",
          "Nice staff and well kept pool. Watch out their lockers use a one use coin system!",
          "A classic. Still one of the best views. Always hot. No bad smells. Rental suits and towels. My only issue is the wet floor in the change rooms and no one enforcing the\"remove your shoes\" at the door to the change rooms - yuck. But still a bargain.",
          "Spent almost a day there...very beautiful and pool is very hot...nice place to relax",
          "Always go here when visiting banff. It can be a little busy but after a long day of hike and walk. It is worth wait and price is very reasonable.",
          "We went to this place 1st after driving 13 hours from Portland and it was the right decision. A quick shower and a short break in hot spring water definitely help you recover from long driving. RV parking was easy and I recommend doing this \u2026",
          "We went on a cold rainy day and it was perfect after our trail ride. It is crowded though in the late afternoon. The price is very reasonable also.",
          "A nice little spot if not too busy...keep in mind that they charge you for a towel rental but provide a token for a locker. We did not use one so I'm note sure of the size. Probably has a total 40 chairs so seating is at a premium with \u2026",
          "Wonderful! Beautifully warm and not too many people. Note: Parking lot under construction, so please have patience. The only disruption at this time was playing musical parking spaces.",
          "Beautiful location but it's just looks and feels too much like a pool",
          "I loved my experience at the hotsprings. It was so fun to go in winter and have the mist freeze all around us. The prices are incredibly reasonable for a beautiful rocky mountain hotsprings experience. I will definitely go again in the future. But a tip would be to bring a bottle of water and snack for after",
          "Always my favorite spot to go",
          "I've read fun stuff about the history and the touting of the waters as miraculously Curative. But I have to admit, both of our joints ached much less after steeping in the mineral-rich water",
          "Great view, appropriate temperature,  quick service , clean bathrooms and showers.",
          "Feeel soo fresh after very nice view",
          "Popular destination as it is an easily accessable hot spring from Calgary. Try to plan ahead as parking can get pretty busy during holidays and long weekends",
          "Amazing place. Was very busy and had to wait one hour but was worth it.",
          "Very busy but interesting place to hang out at for a couple hours",
          "Didn\u2019t get to experience it due to how long the line was to just get in. When looking in we saw how packed the hot springs were. Looked beautiful and a decently big size body of water about a pool size. Too many people for s small place.",
          "The Springs was quite busy, and the parking lit didn't have adequate space to accommodate the mass of people. The line was also very long to get into the springs, probably a half hour. Overall, the springs were good but the parking and waiting was poor.",
          "Place is too crowded to enjoy the water. Showers and lockers are okay.",
          "The change rooms are small, hallways are tight, there are limited showers and there\u2019s only one pool. However, the floors are clean, there\u2019s plenty of lockers, the washrooms are clean, the showers work well, the pool is clean and the price \u2026",
          "The hot springs was great after an tiring day of walking over the frozen lake Louise.\nThough, the spring has stopped working. It artificially heated.",
          "One of the best places in Canada , must see once in a life time",
          "The hot springs is in a beautiful location with a view of the mountains on a clear day. You can Rent Everything you need including bathing suiIt and towel so this is still a great option if you didn't bring those along. It is an outdoor \u2026",
          "A nice place to stay and relax, just the line-up for the admission was really slow. Anyways is tourist area so we need put in mind a lot people want to try it too. The hot springs is an amazing place to chill, clear your mind. I definitely \u2026",
          "The Bannf Upper Hot Springs pool was enjoyable for the most part, the only drawback was the high school gym style shower and changing area.",
          "Beautiful place must visit to see sulphur mountains",
          "Beautiful setting for a soak in a natural hot springs pool",
          "It's a heated pool from the 70s",
          "Busy but good for relaxing",
          "Such a nice relaxing place!",
          "Great place to relax after a long day of hiking with the family. Kids are welcome and if you've forgotten towels or a swimsuit you can rent some there for a couple bucks!",
          "Facility and staff were great. You can rent towels or a swimsuit for $1.90. Beautiful at night with a gentle snow falling.",
          "It is just a kidney shaped cement pond that they charge you to go into. Views are ok. Drove 3+ hours because of a birthday request and we could have stayed home and used our hot tub.",
          "One of my most favourite places to go!  This place is so lovely.. The Hot springs are natural sulfer water..not to expensive.. Clean..really good locker rooms.. Space to change in privacy. They rent Swimsuits and Swimmers. Kid friendly very \u2026",
          "So wonderful. Perfect in any weather.\nWear whatever you'd like, bring your waterproof phone. Lots of fun.",
          "Adult charge $10.20 includes towel and locker. Water is always hot +40c. Great place to relax.",
          "Not what you expect for natural hot springs. Perhaps better during the day and you get to see the surrounding mountains. Avoid at nighttime, where you are literally just sitting in a 40C pool with a bunch of other tourists.",
          "Quiet. Relaxing. Entry to the changerooms and pool is well organized and quick.  There is little else to do other than soak or sit on the sides to cool down.  There are water fountains on the outside by the pool so you don't need to take a \u2026",
          "The view of hot pool is very beautiful. Road, snow, hot water, clean are positive point of this place.",
          "Was good. Not too busy around 10 A.M.",
          "This becomes a five star place if you go last hour before closing. At that time, the crowd is chill and kids aren\u2019t splashing.\n\nBoiled eggs make me puke, but the pool itself smelled like a faint perfect scrambled egg salted with chlorine.\n\nEverybody that goes here enjoys life, I love it.",
          "Super relaxing great view",
          "Nice place to spend hour after hike, skiing or when you want to relax a bit. Tends to get very busy though, not very suitable for swimming.",
          "Nice place, but honestly far too busy for its size.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous. But doesn't seem very natural.",
          "This place is great! I\u2019m not sure if it is geothermal, but the water is a pleasantly warm temperature and lots of space to cool down if necessary. The pool is a decent size to accommodate a lot of people, but when we were there (9pm) it was still active with a few people. The price was awesome too. Great value and highly recommend!",
          "This place is amazing. \n\nGreat for kids and adults alike. It is pretty amazing to think about how this water is heated despite the smell. \n\nDefinitely worth the visit. It can get pretty busy though",
          "Nice . It was raining and cold when we went. So nice to be outside.",
          "It's not bad. It's actually a regular pool with heat from the hot springs. It's not the actually hot spring. \n\nThe view is great though.",
          "The place is super busy. While its affordable , the staff is not super friendly at all. I also observed a poor first aid training of one of the life guards, who kept on running back and forth to first get bandages and then to get the \u2026",

          "Serve is very good and convenient.",
          "Packed with people. Unsanitary change rooms. Doors missing in washrooms. Diapers left in the lockers. Cold water showers, half of which do not work. Heated tap water at this time of year. Perfect conditions to get warts under your feet! Avoid deception and drive to Radium Hot Springs.",
          "Interesting. Lots of people seemed to be enjoying themselves.",
          "Bring a hair dryer, they don't provide them anymore.  Must visit, affordable and clean place. Really good fun experience.",

          "Absolutely beautiful. Hot springs were fantastic to relax in. Inexpensive to visit. Loved it.",
          "Very crowded and small. Miette hot spring was much better, it was less crowded and had multiple pools.",
          "Great place a must stop!",
          "Could be less crowded. Hardly found a corner to sit. Was here around 7 on a Sunday, not sure if that's their peak. Gives more of a swimming pool hot tub feel but since this was my first hot spring experience I don't have a comparison to make.",
          "Classic bathing outfits for rental. Towel rental. Locker rental. Reasonable admission fee. Large pool man-made pool. Great view.",
          "Had an excellent time there really relaxing",
          "Such a relaxing experience, especially after a day out hiking and exploring the region on the bitter cold.  Bring your own towel to save a couple dollars, but they have lots there.",
          "Nice and relaxing but it feels a bit like a giant jacuzzi not a natural phenomenon. It's amazing at night though. There's a long line so prepare half an hour before when you want to get into the pool. Not terribly hot though, supposedly 39 deg",
          "Hot springs? A joke, its so crowded Even finding parking is laughable.\n\nIts just a warm pool, with About 1-2 ppl pr. Sqr. M.\n\nPersonally i find it disgusting",
          "Good location, just a few minute drive from downtown Banff. Change rooms are kept pretty clean, good lockers as well. Line ups can be long if you go later in the day/evening.",
          "Feels good to be in the pool when it's Snowing \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Always a must when visiting Banff. Spectacular in the winter time. Gets busy and change room could be more tidy, but that's people not following signage. J",
          "Beautiful location but it smells of Sulfur. The water is nice and hot in the Hot Springs, is temperature regulated and has a nice view while sitting outside. The indoor facilities charge around $6.30-$7.30 plus tax for entrance and change \u2026",
          "Awesome to relax. Cheap. It could be bigger but I recommend to visit :)",
          "This place is always busy, packed like sardines here. Whenever I visit it\u2019s usually over capacity. It\u2019s mixed in with adults and children, it\u2019s not a place to relax. Even sitting by the edge of the pool you\u2019ll get splashed by kids. Towel \u2026",
          "Always a Great destination had fun and relaxed",
          "Great place to warm up after watching sunset",
          "Amazing.  If ever in the area you have to stop in for a dip",
          "Very nice but also very busy....",
          "We had an absolutely wonderful time here! The prices are very reasonable and the pool so nice and clean and the temperature was great. We will be back again!",
          "Make sure have dip your body in BANFF UPPER HOT SPRING after long day travel around  ALBERTA",
          "I would strongly recommend to try it! The place is wonderful and relaxing! It is clean and organized, and The tickets are really cheap (about $8 per person). Note that you can also rent swimwear and towels.",
          "Good service and hot springs for given price. It was a little crowded in the pool due to many people come.",
          "This was a fun place to come with a group of friends after a day of hiking in Banff. It was relaxing and refreshing. One friend convinced us to rent the classic bathing suits, which we felt ridiculous wearing, but it made for fun memories. The hot springs did feel a little crowded, but we enjoyed it overall.",
          "Some of my favourite hot springs.",
          "It's a nice pool but it's between normal hot tub temperature and hot tub temperature.",
          "Beautiful view and hot water at a reasonable price.",
          "Definitely would visit again",
          "Very busy,but still nice hot water to relax in \ud83e\udd9e",
          "Go up the hill and park in the left lot. The hot water from the cave is piped into a large pool. Water temperature is around 40C. It's an amazing and relaxing experience. Recommend to go when the temperature outside is lower.",
          "Body and Mind Therapy on the next level. A place to visit and enjoy. Wonderful view point when your in the pool. The locker rooms are decent but nothing less of a college style one. 100% bring your own bathing suit. Towels provided for a few bux per pc. Very satisfying.",
          "Beautiful views! But it's just a big hot pool.",
          "Not bad if you like sharing a bathtub with 200 of your closest friends. The view is beautiful and the only reason to stop. You can rent an old fashioned bathing suit which is a nice touch.",
          "We had a most enjoyable visit at the hot springs \n\nUnfortunately it was cut a bit short by the thunder and lightning. Their policy is that they close for 30 minutes then reevaluate the weather conditions before re-opening.\n\nParks Canada offered a refund to those who didn't  want to wait for the weather to clear. \ud83d\ude0e",
          "The Upper Hot Springs is an experience you should not miss out on. However, it does get very crowded. We went around 5pm and stayed for about an hour and people just kept coming in.\n\nThings to considered, you can bring your own towel or \u2026",
          "Great for value as it's less than $10 CAD to visit but it's just one small pool. Literally that's it. Pretty uneventful compared to almost everything else in the area. Winter is better though as ice is forming everywhere from the steam. If \u2026",
          "Awesome place to visit in the earlier hrs. Gets a little busy mid afternoon. All togwther a nice visit..kid friendly",
          "Sometimes difficult to get parking, but it is a great hot springs in a beautiful location.",
          "Long line to get in, but COMPLETELY worth it. Locker rooms were clean, facilities well kempt. When leaving the locker room, an indoor tunnel with spring water leads to the outdoor pool, ensuring you're never caught out in the cold! Pool was \u2026",
          "Nice way to end the day in banff. Open until 11pm is a nice bonus.",
          "Great spot. Smaller than Radium Hot Springs, but perfect to unwind after a day of exploring the town.",
          "Nice relaxing hot spring...with the view of majestic snow mountains.",
          "Was really busy but worth it. Water was perfect temp. Helped after a week of hiking. Price was great ($8?). Facilities clean. Staff friendly. Would visit again. Just don\u2019t count on solitude :)",

          "Reasonable price and fun to people watch. Staff are always professional. Be prepared for the walk from the parking lot.",
          "I love these hot springs. This is a historical part of Banff that attracts locals and tourists from around the world. Very affordable and very relaxing. They can rent you bathing suits and towels if needed. Great all year round even in the middle of winter.",

          "I walked this easy 2km long trail during the summer of 2016 and it is very pretty. We have just come back from Christmas in Banff and I had the pleasure of walking this again but with everything draped in snow. It was simply beautiful. There is access to the Vermillion Lakes",

          "Having done lots of up hill hiking whilst on holiday in Canada the family appreciated a 40 minute walk on the flat! Lots of signs about bears but we didn't see any but we did see a woodpecker. Nice riverside woodland walk. Great choice on a hot day as most of the route is",
          "Enjoyed this walk away from the crowds and noise of Banff. Beautiful woodland along the stream. Squirrels to be seen but not many birds today",

          "An easy mostly flat loop. Still snow around when we went but could see the beauty of the walk starting to break through. The trail follows a stream which I've been told wildlife has been seen but we weren't lucky enough to see the day we were there.",

          "We visited this winter, short trail, probably nice in summer, but not much to do or see in the winter.",
          "Our first time. Winter day, cold. Fabulous ice formations on the river. Self guided trail: well done and informative. Looks like it is wheel chair accessible. Flat, 2km long.",
          "Fenland Trail is a nice easy walk any time of the year. There are pit toilets and picnic tables near the parking lot. The walk itself takes you through the forest and then along a stream. The trail is wide and quite flat. Strider bikes and strollers have no trouble using it.",
          "We took the baby in the large wheeled stroller along this well defined trail. The scenery was amazing with lakes surrounded by mountains and small bridges over the creeks feeding the lake.",
          "We're not sure if this one is a total all year short hike - but it's pretty close. There was a lot of packed snow on the trail (they don't clear it) when we were there, so when it melts in the spring, it could be quite soggy. But otherwise, this is a fine, 2 km walk in an area",
          "We've been walking the Fenland trail for years. It is an easy 2km loop that you can extend by walking to and from town. As the kids get older, the faster it is to complete. There's a picnic area there too.",
          "I was admittedly disappointed by the trail. We saw some interesting mushrooms, mosses and flowers which we do not have in our neck of the woods and could observe two woodpeckers on the way, but the short trail could not bring about this WOW effect which can already be",
          "The Fenland Loop, as the locals call it, is a very pleasant walk in the woods for folks of all ages and is relatively flat in comparison to most other walks in the area. There are park benches all along the way to rest and relax by either the Bow River, or, one of the several",
          "Great walk, lots to see, we saw a woodpecker really close up as well as squirrels and elk. We somehow missed the sign back to the car park though so could have ended up doing the trail twice so just beware!",
          "We took a short walk on the Fenland Trail to gain some fresh air and commune with nature. It was about 2-3 kms. and it took us a little over 20 minutes to complete on a sunny afternoon. The shady woodland was well marked and easy to walk.",
          "Earlier reviews had said that bears can be spotted here but we didn't see any - more our fault than theirs I would say! Lovely gentle trail through the woods and who knows, you might be lucky!",
          "this is an easy walk from Banff centre. It is mainly through woodland and follows the river. Lots of wildlife to see if you stop and take time.",
          "This was an add-on walk that turned out to be excellent. Well worth an hour or so. Pick up one of the self directing brochures and follow the trail. Neat information - and check out the bear claw marks on the trees. We saw a group of deer shortly into the walk. Covers areas of",
          "Right next to Vermillian lakes, very woodsy, along the river. Flat. Occasionally see elk. Many locals walk their dogs along here.",
          "Well worth doing if you are into scenery and animals and an interesting contrast to the peaks and glacier scenery that surrounds Banff. On this trail we saw a musk rat up close and watched it for about 10 minutes, and an elk within 5 metres. Also squirrels, chipmunks and birds.",
          "love this place, 2 minutes from town, Beevers all along the river. best seen at dusk. great for us Brits who don't see this everyday. loved it. last year in same place we even saw a grizzly on the road down to vermillion lakes.",
          "Walked the Fenland Loop and even saw wild life- several squirrels, a shrew, an amazing male Elk and a couple of mule deer. Very Picturesque walking alongside a small creek Graeme & Mary Adelaide South Australia",
          "This is a refreshing and easy walk for anyone. Young children and the sure-footed elderly can handle this walk. Fragrant pine, mountains, various vegetation, massive pines and a small river/creek are some of the delights of the walk.",
          "This is an easy walk with some paved and some well kept dirt trail. It winds next to the Bow river and a smaller stream. There are birds, muskrats and beavers. Very quiet and beautiful.",
          "We chose to extend the walk into Vermillion Lakes and returned but didn't complete the loop as we came out somewhere else further up. It was a pleasant, flat walk with a trail map and points of interest along the way. The traffic noise lessened the further we got along the",
          "The Fenland Trail is a nice evening walk where you will most likely see beavers in the river. I saw beavers two evenings in a row. A female beaver with its young playing in the river. The beaver came up on the river bank and I got very close to it. They have poor eye sight, so",
          "A small circular trail very close to the centre of Banff that only takes about 45 minutes. It was good for an evening wander, had some very interesting vegetation and we spotted a beaver in the stream. Worth picking up a leaflet from the entrance before setting off.",
          "A lovely walk through the woods taking in Bow Valley River tributaries. Expect to see Elk and take your bear spray with you just in case.",
          "We were desperate to see some live animals and this trail fit the bill. Just around dusk, two elk came out along the railroad tracks adjacent to the trail. The trail is close to the Banff railroad station and easy to walk.",
          "One of the few flat hiking trails in the Banff area. Our family enjoyed this leisurely trail that is through a forest, along a beautiful river. We dipped our feet in the ice cold water. It was a pleasant 1 hour of the afternoon.",
          "We did this trail in the late afternoon / early evening. There were no more English brochures available but plenty of French ones. Saw very few people on the trail. Was prepared to take pics of animals and was blessed by spotting beavers. The interpretive / informative",
          "Nice walk through trees and by creek. No elevation. No waterfalls. Points of interest on a self guided tour with brochures at the beginning of trail head, English and French. No English left so we took a French and used Google Translator. Bring bug spray!.",
          "The fenland trail is easy to find and follow. It is located withing Banff's townsite. We followed the Bow River Trail to the Fenland Trail. Nice short hike, about 1 hour tops.",
          "The Fenland trail is nice for a quiet walk. Lots of bird species. But it is NOT on Norquay road. It is near the west entrance to Banff.",
          "Visited on a couple of occasions during our stay. Easy trail to follow, we spotted a few birds and enjoyed the views of the rivers. Can also walk through to vermillion lakes from here.",
          "We were enjoying a walk along the Bow River and came upon signs for the Fenland Trail, a very gentle walk that encompasses a fenland and at times is in sight of the Bow River, we encountered very few people but did come across a mule deer who was very happy to be photographed by",
          "This was my first walk in Banf - simply followed the walking trail along the Bow River from town to its start point early in the morning. Was flat, muddy in parts, mostly shaded by tall trees, with no particularly good views. I was hoping it would be a good place to see some",
          "We walked the Fenland trail to reach the Vermillion Lakes and found it to be very pretty. We even swam in the river along the trail because it was so inviting but cold!!! Recommend trying this trail if you like to be secluded because it isn't very known so you get a little bit",
          "Easily travelled woodland trail. Great spot for bird watching. Plenty of chipmunks. Chatted with a squirrel for a bit. Saw evidence of beaver activity. Watched a kayaker on Vermillion lakes.",
          "Through woodland and along a picturesque river. When we were there the river was partially iced over which gave it a particular charm. Not a long trail, but worth doing",
          "Wanted to enjoy the outdoor space at Banff one more time before the shuttle to Calgary. No one else enjoying this lovely trail through the woods and along the creek. Can you hear highway noise at times - yes. It was still a nice place to get away .",
          "This 2.1k loop is a relaxing stroll just outside of the town. On February family day weekend the trail was lightly snow covered but icy underneath. Ice cleats would be helpful.",
          "We had a spare half hour so, as we were parked by the railway station, we strolled round the Fenland Trail. It's a flat and fairly uninspiring trail through trees. Would be okay for families with young children but not really for the more adventurous or anyone wanting a",
          "This is a good shaded stroll for a hot day. It's also popular with the locals in winter and you won't usually need snowshoes to manage the trail since it is packed down shortly after each snowfall. The terrain is mostly flat and meanders through some old spruce and pine forest.",
          "Walked this trail with our 6 month old in a stroller. The path was a nice and easy to get around with the stroller. There were great interpretive signs along the path. The only bad thing (and it's extremely minor) was that the brochures and maps provided by the National Park",

          "Fenland trail is a short (2.4 km) loop trail in the town of Banff. It's just on the outskirts of the town, so easy to get to (there are two parking lots conveniently located close by as well), but nice and quiet, away from the town noise. The trail follows 40 Mile Creek (just",
          "This is a very pretty, no elevation stroll through a wet area with abundant greenery and wildflowers. It was our last hike after some more strenuous hiking and was a very pleasant and pretty walk to end our hiking vacation. Take your time and stroll. It is great for little",
          "This is a lovely trail, close to the Banff townsite but far enough to get away from the crowds. We did not see any wildlife but the trail does go over or along a quiet creek and we like to watch water. The trail is supposed to be 2 km long but it did not seem that long to us.",
          "Took a wander along this trail which was very quiet. Unfortunately no wildlife was seen. We detoured off the route to go to vermiliion lakes - worth the detour.",
          "Well duh, I'm not going to tell you to go to one of the best damm little hiking loops in Banff ..... its a great little trail that we don't want the tourists to find out about!! (grin) Great for photos and usually very quiet .... there are bears there sometimes but the wardens",
          "Short, flat, nice pre breakfast walk. Not an exciting hike, but beat the crowd and wildlife may be spotted. Bikers and walkers with dogs seem to like it. If you have limited time it may be something to pass up, but if you have an hour to kill, it beats walking downtown in",
          "We went on this trail around 8:30 in the morning (season: autumn). It was crisp and quiet - we only encountered one other hiker. The trail had a really amazing vibe - it's almost entirely covered by forest. The shrub is very dense and full of what looked like burrows, fox",
          "Well laid out self interpretive trail very near town. It also intersects with Vermillion Lakes. Keep an eye out for wildlife.",
          "The path Fenland is pleasant to travel(browse), without too many difficulties. The only fauna(crowd) that we were born by our passage limits itself to squirrels and water rat. In addition, of numerous mosquitoes",
          "We were quiet disappointed from the Fenland Trail, Yes it's a nice walk but just like any other forest walk, however, don't forget to cover yourself in mosquitoes repellent, there are so many of them - you can actually see them and hear them, we walked into a cloud of them and",
          "Nice short walk in the trees. Although this is fenland there are plenty of board walks so no need for wellies. If walking here I would strongly recommend going another 100yards out of town and before highway 1 on the left is Vermilion lakes.",
          "Of nine hikes we did in the Banff/Jasper area this week, easily the most disappointing. No wildlife, no real changes in scenery. I'm afraid we were spoiled by Parker Ridge, the Ink Pots and Johnson Canyon, Grassi Lakes, Morraine Lake and consolation Lakes, Tunnel Mountain and",
          "Before setting out on the trail, I recommend picking up a trail leaflet. There were none at the trailhead so I was thankful I'd picked one up from the ranger kiosk at the train station the day before. The artworks are lovely on the posts on the trail and the corresponding",
          "Posting this just as a warning to be careful really. Started out on the trail, which is a very short walk out of Banff town. After a few minutes were confronted by other walkers coming from the opposite direction at great pace warning us of a Grizzly just round the corner coming",
          "First off this trail has been under construction for at least two years. while you can visit this small park like trail system at the edge of Banff. It's better to simple skip this trail system and walk out to Vermillion Lakes or Sundance Canyon as they are far more rewarding.",
          "Bow river is still frozen, and lots of snow on the ground but the trail was very walkable. Close to town, but true wilderness experience",
          "The Fenland trail provides you with a lovely walk through the trees next to the Bow river especially on a sunny winter's day. It's very near to Banff, and is a great way to spend a lazy morning or afternoon wandering on well marked out trails in the trees away from traffic and",
          "This is a terrific hike to take the kids on. It's short, but it follows the river and some marshlands and is a very interesting, easy trail. The kids may see some trout in the river, and perhaps even a beaver or two.",
          "You may find many things you didn't expect on this beautiful, quiet trail. A very beautiful walk in the woods.",
          "If you just want to stroll on an easy path, then fenland trail is yours to enjoy. Bring your camera, maybe binoculars, and enjoy this very easy trail where you may see all sorts of wildlife. 4 legged, and feathered. There plenty of benches around for you to stop and soak in the",
          "It is a nice walk on a cooler day. The trip only takes a while and is very pleasant and quiet. We did not see much wildlife but the trail was well kept.",
          "Nice trail close to Banff, pretty but busy in July and nothing much to see in the way of birds and animals. Disappointed",
          "We \"hiked\" (walked) this trail to find the geocache hidden there. It is extremely mundane compared to anything else we did in the area. And to echo some of the other reviews, the mosquitos were horrible...between the mosquitos and the flat terrain, we felt like we were back",
          "I know mosquito repellent is needed anywhere in Banff in the summer, but on this trail it's really needed. Not a beautiful trail, but easy and peaceful. But I'd prefer walking along the Bow River, and certainly up Tunnel Mountain. Was the least interesting trail we took in",

          "The June 2013 floods turned a pretty little creek into a raging torrent here and wiped out paths, boardwalks and picnic tables. Town of Banff/Parks Canada is doing a great job rebuilding but, like everything, it takes time. The picnic tables are back, the bridge is clear.",
          "It is a walk around a wooded area overlooking a tributary to the Bow River. Very convenient to get to, just a 2 min walk from Banff Centre and very flat if you do not want to exert yourself. NDoesn't take long (20 minutes), is free and is nice enough. So is \"Poor\" a bit harsh?",
          "Want to experience a beautiful woods and river hike on flat ground? It's short and easy. That's the great thing about the area - there is something for every age and skill level.",
          "On a hot day, this is perfect for a casual stroll under canopy of the trees alongside the streams with their green-blue colour. You can also deviate fro the 1.5km trail and walk back into town or further onto Vermillion Lakes and join the main trail by the Trans Canada Highway.",
          "This is a small spot and kind of hard to locate, but a nice hike, more of a woodland spot. I was there very early in the morning and the only other person there was a birder with his camera.",
          "Nice little trek in the woods with beautiful views of the wetlands and creek. Benches to rest and enjoy the stillness. Easy walk. Stop at Tim Hortons and take a coffee for the walk or warm up with afterwards if you go in winter as we did.",
          "I found Fenland Trail by accident and am glad I did. It is just over the train lines from the Bow trail and is an easy 2km walk. It is a beautiful quiet walk in winter and the people I met on my walks were really friendly. It is where I had my first wildlife experience outside",

          "We stayed in the Rocky Mountain Resort during our skiing trip. The resort offered a number of guided walks. The Fenland Trail was one of the walks offered. It is a nice little walk, it is surprising quite, considering that it is so close to Banff and the highway. All I could",

          "Nice and short and cool looking multiple water falls but wow the mosquitos were ravenous. Part of our group ran out of the forest and the bug repellent didn't seem to impress these bugs. Looked like a good scramble up the cliffs for much better views or take the left cut off"

      "name": "Banff National Park Of Canada",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Banff National Park (French: Parc national Banff) is Canada's oldest national park and was established in 1885. Located in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110\u2013180 kilometres (68\u2013112 mi) west of Calgary, Banff encompasses 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi) of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. The Icefields Parkway extends from Lake Louise, connecting to Jasper National Park in the north. Provincial forests and Yoho National Park are neighbours to the west, while Kootenay National Park is located to the south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway was instrumental in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5 million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through the park on the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.\nBanff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThroughout its history, Banff National Park has been shaped by tension between conservationist and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who had the right to develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.\n\n\n=== Indigenous peoples ===\nArchaeological evidence found at Vermilion Lakes indicates the first human activity in Banff to 10,300 B.P. Prior to European contact, the area that is now Banff National Park, was home to many Indigenous Peoples, including the Stoney Nakoda, Ktunaxa, Tsuut'ina, Kainaiwa, Piikani, Siksika, and Plains Cree . Indigenous Peoples utilized the area to hunt, fish, trade, travel, survey and, practice culture.  Many areas within Banff National Park are still known by their Stoney Nakoda names such as Lake Minnewanka and the Waputik Range. Cave and Basin served as an important cultural and spiritual site for the Stoney Nakoda.With the admission of British Columbia to Canada on 20 July 1871, Canada agreed to build a transcontinental railroad. Construction of the railroad began in 1875, with Kicking Horse Pass chosen, over the more northerly Yellowhead Pass, as the route through the Canadian Rockies. Ten years later, on 7 November 1885, the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, British Columbia.\n\n\n=== Rocky Mountains Park established ===\nWith conflicting claims over the discovery of hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided to set aside a small reserve of 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to 674 km2 (260 sq mi) and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after Yellowstone and Mackinac National Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and increase the number of rail passengers.\n\nThe Stoney Nakoda First Nation were removed from Banff National Park between the years 1890 and 1920. The park was designed to appeal to sportsmen, and tourists. The exclusionary policy met the goals of sports hunting, tourism, and game conservation, as well as of those attempting to \"civilize\" the First Nations of the area.Early on, Banff was popular with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and continued westward on the railroad. Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded one of the first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.By 1911, Banff was accessible by automobile from Calgary. Beginning in 1916, the Brewsters offered motorcoach tours of Banff. In 1920, access to Lake Louise by road was available, and the Banff-Windermere Road opened in 1923 to connect Banff with British Columbia.\n\nIn 1902, the park was expanded to cover 11,400 km2 (4,400 sq mi), encompassing areas around Lake Louise, and the Bow, Red Deer, Kananaskis, and Spray rivers. Bowing to pressure from grazing and logging interests, the size of the park was reduced in 1911 to 4,663 km2 (1,800 sq mi), eliminating many eastern foothills areas from the park. Park boundaries changed several more times up until 1930, when the area of Banff was fixed at 6,697 km2 (2,586 sq mi), with the passage of the National Parks Act. The Act, which took effect May 30, 1930, also renamed the park Banff National Park, named for the Canadian Pacific Railway station, which in turn was named after the Banffshire region in Scotland. With the construction of a new east gate in 1933, Alberta transferred 0.84 km2 (0.32 sq mi) to the park. This, along with other minor changes in the park boundaries in 1949, set the area of the park at 6,641 km2 (2,564 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Coal mining ===\nIn 1887, the First Nations of the area signed Treaty 7, which gave Canada rights to explore the land for resources. At the beginning of the 20th century, coal was mined near Lake Minnewanka in Banff. For a brief period, a mine operated at Anthracite but was shut down in 1904. The Bankhead mine, at Cascade Mountain, was operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1903 to 1922. In 1926, the town was dismantled, with many buildings moved to the town of Banff and elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Internment camps ===\nDuring World War I, immigrants from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine were sent to Banff to work in internment camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter. Much early infrastructure and road construction was done by men of various Slavic origins although Ukrainians constituted a majority of those held in Banff. Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.\n\nIn 1931, the Government of Canada enacted the Unemployment and Farm Relief Act which provided public works projects in the national parks during the Great Depression. In Banff, workers constructed a new bathhouse and pool at Upper Hot Springs, to supplement Cave and Basin. Other projects involved road building in the park, tasks around the Banff townsite and construction of a highway connecting Banff and Jasper. In 1934, the Public Works Construction Act was passed, providing continued funding for the public works projects. New projects included construction of a new registration facility at Banff's east gate and construction of an administrative building in Banff. By 1940, the Icefields Parkway reached the Columbia Icefield area of Banff and connected Banff and Jasper. Most of the infrastructure present in the national park dates from public work projects enacted during the Great Depression.Internment camps were once again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps were largely composed of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Winter tourism ===\nWinter tourism in Banff began in February 1917, with the first Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a regional middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and skijoring. In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, was developed by the Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.\n\nSince 1968, when the Banff Springs Hotel was winterized, Banff has been a year-round destination. In the 1950s, the Trans-Canada Highway was constructed, providing another transportation corridor through the Bow Valley, making the park more accessible.Canada launched several bids to host the Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid to host the 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, as environmental lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\n=== Conservation ===\nSince the original Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent acts and policies placed greater emphasis on conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The Act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation came added obligations for conservation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving local residents more say regarding any proposed developments.In the 1990s, development plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues relating to development in the park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBanff National Park is located in the Rocky Mountains on Alberta's western border with British Columbia in the Alberta Mountain forests ecoregion. By road, the town of Banff is 128 kilometres (80 mi) west of Calgary and 401 km (249 mi) southwest of Edmonton. Jasper National Park borders Banff National Park to the north, while Yoho National Park is to the west and Kootenay National Park is to the south. Kananaskis Country, which includes Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park, Spray Valley Provincial Park, and Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, is located to the south and east of Banff.\nThe Trans-Canada Highway passes through Banff National Park, from the eastern boundary near Canmore, through the towns of Banff and Lake Louise, and into Yoho National Park in British Columbia. The Banff townsite is the main commercial centre in the national park. The village of Lake Louise is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway and the Icefields Parkway, which extends north to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n=== Banff ===\n\nBanff, established in 1885, is the main commercial centre in Banff National Park, as well as a centre for cultural activities. Banff is home to several cultural institutions, including the Banff Centre, the Whyte Museum, the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum, Cave and Basin National Historic Site, and several art galleries. Throughout its history, Banff has hosted many annual events, including Banff Indian Days which began in 1889, and the Banff Winter Carnival. Since 1976, The Banff Centre has organized the Banff Mountain Film Festival. In 1990, Banff incorporated as a town of Alberta, though still subject to the National Parks Act and federal authority in regards to planning and development. In its 2014 census, the town of Banff had a permanent population of 8,421 as well as 965 non-permanent residents for a total population of 9,386. The Bow River flows through the town of Banff, with the Bow Falls located on the outskirts of town.\n\n\n=== Lake Louise ===\n\nLake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km (34 mi) northwest of the town of Banff, is home to the landmark Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km (9.3 mi) from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969\u20131979 (\"Scenes of Canada\") series. The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.\n\n\n=== Icefields Parkway ===\n\nThe Icefields Parkway is a 230-kilometre-long (140 mi) road connecting Lake Louise to Jasper, Alberta. The Parkway originates at Lake Louise, and extends north up the Bow Valley, past Hector Lake, which is the largest natural lake in the park. Other scenic lakes near the parkway include Bow Lake, and Peyto Lakes, both north of Hector Lake. The Parkway then crosses Bow Summit (2,088 m (6,850 ft)), and follows the Mistaya River to Saskatchewan Crossing, where it converges with the Howse and North Saskatchewan River. Bow Summit is the highest elevation crossed by a public road in Canada.The North Saskatchewan River flows east from Saskatchewan Crossing, out of Banff, into what is known as David Thompson Country, and onto Edmonton. The David Thompson Highway follows the North Saskatchewan River, past the man-made Abraham Lake, and through David Thompson Country.\nNorth of Saskatchewan Crossing, the Icefields Parkway follows the North Saskatchewan River up to the Columbia Icefield. The Parkway crosses into Jasper National Park at Sunwapta Pass at 2,035 metres (6,677 ft) in elevation, and continues on from there to the Jasper townsite.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Canadian Rockies consist of several northwest-southeast trending ranges. Two main mountain ranges are within the park, each consisting of numerous subranges. The western border of the park follows the crest of the Main Ranges (also known as the Park Ranges), which is also the continental divide. The Main Ranges in Banff National Park include from north to south, the Waputik, Bow and Blue Ranges. The high peaks west of Lake Louise are part of the Bow Range. The eastern border of the park includes all of the Front Ranges consisting of from north to south, the Palliser, Sawback and Sundance Ranges. The Banff townsite is located in the Front Ranges. Just outside of the park to the east lie the foothills that extend from Canmore at the eastern entrance of the park eastward into the Great Plains. Well west of the park, the Western Ranges of the Rockies pass through Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. Though the tallest peak entirely within the park is Mount Forbes at 3,612 metres (11,850 ft), Mount Assiniboine on the Banff-Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park border is slightly higher at 3,618 m (11,870 ft).The Canadian Rockies are composed of sedimentary rock, including shale, sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The vast majority of geologic formations in Banff range in age from Precambrian to the Jurassic periods (600\u2013145 m.y.a.). However, rocks as young as the lower Cretaceous (145\u201366 m.y.a.) can be found near the east entrance and on Cascade Mountain above the Banff townsite. These sedimentary rocks were laid down in shallow seas between 600 and 175 m.y.a. and were pushed east during the Laramide orogeny. Mountain building in Banff National Park ended approximately 55 m.y.a.The Canadian Rockies may have rose up to 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) approximately 70 m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion carved the mountains into their present rugged shape. The erosion was first due to water, then was greatly accelerated by the Quaternary glaciation 2.5 million years ago. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, ar\u00eates, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains.Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40\u201360 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.\nClassic examples are found at the Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just to the north of the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.\n\n\n=== Glaciers and icefields ===\n\nBanff National Park has numerous large glaciers and icefields, 100 of which can be observed from the Icefields Parkway. Small cirque glaciers are fairly common in the Main Ranges, situated in depressions on the side of many mountains. As with the majority of mountain glaciers around the world, the glaciers in Banff are retreating. While Peyto Glacier is one of the longest continuously studied glaciers in the world, with research extending back to the 1970s, most of the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies have only been scientifically evaluated since the late 1990s. Glaciologists are now researching the glaciers in the park more thoroughly, and have been analyzing the impact that reduced glacier ice may have on water supplies to streams and rivers. Estimates are that 150 glaciers disappeared in the Canadian Rockies (areas both inside and outside Banff National Park) between the years 1920 and 1985. Another 150 glaciers disappeared between 1985 and 2005, indicating that the retreat and disappearance of glaciers is accelerating. In Banff National Park alone, in 1985 there were 365 glaciers but by 2005, 29 glaciers had disappeared. The total glaciated area dropped from 625 to 500 square kilometres (241 to 193 sq mi) in that time period.The largest glaciated areas include the Waputik and Wapta Icefields, which both lie on the Banff-Yoho National Park border. Wapta Icefield covers approximately 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in area. Outlets of Wapta Icefield on the Banff side of the continental divide include Peyto, Bow, and Vulture Glaciers. Bow Glacier retreated an estimated 1,100 m (3,600 ft) between the years 1850 and 1953, and since that period, there has been further retreat which has left a newly formed lake at the terminal moraine. Peyto Glacier has lost 70 percent of its volume since record keeping began and has retreated approximately 2,000 m (6,600 ft) since 1880; the glacier is at risk of disappearing entirely within the next 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe Columbia Icefield, at the northern end of Banff, straddles the Banff and Jasper National Park border and extends into British Columbia. Snow Dome, in the Columbia Icefield is a hydrological apex of North America, with water flowing via outlet glaciers to the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Saskatchewan Glacier, which is approximately 13 km (8 mi) in length and 30 km2 (12 sq mi) in area, is the major outlet of the Columbia Icefield that flows into Banff National Park. Between the years 1893 and 1953, Saskatchewan Glacier had retreated a distance of 1,364 m (4,475 ft), with the rate of retreat between the years 1948 and 1953 averaging 55 m (180 ft) per year. Overall, the glaciers of the Canadian Rockies lost 25 percent of their mass during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the park has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. The climate is influenced by altitude with lower temperatures generally found at higher elevations. Located on the eastern side of the Continental Divide, Banff National Park receives 472 millimetres (18.6 in) of precipitation annually. This is considerably less than in Yoho National Park on the western side of the divide in British Columbia, where 884 mm (34.8 in) is received at Wapta Lake and 616 mm (24.3 in) at Boulder Creek annually. Being influenced by altitude, snowfall is also greater at higher elevations. As such, 234 cm (92 in) of snow falls on average each year in the Banff townsite, while 304 cm (120 in) falls in Lake Louise, which is located at a higher altitude.During winter months, temperatures in Banff are moderated, compared to other areas of central and northern Alberta, due to Chinook winds and other influences from British Columbia. The mean low temperature during January is \u221215 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F), and the mean high temperature is \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) for the town of Banff. However, temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124.0 \u00b0F) with wind chill values dropping below \u221230 \u00b0C (\u221222.0 \u00b0F).  Weather conditions during summer months are warm, with high temperatures during July averaging 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F), and daily low temperatures averaging 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F), leading to a large diurnal range owing to the relative dryness of the air.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Ecoregions ===\n\nBanff National Park spans three ecoregions, including montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, which consists mainly of dense forest, comprises 53 percent of Banff's area. 27 percent of the park is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at 2,300 m (7,500 ft), with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3 percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are more common in the subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nThe park has 56 recorded mammal species. Grizzly bears and black bears inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and wolf are the primary predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose tend to be more elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds can be found in Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the Canada jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.Endangered species in Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that is found in the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland caribou.\n\n\n=== Mountain pine beetles ===\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused a number of large-scale infestations in Banff National Park, feeding on the phloem of mature lodgepole pines. Alberta's first known outbreak occurred in 1940, infecting 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of forest in Banff. A second major outbreak occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Banff and the surrounding Rocky Mountains region.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nBanff National Park is the most visited Alberta tourist destination and one of the most visited national parks in North America, with more than three million tourists annually. Tourism in Banff contributes an estimated C$6 billion annually to the economy.A park pass is required for stopping in the park, and permit checks are common during the summer months, especially at Lake Louise and the start of the Icefields Parkway. A permit is not required if travelling straight through the park without stopping. Approximately 5 million people pass through Banff annually on the Trans-Canada Highway without stopping.In 2009, Banff Lake Louise Tourism hoped the appearance of the \"Crasher Squirrel\" internet meme would stimulate interest in the park. The meme is based on a photograph of a Minnesotan couple visiting the park on the shore of Lake Minnewanka that was \"crashed\" by a Columbian ground squirrel; the photograph was published in major news sources around the world and the image of the squirrel was digitally manipulated into humorous photos.\n\n\n== General management ==\n\nBanff National Park is managed by Parks Canada, under the National Parks Act which was passed in 1930. Over time, park management policies have increasingly emphasized environmental protection over development. In 1964, a policy statement was issued that reiterated ideals of conservation laid out in the 1930 act. With the controversial bid for the 1972 Winter Olympics, environmental groups became more influential, leading Parks Canada to withdraw its support for the bid. The 1979 Beaver Book was a major new policy, which emphasized conservation. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended, making the maintenance of ecological integrity the top priority. The amendment also paved the way for non-governmental organizations to challenge Parks Canada in court, for breaches in adhering to the Act. In 1994, Parks Canada established revised \"Guiding Principles and Operating Policies\", which included a mandate for the Banff-Bow Valley Study to draft management recommendations. As with other national parks, Banff is required to have a Park Management Plan. On a provincial level, the park area and the included communities (other than the town of Banff which is an incorporated municipality) are administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs as Improvement District No. 9 (Banff).\n\n\n== Wildlife management ==\n\n\n=== Previous management ===\nThe park was originally considered as a recreational area for visitors offering multiple leisure activities \u2013 the original wildlife policy viewed wildlife in Banff only as game or pests up until the 1960s and 1970s. As ecological awareness increased, management procedures expanded with the inclusion of public participation in many management decisions. Simultaneously, the increase in human construction (such as new highways) on the natural landscape increased the frequency of human\u2013animal conflicts. In 1988 wildlife began to be considered an integral part of the ecosystem.The park now has a number of wildlife management strategies that aim to conserve certain species. Parks Canada uses an ecosystem based management approach that aims to preserve the ecology of the park while still providing for visitors. Management decisions are based on modern scientific ecological information as well as traditional knowledge.\n\n\n=== Large species management ===\nElk are a very important species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human\u2013animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, the implementation of the Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and the Elk Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.\nElk handling facilities are areas of pens with loading and unloading ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk from the town of Banff. These measures allowed more predator\u2013prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.\n\nThe state of grizzly bear populations in Banff is seen as a proxy for ecological integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear\u2013human encounter is high.\nAversive conditioning deters bears by modifying their behaviour. Deterrents such as noise makers and rubber bullets are used each time the bear performs an undesirable action. Advice is also given to people to avoid an eventual habituation of bears to human presence. If this conditioning is continual the bear will be less likely to continue the undesirable behaviour (crossing into campsites and roads etc.).Southern mountain caribou management previously aimed to identify what was threatening caribou populations and find solutions to mitigate the threats, but the last caribou in the park was found dead in an avalanche in 2009. There was concern over why more had not been done to save the caribou population. The primary reason for their decline is thought to have been habitat loss and altered predator\u2013prey dynamics. Park management began monitoring the last five caribou in the park in 2002 and taking actions such as reducing impacts of humans, conducting studies of the population, and investigating the possibility of translocating caribou to increase the Banff population.\n\nIn the mid-1980s gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to systematic predator control hunting which began in 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve the balance of the ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project \u2013 the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60\u201370 animals.Plains bisons were successfully reintroduced to Banff in 2017. These bison are to be kept under observation in an enclosed pasture of this park until the summer of 2018, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nWildlife crossings have been successful in Banff National Park at reducing the number of animals killed on the roads. There is also 82 km of fencing at the edge of the highway in the park to prevent animals from getting onto the roads. Since it was put up, this has reduced collisions between wildlife and vehicles by over 80 per cent.Train tracks still pose challenges to conservationists. Many bears have been killed by trains, often because they are attracted to grain spills along the tracks. Transportation corridors provide openings for plants which are also utilised by bears.  A partnership between Parks Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway allowed the creation of the first Railway-Bear Conflict Mitigation Symposium in 2010. Initiatives included building wooden pegboards to fence off the sides of tracks and chemically treating grains to deter the bears. After a complete review of the research projects, the development of some of them has been authorized, including grain alteration and the use of cameras to study the behavioural response of bears to trains.In 2011, Parks Canada began to study the effectiveness of electro-mats, large mats that give a small electric shock to animals that step on them, as a potential deterrent around train tracks. A trial installment of the mats was placed in Banff to test their effectiveness in deterring animals like bears from gaining access to the fenced train tracks inside the park.General prohibitions implemented to ensure wildlife respect include the prohibition of feeding, touching, or holding animals in captivity, and the disturbance or destruction of bird nests.\n\n\n== Human impact ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nSince the 19th century, humans have impacted Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, and development in the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.The population of bull trout and other native species of fish in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, with the introduction of non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.\n\nThe Trans-Canada Highway, passing through Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for wildlife due to vehicle traffic and as an impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a number of points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.\n\n\n=== Fire management ===\nParks Canada management practices, notably fire suppression, since Banff National Park was established have impacted the park's ecosystem. Since 1983, Parks Canada has adopted a strategy that employed prescribed burns, which helps to mimic effects of natural fires.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nBanff National Park is bisected by two highways that cross the Alberta/British Columbia border while another provides a third access within Alberta.  The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) bisects the park in an east-west direction, connecting it to Vancouver to the west and Calgary to the east. Highway 93 bisects the park in a north-south direction, connecting it to Cranbrook to the south and Jasper to the north. The portion of Highway 93 north of Lake Louise is known as the Icefields Parkway whereas the portion southwest of Castle Junction is known as the Banff-Windermere Parkway. Highway 11 (the David Thompson Highway) connects the Icefields Parkway at Saskatchewan River Crossing to Rocky Mountain House to the northeast. Within the park, Highway 1A, also known as the Bow Valley Parkway, loosely parallels Highway 1 between Banff and Lake Louise.Other transportation facilities within Banff National Park include a Canadian Pacific rail line that generally parallels Highway 1 and an airport known as the Banff Park Compound Heliport.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1978, expansion of Sunshine Village ski resort was approved, with added parking, hotel expansion, and development of Goat's Eye Mountain. Implementation of this development proposal was delayed through the 1980s, while environmental assessments were conducted. In 1989, Sunshine Village withdrew its development proposal, in light of government reservations, and submitted a revised proposal in 1992. This plan was approved by the government, pending environmental review. Subsequently, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) filed a court injunction, which halted the development. CPAWS also put pressure on UNESCO to revoke Banff's World Heritage Site status, over concerns that developments were harming the park's ecological health.\n\n\n=== Banff-Bow Valley Study ===\n\nWhile the National Parks Act and the 1988 amendment emphasize ecological integrity, in practice Banff has suffered from inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain ecological integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.\nThe panel issued over 500 recommendations, including limiting the growth of the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with a buffalo paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.In response to concerns and recommendations raised by the Banff-Bow Valley Study, a number of development plans were curtailed in the 1990s. Plans to add nine holes at the Banff Springs Golf Resort were withdrawn in 1996.\n\n\n=== Canmore ===\nWith the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of historic places in Alberta's Rockies\nList of trails in Alberta\nList of mountains in Alberta\nList of waterfalls of Alberta\nBears and Man, a documentary on bear problems in the park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParks Canada Banff National Park page\nTown of Banff website",

          "Visiting Banff is expensive! And there is no off-season to look for travel deals. You have the beautiful spring, gorgeous summer, spectacular fall and precious winter skiing. If you are able, consider renting a caravan or mobile home to drive around - it gives you a lot more",
          "This was by far our favorite National Park we have ever been to and we definitely recommend it. There is so much to do, Gondola, hot springs, restaurants, shopping, etc.",
          "Banff National Park is beyond gorgeous! This is where you go if you really want to see how beautiful North America can be. There is the Park, the town of Banff, the town (or village?) of Lake Louise, Lake Louise itself, and 3 spectacular ski resorts. Both I and my husband",
          "Traveled to Banff in mid September expecting to see the last of the green mountain sides. Instead we ended up with snow & it made the trip so much more breathtaking! There are so many different places to go, hike, sight see. Moraine Lake was amazing. Peyto Lake stole our breath",
          "Banff is great in all seasons, but a wonderland in the winter. So much to do and take in, wish I could stay longer, but I will be back soon! Cross country skiing was great this trip. So was the downhill. Parks takes care of the trails very nicely. Walking around town is less",

          "Best NP ever been. I been many, but this one is one of the best. Don\u2019t miss Lake Moraine at Golden hour. It\u2019s amazing. Also if you have time, do Yoho NP and Jasper. They all are worth your trip. Enjoy traveling",
          "My wife and I spent 10 days exploring Banff National Park from one side to the other. It is notably different from U.S. National Parks that we have visited. It felt a little more crowded than many U.S. parks, but I suspect this is because so many of the attractions are",
          "There are no words that can describe the beauty of the entire Canadian Rockies. You need to take the Icefields Parkway between Banff and Jasper going through Lake Louise to be able to admire the beauty of this place. Don't take the highway, go on the side roads and you will not",

          "Banff is absolutely lovely, it\u2019s meant to be the oldest national park in Canada and it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous. Make sure you buy a pass in advance (if you are in the national parks for more than a week it\u2019s cheaper to get an annual pass). And put your pass on your windscreen so",
          "One of the great National Parks. Worth checking out the government backed website to get the best prices for admission tickets. Tickets need to purchased and displayed on the windscreen of the car. We purchased an annual pass which covered us for all parks. The Banff park is",
          "Loved our visit to Banff National Park. Beautiful lakes and hikes. Love the fenced highway with overpasses and underpasses to allow wildlife movement and migration. I'm finally visiting more of my own backyard. Banff is a must-see for anyone visiting Canada including people",

          "It is impossible to review this National Park in one entry as it is vast and there is so much to do. Suffice to say it is one of the most impressionable places I have visited. The sheer beauty and ruggedness takes your breath away. Sure there are maybe more attractive areas,",

          "I've been to the Rockies in the US, the Grand Tetons, and the Alps before this... nothing prepared me for the overwhelming beauty of the Canadian Rockies. The touristy things are crowded (the buses are kind of annoying) but there is a reason that they are touristy in the first",
          "We love visiting Banff in each season of the year, but especially in the Fall when, in some high alpine areas, the needles of the Alpine Larches turn yellow. The Valley of the Ten Peaks has become so famous for these, they've had to close Moraine Lake to cars, and set up a bus",
          "This large area offers many well-known lakes, but has numerous hiking trails (most require you to be in fairly good shape) as well. Or you can simply take several scenic drives to see the mountains, waterfalls, and wildlife. You do have to pay a hefty fee, but that also gives",
          "Our family spent five days and each day was packed with the glory of this National Park! It just does not get any better than this",
          "We had read from several sources to visit in September because the weather would be perfect & the crowds would have thinned out, so we booked our flights and came. As fate would have it though, Banff had an unusual cold front come in and it snowed right as we got there. We",

          "Banff is a beautiful park that is NOT overrated. Its special, its beautiful, it\u2019s the quintessential wilderness spot. However, it is commercialized and its popularity has made it extremely crowded. I would not stay in Banff town site. I would only stay near Lake Louise. The",
          "We traveled in the Banff, Jasper & Yoho parks. We were astonished to find out that maybe 90% of the area is not covered by cellular. I hope one doesnt need urgent aid or assistance. During the 8 days in the park, we did not see any park ranger - accept in the parking lots.",

          "It was one of the most beautiful place that I have ever visited in my life. To take pictures it\u2019s better to go in the morning, in a sunny day. The water is so blue that doesn\u2019t seem real. You don\u2019t need to walk to much to get there. Lakes are very close to the parking. The only",
          "We loved our time in the park hiking. Even on the days that didn\u2019t have perfectly clear skies, there was so much beauty to see. We hiked Lake Louise and the Plain of Six Glaciers teahouse. It is a big trek to the teahouse, but worth all the effort. We enjoyed our meal at the",
          "The park was beautiful but we found that the Parks Canada staff were very unfriendly, this is something we\u2019ve experienced from their staff across Canada before, which makes us not want to visit any Parks Canada location again.",
          "I have loved this park since my first visit for band camp in high school! Every visit brings a giant smile on my face, new learnings and amazing memories. I live for hiking, camping, skiing, rollerblading, biking, climbing, hot springs, and basically anything outdoors and",
          "We have wanted to see Banff for some time. We had been told that it was gorgeous. That is putting it mildly. The mountains are so majestic, and the way the light and the clouds play across them gives you something new to see everytime you look at them. The colors of the lakes",
          "Much more ragged mountains than the US Rockies driving up the Icefields pathway to Jasper from Lake Louise in Yoho, you will stop many times as we did and culminating in seeing the Columbia icefields, in essence glaciers a must do drive but do keep speed down for the wildlife we",

          "On my bucket list and unfortunately the views were disappointing due to the wildfires that had been ongoing for the previous 2 weeks. We arrived by 8AM and parking was still plentiful in the upper parking lot- it filled up very quickly within the following 20 minutes-get there",
          "They say that the Icefields Parkway has some of the best views in the world. Well, since it goes through Jasper Nat'l Park and Banff Nat'l Park, what does that say about them. Awesome!!!",
          "We stayed in Banff and visited many sections of Banff National Park. I cannot say how much we enjoyed this park. There is an opportunity for children to earn up to 5 different junior ranger badges. They have multiple visitor centers and museums within the park. There are",
          "The views are spectacular. We stopped in several places because there was so much to see. The mountain views are beautiful. We took so many pictures of wonderful spots. Nothing like it.",

          "Banff National Park is breathtakingly beautiful! Words cannot really describe it and photos just don't do it justice. I hope everyone gets the chance to visit this park at least once in their lifetime. The park charges $20 per day for a car and a receipt must be taped to your",
          "Summer is a great time to visit here as it is warm and you can hike the trails but it is high alpine so be prepared for rain anytime. The year round snow covered peaks loom in the background and can be seen for 50 miles off upon approach. All kinds of adventures can be had here",
          "A dream of a whole life came true! This National Park is a must for any nature lover who won't ever forget all these immersive impressions. Great scenery, great nature!",
          "There are many hikes that you can access just off the main shopping street of Banff. Go north of the shopping center towards the mountains and several trails begin. They are well marked. We had a great time just being in nature, away from everything. Although it was smokey",
          "It would be churlish to try and find fault with nature this majestic. We have just completed an 11 day tour of the Rockies in RVs and a good proportion was spent in Banff National Park. We are used to holidaying in the European Alps so contrasting them with the Rockies was",
          "What a great park. So many trails and sights to see. Unfortunately when we visited it was smokey from the BC wildfires but it was still an amazing place.",
          "I guess you dont know what to expect until you arrive in Banff....you can read reviews, look at books, browse pictures etc but until you get there and explore the park, it is hard to visualise the sheer beauty of all that surrounds you. Be it mountains, lakes, trails, canyons,",
          "This trip to Banff was a long time in the making and we were not disappointed. We expected to love it, but we had no idea how much there was to love. This park is a Must-See. Our American Rockies are stunning and this trait is continued and enlarged upon when one gets to",
          "Riding motorbikes all over the world but this is one of the MUST see places. Met Grizzly, black bear, deers, mountain cheeps and more. Stayed in tent in campgrounds and just loved the nature experience. Recommend this for everyone.",
          "Let's admit it: the park is beautiful and well maintained. Thoughts ...re-think the 90kph speed limit. Irritating. ...visitors might appreciate a sign identifying the wildlife overpasses as such.",
          "Absolutely stunning. I don't think there is anything else that can be said. We were very lucky to see a young bear, foraging at the side of the road. It was a truly amazing moment.",

          "Be ready for amazing views, lakes, rivers and wildlife encounters. Also be ready to hike if you really want to enjoy nature at its best. We stayed at Two Jacks (lake side spot) and Johnston Canyon (spot near river) and they were great campgrounds. Two Jacks lakeside was the best",
          "This place is amazing! Pictures don't do this place justice! The jagged peaks, the blue lakes. It's one amazing view after another. Animals all over the place. Plus, it's a HUGE park, so you can escape the crowds if you know where to go. I would recommend going to see all of the",
          "People seem to only think of the city of Banff, but there is a large national park associated with it. Be sure to take advantage of the different parts of the park and multitude of trails. Don't forget to pay you entry fee for the park and keep it displayed in your car",
          "Established in 1885, this is the oldest National Part in Canada. It's large - more than 2,500 sq. miles. If you stay on the Trans Canada highway you'll drive through it in about 3 hours, but you won't have really appreciated it. Stop at the roadside turnouts. Get out of your",
          "Lots of pretty sights to see. Be sure to stop and get a park pass--about $10 USD--if you plan to do any stopping. Without it, you could be fined. Worth it to have the pass, and the funds go to keeping up the parks. We had hoped to see wildlife, but never saw anything.",
          "I have visited Banff National Park 9 times since 1968. Like most national parks, it is getting more and more crowded and parking at major attractions such as Lake Louise, Moraine Lake & Johnston Canyon can make for a stressful experience. I do not like what I see happening here",
          "Yes, you must put this on the list - one of the most beautiful places I have seen! The views are all just breathtaking and the wildlife is amazing - we saw bears, big horn sheep, mountain goats, marmots, all kinds of squirrels, elk and even a mother and baby moose! I'm told",
          "I had only seen pictures of this amazing land and I had no idea what we were in for. The minute you enter the park, the Rockies emerge from the valley floor and it just keeps getting better the deeper you get into the park. Even if you have two hours, do not miss this one in a",

          "Banff National Park is one of the three national parks, which are close with others: Yoho, Banff and Jasper National Parks. Banff and Jasper are the National Park longest of three, and Banff is wonderful! Here you can see a lot of incredible views and natural places like lakes",

          "Wow! I live in the Colorado Rockies, but I must say that Banff, and the adjoining Yoho and Jasper National Parks offer the most beautiful combination of jagged mountain peaks, waterfalls and unbelievably-blue lakes I've ever seen. You really must see this park!",
          "The green turquoise hue of Lake Louise is like none other in the world. It is no wonder its on everyones bucket list. The hiking around the lake is very good as well. My only knock would be the tea house skip and pack a brown bag with your own sandwich and drink.",
          "This has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. The lakes are a pristine turquoise. The mountains are craggy and snow covered. There are waterfalls, glaciers, wildlife, towering evergreens. There was so much to see including the Ice Field parkway. Banff National",
          "The scenery is breathtaking, the icy clear blue waters, canyons, lakes and amazing hike trails and climbing. People here are friendly and the mood is upbeat. Only bummer is that you will be lucky to find any wildlife beyond Chipmunks here. After some research we found out most",

          "Banff is one of Canadas beautiful attractions, we visited with our young ones yesterday and were impressed with the beauty and many sites. Downtown is postcard perfect. Banff is most definitely a must see also one must be aware that it is pricey, a small pizza runs in the 20",
          "To see something of this NP you should have 2-3 days.So you can visit the towns Banff and Canmore, do some of the sightseeing around these towns and do Lake Louise.Better not go on a week-end as the streets will be crammed full then.This NP has got something for everybody and",

          "First off, you should know that we are from Colorado so we see the Rockies all day, every day. Upon first view, the Banff mountains reminded us of Maroon Bells here in Colorado. But then we started driving to the various glacial lakes and sulfurous springs and had an entirely",
          "Alberta's Banff National Park was amazing from beginning to end all the scenery along the Icefield Parkway form the many streams, rivers and waterfalls to the majestic ice capped mountains with clouds swirling around them. The first trip thru we were on the way to somewhere",
          "Banff is one of five connected federal parks. It offers a few resort towns, notably Banff and Lake Louise. Trails are abundant with raging rivers dense forest and majestic mountsins. We saw no large animals during our visit, but there have been sightings of bears, elk,",

          "We only had a day and a half to experience Banff, but boy was it amazing! I had, ahead of time, written a list of all the things I wanted to see while we were there and mapped them out. This trip was taken during high season the year that entrance to the parks was free, so it",

          "We stayed at Canmore just outside the park. Due to this being Canada\u2019s 150 birthday entry to the park was free. We spent some time in Banff, and did the gondola up Sulpher mountain which was sensational. The ice field parkway is worth the price of admission alone with the",

          "We are so impressed with this area and commend the Canadian government for all their efforts in keeping it clean, well-staffed and accessible to visitors from all over the world. It was easy to get around, and we added a lot to our visit by stopping at Banff's Visitor Center and",

          "We have been on a 3 week rail, coach, & ship trip with 2 days in Banff. This the most beautiful town with the mountains in view from the Main Street. It was summer holiday time & I have never seen so many motor homes. We went up the Glacier on a gondola, shame it was not long",
          "Best tip I can give you is to use trip advisor, books, and websites to prepare yourself for your time in Banff National Park. There is a lot to see and it takes time and it takes TIMING to know when to avoid crowds and to have the best lighting to see the full extent of the",

          "This park covers a massive area. Mostly mountains and forests where bear and elk roam. We were shocked when we passed a place where a car had hit a bear and I think we were all upset that it had happened. The park is trying so hard to keep the animals out of danger by fencing",
          "I might go back some time in the off season, but at a peak time, it was ridiculous. The town of Banff is overrun with pedestrians who seem like they've never seen a car before, so you are constantly stopped as they meander across the streets. Don't bother going to peak spots",

          "Well, what can I say. No single review can describe this incredible place. Best to spend at least 1 week investigated this place. Even then, you will bearly scratch the surface. My recommendation is to visit the various visitors centres to find out about the best attractions and latest information.",

          "So beautiful I don't even know where to begin.  Took at least a hundred amazing photos over the course of a few days.  My best advice is do plenty of research, and start early because there will be many other people who want to see it also, whatever you choose.",
          "My mother and I visited the Banff NP, Yoho NP, Lake Louise, and Jasper NP in May 2019.  Of all the scenic places I have visited around the world, the never-ending jagged canadian rockies is probably the most breathtaking.\n\nMay is a great \u2026",
          "This has got to be one of the must-see places and on the bucket list of everyone who has seen a movie or a photo of the majestic Canadian Rockies. If you've ever dreamt of gorgeous panoramas with high mountains, endless woods, lakes with \u2026",

          "Hit up Maraine Lake. Got there at about 5 am and waited for the sun to rise. This is definitely my favorite spot, as well as for others because it is PACKED by 5am. We arrived JUST in time as the parking lot was more or less full by that time. Well worth the extremely early drive!",
          "Hands down one of the most beautiful national parks We have ever been to so many waterfall gardens and hikes. The wild life is everywhere will definitely return",

          "Probably would have been really nice camping  if the rain had stopped. Very crowded camping area for such miserable September weather. Only place I've ever been to that had a high electric fence to keep the bears from eating the campers. Really would like to see it in July (August).",

          "An incredible experience. One of the most beautiful place I have ever seen yet. The weather, the place and the staff all were so supportive and a must visit the worthy place. Price of the can't car (the gondola) was reasonable but more than jasper Skytram.",
          "This is a must-see national park. It is extremely beautiful, the color of the glacial water is unbelievably blue. Photos do not do justice to the natural beauty. One can stare at the river, lakes and mountains all day. Lake Louise, Moraine \u2026",

          "Amazing beauty. Must visit this place. I need to visit once in the winters",

          "I love this place, grew up going here for vacation and still love it today (many years later). Even with the wildfires it is still beautiful. Highly recommend a kayak rental  from Blackiston & Company to take on the lake. The Townsite campground is also clean and quiet. Free showers!",
          "A fine place if you want to experience the rockies for the first time, but only for the first time. The place is getting too crowded with all of the attractions aimed towards a casual crowd. To any person who's extensively used the national \u2026",
          "It's like a diamond in the rough. A preserve of beauty and majesty surrounded by the workings of humankind. We need a places like this to rest our mind on what Eden once was.",

          "A true national beauty. If you have ever spent time or currently live in Canada, do yourself a favour and go check out nature at its finest. The cost to get into the park is well worth it. There are so many great restaurants to check out \u2026",

          "It's Banff, what can I say that hasn't already been said.  The day we were there we saw deer, bears, a wolf, and many different types of birds.  Some of the most beautiful scenery in Canada,  I love it.  Try some of the less touristy parts if you have the chance, well worth the time and money.",
          "Gorgeous... what can I say. I am an Albertan and I can get here in 4 hours from Edmonton. This is an incredible vacation close to home. You literally could come every weekend and do something new for years. Experience wildlife, nature, \u2026",

          "Absolutely stunning. The whole park is simply incredible. I would definitely recommend visiting lake Louise, although you need to get there early or late in the evening if you want to park there. If not, the walk from the town really isn't \u2026",

          "This place is beautiful. I hope they continue to protect it. Unfortunately when I was there, a lot of tourists leave their garbage behind and dont seem to care. 20 tour buses destroys the look and feel of the place. It used to be peaceful.",
          "This area is beautiful, we were there for 7 days and I'm sure we just saw the tip of the glacier. Sorry had to get that in....we were out every day on a new adventure, driving and hiking, every turn brought us another beautiful picture \u2026",

          "One of the natural wonders of Canada. It is crazy how beautiful the place is regardless of the weather.",
          "I can't believe how disappointed I was in Banff. They charge for day use of the park, and it's not cheap. Super disappointed that our government is even monetizing nature now. Canadian Citizenship have to pay just to experience the beautiful country we live in. Bucket list place is now in the bin.",
          "Such a beautiful place. I could certainly live here and be happy. The two weeks I spent there were not enough. The attractions and mountains are really interesting and beautiful. Just going for a walk through town is really nice.",
          "So beautiful place to visit but too much people",
          "Banff has a rich history and is built for tourists. Prices can be a bit high at times, but this has been my favourite National Park so far. A visit to Lake Louise and Morraine Lake is a must!",

          "Wonderful, but as with National Parks in the US, pick your spots; the ranger who sold us our passes suggested that if we wished to park and enjoy Lake Louise, that we arrive about 6:30 am.  Try as we might, we didn't manage to make it back \u2026",
          "Best time of my life, was very much therapeutic for me and soul searching. Going back in near future.",

          "If nature and scenic mountain beauty is what you are looking for in a mountain park, Banff National Park is a wonderful place to include on a tour.  However,  from May through September, call ahead of time to inquire about how much smoke is \u2026",

          "Lovely mountains and views, well worth a visit. Very touristy in popular areas to the point that it may hinder your experience. Sticking to more difficult trails, moderate or above, will greatly decrease the amount of people and are often \u2026",
          "I miss living in Banff, while it is a tourist town, having the mountains, trails and outdoor activities at your doorstep is a sure way to feel connected.

          "I recommend that you drive slowly through this National Park and stop frequently at the pull offs. The views are spectacular!

          "Amazing park. Can't imagine how this place was 100years ago. Fantastic town and friendly people everyone should try to visit here at least once in their life.",
          "One of the places in the entire world we keep coming back! Me and my wife is a nature's lover. This place is magnificent and still you can see lots of wildlife like dear, bear, goat mountain etc... lots of choices to go. Highly recommended to all who want to be amazed by nature!",
          "Breathtaking views that will leave you speechless",
          "Banff is super beautiful and I could imagine this place even more beautiful when there is snow on top of pine trees and mountains. Be warned though, it's crowded in summer months and trying to find parking takes forever.",
          "Absolutely beautiful on a scenic level, plenty to do all year round whether it be boarding, rafting hiking or climbing but very very busy in the summer months. Definitely worth a visit! Banff itself has an awesome party scene too!",
          "Worked there building  the Highway  and Animal  Overpasses. Enjoyed the scenery  was like a  Year round  Holiday.  Really  miss it.  But retired  now.",
          "Spectacular weather & scenery!  Many nice places to visit and stop for a picnic, take a hike, etc.",
          "What can I say that is not already been said. This place is beyond amazing. We only spent a couple of days here and I wish we had spent at least a week. We hiked from the hotel at Lake Louise to the Tea House (2100m) then on to 6 Glaciers \u2026",
          "It is a national treasure to be shared with anyone who wishes to use it properly.",
          "The beautiful park of Banff is one of the most scenic and amazing places I\u2019ve ever been! It\u2019s mountainous, clear, cool, and breathtaking. GO! GO NOW!",
          "Loved every minute of it, so much to see and do. Lake louise is beautiful on the eyes. Towns also good to walk through and plenty of food around there. Would recommend it to anyone who likes mountains and lakes to go there",
          "One of the greatest places I have ever traveled to. A must visit for people who love the outdoors",
          "Beautiful place to visit but now they have started to charge for shuttle buses if you don't get parking in lake Louise that is not good also you have to wait Atleast 1.5 to 2 hours to get on shuttle bus in peak hours. Visiting lake Louise isn't fun anymore I better visit other lakes.",
          "The most breathtaking scenery I've ever seen. Leaves you in awe of nature.  Just stunning! Can't wait to come back.",
          "One of the most beautiful place I've been in my life. Surrounded by mountains and trees. The little town of Banff was very cozy to be in too! Selection of food was also good! Many activities here but nothing overwhelming."

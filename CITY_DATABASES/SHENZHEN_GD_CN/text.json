        "wiki": "Shenzhen Bay Park (Chinese: \u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) is a seaside urban park in Shenzhen, China.The park occupies a 13-kilometre long stretch of reclaimed land along the southern coast of Shenzhen on the north shore of Shenzhen Bay (Deep Bay), starting west near Shenzhen Bay Bridge at Wanghai road and ending at the Hongshulin Nature Reserve. It spans much of the coastline of Nanshan and Futian districts. It runs along much of the length of Binhai and Binhe Boulevards and occupies an area of 108\uff0e07 hectares (267.0518 acres).\nThe park is divided into two sections, namely Shenzhen Bay Coastal Recreation Zone (\u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u6ee8\u6d77\u4f11\u95f2\u5e26) at its South West side and Hongshulin Coastal Ecological Park (\u7ea2\u6811\u6797\u6d77\u6ee8\u751f\u6001\u516c\u56ed) at its Eastern side. The latter is situated within the Hongshulin Nature Reserve, a habitat of numerous endangered bird species and is also known for its mangrove.\nThe entire area of the park opened on August 6, 2011, days before the 2011 Summer Universiade that took place in Shenzhen. The Hongshulin Coastal Ecological Park was opened earlier in December 2000. The entire length of the park is motor vehicle-free. Cycle paths and picnic spaces are featured along the park.\nThe park offers a panoramic view covering the Shenzhen skyline and New Territories, Hong Kong.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of parks in Shenzhen\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I live and work in Shenzhen and love the boardwalk along the bay. My family rides bikes on it, walks it, and plays at the sports park area. It is definitely a huge part of making Shekou feel like home.",
          "Many locals and sightseers come here to for long walks by the bay, jogging, exercising, and enjoying the water views and the garden areas,",
          "Remember! The best thig you can do before going somwhere in Shenzhen is to make sure you took enough water... i like long-distance walks but this one started before i get in the park exactly ;)",
          "This is a beautiful park along Shenzhen Bay stretching from Shekou Port to Futian ( 13 kilometres of well maintained green areas.) Some areas are not open for biking during the weekends. There are small beaches for kids to wade and go fishing. There is a fantastic view of Hong",

          "It is only a few subway stops away to get to so expect crowds on weekends. Still being able to watch tide rise and ebb, birds food scavenging or sometimes flying in flocks, and timed right, a sunset, make this a good place to recharge. Also the Happy Valley restaurant scene",
          "The park has 13 kilometers of green areas along the southern coast of Shenzhen Bay. We can see part of it from our balcony and it is beautiful at any time of the day. This is our favorite park for our evening walk, to run, or to bike. The view of the bridge connecting Shenzhen",
          "Shenzhen Bay park is beautiful! For a bike ride, a walk, a run, whatever. It's right on the water with beautiful scenery of both the water, docks, and flowers planted along the park.",

          "We walked throughout this park and enjoyed the views along the waterfront. Nice break from city life.",
          "No swimming possible as this is border territory but great view from Shenzhen Bay with the bridge in the background connecting Shenzhen with Hong Kong. Plan 1-2 hours and get there by taxi, makes for a nice afternoon by the sea.",

          "We drive by this place a few times a week on Binhai Avenue and Nanshan. There's always a line up of non Shenzhen cars outside blocking the rest of the road waiting to park. I'm guessing this is a tourist park for Shenzhen...",

          "I live close to the park and ride it every weekday weather permitting. I ride it from SeaWorld to The Mangrove end/start. A total of 16 KM. Biking is not allowed on the weekend because of the large crowds but weekdays it is perfect. Clean and well maintained with excellent",
          "To me this kind of place would be a great spot for a local to take an evening walk, to run, or to bike, but there just wasn't much to draw a tourist here. We went (as tourists), and there are views of the bay, and it was nice walking near the water, and seeing the park-theme",
          "Picnics, bike riding or a walk, The Shenzhen Bay Park is wonderful place for family and friends. Beautiful ocean views with lush well kept backgrounds. Most relaxing of times for a morning ride and cool breeze.",
          "Too many people and extremely crowded on weekends, stay away until the week days. Guards are grumpy to non locals and it is not bike friendly",
          "but our intention for our trip here was to roll: my partner wanted to roller skate and I was going to bike along. We couldn't find a bike/skate path in the park. And we really wanted to be in the park because it's beautiful, well-maintained and away from traffic. I definitely",
          "This area is amazing! So much to do and see. Easy to get to. Whether it is for a relaxing cup of coffee or wandering around the art galleries and small intimate boutiques to having a glass of wine and listening to a local musician, this area has something for everyone!",
          "This park gives a nice view of parts of Shenzhen, some Hong Kong islands across the bay and the bridge to Hong Kong. There is not a lot to do in terms of activities but it offers a nice walk if it's not too.",
          "The park has come alive for Chinese Lunar New Year and Spring Festival Golden Week. This is a great place to walk with family and friends to enjoy the fresh air and breeze coming off the bay waters and the spectacular views. The City has also added decorations of the season,",
          "I come here at night. many people run around here at night, and the light is romatic. I should be here with my wife.",
          "Like so many of Shenzhen's wonders, this is a man made, safe, clean, sterile experience. It's a wonderful walk and it sure beats being downtown! You can bicycle on the path on the weekdays.",
          "Good for morning and evening walks and hangout. evening this place has good food options to eat. Local currency is advisable to be taken. Vegetarian food is not available much.",
          "We go here once or twice a month. It\u2019s a lovely place to take the dog for the walk or ride a bike. We like to frequent there at night to view the lights from Shenzhen and Hong kong.",
          "Enjoyable walk, lots of greenery and beautiful sunset. The park is very big, hence, come prepared with a good pair of walking shoes. If possible, put on long pants to avoid unwanted bites from unknown flies. I have 8 bites on my 2 legs (very itchy and blistered later on) because",

          "i was there in national holiday so it was really interesting... but I don't know how much interesting in another times",
          "I like to ride my bike there (only during the weekdays, as they are forbidden during the weekends). Almost 20 km of a direct bike road. The best thing is that you can do it even late night, as Shenzhen is an amazingly safe city!",
          "The park has some beautiful views of Shenzhen and across the bay to Hong Kong. When I went it was National Day so it was very busy, however at a quieter time I am sure it is more relaxing. The Forrest area and water is beautiful, the paths stretch for miles. It\u2019s a great place",
          "Great view of the city along with very well maintained beds of flowers. Highly recommend visiting. There were a decent number of people, but the areas are quite spacious.",

          "I live here, So we do this alot. It is a great view and sun set is the best. Get a bike and go cruise.",
          "This is a pleasant view point. Easy to reach from most points in this huge megalopolis. Compared to several other parks and gardens in city; this is a bit crowded and overly paved. The egrets alone are worth a visit. Skip the theme parks and relax here.",
          "This is a very beautiful place, beyond my imagination. Next time I want to recommend it to my colleagues and friends.",
          "Really relaxing boardwalk. You can rent bikes and bike around. There are some food stands near by for snack type food. No great restaurants close by. Take an umbrella because the sun can get hot there.",
          "A beautiful waterfront promenade over looking the sea witih Hong Kong on the other side for people to walk as exercise or leisure. Small garden and open areas adjoining it for people to picnic and put up tents and park cars. Worth a Walk!",

          "A great place to chill on a humid day. Extensive views across the water to Hong Kong. Gardens and lawns line the esplanade, making it an ideal location for a picnic. Lots of birds to watch in the park and the waters edge. Our only major disappointment was being barred from",

          "This place remembered me with Pasir Ris Bay Area in Singapore, but much smaller and only few trees and gardens. After spending more than 9 months in China, this place was enough giving me relief of missing beach. You can do an interesting photography of birds flying around this",
          "You can pretty much walk forever, or run. Early morning walks are recommended as it gets crowded throughout the day. Steer clear on public holidays as it gets excessively crowded.",
          "You can walk or bicycle along this promenade for over 20 km. Water on one side, with views across to HK, thoughtfully designed parks on the other side. There is piped in music, beautiful uplighting at night. Bicycles are not allowed on the weekends when it is most crowded. It's",
          "Since they opened the full walk in 2017 it is now an amazing walk & ride along the sea. Bikes every now & then prohibited though. Really nice they opened the missing pieces between Hilton & Shenzhen Bay bridge",
          "Came here to watch the sunset. Very easy to get here by metro (Line 9- Shenzhen Bay Park). The shore is very rocky, but there is a nice sidewalk that will allow to walk for miles.",

          "This is a long park with two sections,being Shenzhen Bay Coastal Recreation Zone on its south-west side and Hongshulin Coastal Ecological Park on its eastern side.. There are beautiful flowers, trees, and views along the length of the walkway. We went for a three-hour walk,",
          "I've been in Shenzhen bay (Shenzhen Wan) couple of times. It's a great place for many type of activities. I went there to fly a kite with my girlfriend, ride bicycle with my classmates and today i'm there to fly a drone. Really great place for couples, friends and families! The",

          "It's refreshing to have a place like Shenzhen Bay park to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. People go there in the evenings to relax and unwind. Walk, bike, or sit down and look out over the water and the view of the bay. There are also plenty of places along the",
          "Shenzhen Bay boardwalk and walking trail leading from north to south from the DaShe River to Shekou and east to west from junction to Futian District. The costal trail is perfect for long distance running and biking.",
          "Nice place to walk it cycle when the weather is good . During week days you can rent bicycles to ride along the sea . The Walk / Bike Way goes for about 12 km mostly along the waterfront . Take note : do not visit on public holidays . It is chaos and over crowded.",

          "It was a sunny day and really hot. Bring some sunblocks cream. Here you can rent a bike. I was driving around for two hours and i payed only 30 RMB. The nature around is beautiful but the sea is dirty...not for swimming.",

          "perfect city for relax, walk and for business, this is truly nice place, even beach is a little far, but view from bay is great. Park is beautiful like all parks in Shenzhen",

          "Do find some time to visit this place. You can get a perfect skyline view of Shenzhen Bay and also Futian CBD. Stunning view. And also the Hong Kong bridge. Totally worth coming and a picture perfect place to grab a photo. Surprisingly, this place is very very clean.",
          "Get out early (especially on weekends) to enjoy about 20km of running, walking, or biking paths. The boardwalks tend to fill up fast in the mid-morning and throughout the day with Chinese meandering and clogging the boardwalks. There seems to be a 3-5k race every Sat/Sun...",
          "actually a hideaway in the middle of the City. A pretty busy hide away, but still cozy, nice atmosphere. You can rent bikes, many kiosks, cafes, but not overly commercialized. It's still a piece of nature and a kind of peaceful. As an alternative to the malls and other",
          "The amenities here are fantastic: to see Honk Kong Bridge and the harbors, to bike along the sidewalks, to watch people as they walk hand in hand, to learn about the fauna and flora of the harbour, to enjoy tea at various cafes along the bay, and take in the sun rays and have a",
          "Like many other Shenzhen attractions, the park is easily reached by the Shenzhen Metro, which has a stop directly in the park. From the exit it is a very short walk to a promenade along Shenzhen Bay. You can also see the new bridge from the mainland to Hong Kong. A great place",
          "If I had to stay in Shenzhen longer, this would have become my favorite place to visit at week-ends to stroll along the waterfront or through the mangrove forest, jog, ride a bicycle or just relax with my family and friends at one of the multiple lawns. There is an IMAX cinema",
          "If you're looking for a good place to go for a jog or ride your bike, this is the place. It has a 20+ km strand for walking and biking. Usually very crowded in the evenings and on weekends, so navigating on a bike at high speed can be difficult.",
          "The bay is very large and so quiet. It is a very good place for relax. We rode bicycles there and visited the wonderful night views. But you'd better protect yourself from the mosquitoes during hot days.",
          "We traveled out by metro and a short walk takes you to the sea view promenade - wide paths along the seashore with many trees and shelters to provide respite from the sun - toilets and various food and drink stall available. A nice change once you've had your fill of the hustle",

          "Have a beautiful view. Unfortunately, we went there is a wrong timing...A very hot weather, can't really enjoy it. Suggest visit in the morning or late evening!",
          "I went there for a short sunset walk during my one-day trip to Shenzhen and it's a really pleasant place to see. The park itself is nice but the boulevard with views towards the bay and HK are just lovely! If you're not into theme parks or shopping while in Shenzhen, definitely",
          "We took the metro to Hongshuwan Metro Line 2 late afternoon then walked South to Shenzhen Bay Park. Then we walked East, stopping several times to watch the families, joggers and cyclists enjoying the end of the day. As the night fell it was magical looking both East and West",
          "Great views across the bay to HK, be prepared for plentyof people also taking a stroll and cycling. No activities, just a lovely walk in the breeze as an escape from the city.",
          "Totally worth to try! It is a nice park with the view to Hong Kong!You can rent a bike there and bike from Nanshan to Futian District or viceversa. I suggest not to go on Weekends as it is very crowed and does not give you the opportunity to enjoy the nature and view.",
          "we walked all of it in one day. the park is great but it smells awfully in some parts of it. loads of benches and cycle hire places",
          "Visited Bay Park on Friday afternoon with my host father who lives in Shenzhen. I was in awe of the views and found it absolutely stunning to be able to see so far. There are many piers to stop and take photos, there are a few vendors to stop for food or drink and you can hire",
          "It is our weekly biking destination. Great sea view with as glimpse of HK. It is a well-planned park so getting there is so easy.",
          "One of the best Ecological Parks in China! I enjoyed walking along the bay and jogged in the morning for 5 km or more! The total length was said to be 18km but I think it's only about 15km. The cool breeze keeps you a bit cool on a humid summer day. Other than the humidity, I",
          "More than 10 kilometers long seaside view makes you so relaxed to enjoy the nature. The park is so long to have different parts that you will find different funs on each part. To watch birds and blooming flowers in spring, to take bicycling and walking in autumn and winter, even",
          "Bring your bike and come when the kids are in school. Ideally you need to go on a week day when the crowds are away. This is a really nice view of the bay and you go all the way down to the huge bridge that goes to HK. If you're there at the weekends watch out for the tandem",
          "A long park, or several parks built along the coastline of Shenzhen Bay, total length is about 17 km. Great coastal view and you can Hong Kong on most of the days. With your wife, or girl friend, or your kids, walking or bicycling. Good weather or bad.",
          "Park is more for strolling along a long coastline than for large open family areas. Many people are renting the bikes to travel the park as it is very long and narrow. Annoying to walk and dodge bikes!",
          "Beautiful place to walk along the coast. Ducks and birds and plenty of greenery. Recommend riding a bike there also. I've walked it at day and night. Really reminded me of home. Top 10 thing to do in sz in my opinion",
          "Nice plant selection and refreshing bay breezes. Very clean. Lots of people - became increasingly more crowded as the afternoon progressed (which seems true for most of the parks).",
          "I recomend to rent a bicycle and ride around the bay on the boardwalk.You can stop and relax as there are plenty of benches along the way.Its a great place to exercise too.",
          "It is nice to get to stroll down a park next to the ocean after a huge dinner. This is the spot and there is a lot of locals here so it is pretty safe at least to me it felt that way.",
          "A nice place to hire a bike and take a leisurely cycle along the coast. It's not the most picturesque place in Shenzhen, but it's worth a trip on a sunday evening.",
          "Both the day and night are excellent times to visit. Though, be warned, it can get packed with locals. The view is wonderful and it's a great place to walk, jog, ride a bike, or just sit and enjoy the moment and view. It may be difficult catching a taxi when you leave so using",
          "from Seaworld to Futian - with possible extension both ends - best flat cycle path in Shenzhen. Recommend week days as weekends too crowded.",
          "This is a great park with many paths that can be used for both walking and cycling... It is about 10.7 km from one end to the other along Shenzhen Bay from Shekou to Qiao Cheng Dong... It can be very crowded Monday - Friday between 17:00 and 22:00... On the weekends it is",
          "A very beautiful and new park for cycling. Simply hire a bike for yourself or for 2 persons and 1 child and go. You can go to the \u00dcniversiade statue and to the suspension bridge connecting Hongkong with China. For a nice day out of the busy Shenzhen",
          "It is a large sidewalk along the coast, which can provide a beautiful view of the bay, if you are lucky to go there in a sunny day. Besides a relaxing walk, not so much to do there. Apparently you can rent bikes as well, even I havent seen any shops there. If you dont have much",
          "I had a pleasant and relaxed walk here while staying at the Hotel Kapok Shenzhen Bay. The walk wends its way alongside the coast with views across to HongKong. There was, to its detriment, a slightly unpleasant smell much of the time but it was fun to see so many locals",
          "Stretching from the Futian Mangrove Ecological Park in the east to the Shenzhen-Hongkong Bridge in Nanshan in the west, the newly opened and currently undergoing development Shenzhen Bay Park (\u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) is the longest coastal park in Shenzhen. The park incorporates the Mangrove",
          "We started at the Mangrove Nature Reserve and walked for 6km along the shore on a sunny day and forgot the sunblock. It was good to walk by the sea with the cooling breeze. They are planting thousands of mature trees which are good now but will be fantastic in 10 years time."

          "Often a little too busy, SeaWorld is very popular with tourists visiting Shenzhen. Be sure to enjoy the light, water and fire display around the boat - I think it's at 19:00 daily, if not more often than that. Some of Shenzhen's best restaurants and bars are here.",
          "Don't let the name fool you. SeaWorld has nothing to do with the sea with the exception of an extremely old cruise ship that was brought in and turned into a hotel. The past 10 years has seen this area in Shekou transform into a world class entertainment area. There are",

          "That's all there is here, and coffee shops. There is a huge boat that's a bar and restaurant (and possibly a hotel too). I can't see why you would want to bring kids here. They'll be bored and then fall into the water. The name implies that there might be an aquarium - there",
          "Sea world everything from the good restaurants to entertaining night clubs to sleazy bars and worse. All within less than a square kilometre. What started as a free haven for ship and oil rig staff off duty has now become the place to go for expats. Best see for yourself...",

          "There doesn't seem to be a whole lot to do in this area of Shenzhen so Sea World is a welcomed spot. There are a number of great hotels and many western chains. If you done speak mandarin, this is the place to be as most people speak English.",

          "Had a great time in sea world , visited many decent restaurants , good local bars and night clubs , always plenty to do and see during the night time. Prices were spot on for a place with a good mix of westerners and locals. Found a good bar just up the street fom Sea World ,",

          "Please research before you get caught up on the hype of the name \"Seaworld\". This attraction is not your original idea of what you expect Seaworld to look like if you have ever been to the real Seaworld. This location has multiple restaurants, bars, cafe's, nightclubs for",
          "I always go to SeaWorld at least once on my trips to south China and get my fix for all the European food I've been missing. Shekou, being an expat center, can support all sorts of foreign restaurants, so whatever your preference, they have it. There is a light show several",

          "I visited Seaworld several times. Why? Because it' s beautiful. Many restaurants to visit. A great ship is in the center. On this ship you can eat at several restaurants. During the week there is a lightshow in the water thats around. From the center you can walk to and climb",
          "Is it over rated - probably BUT it's a great place to go. Restaurants from all over the world - we chose Japanese but there is literally everything here. If you go at night the water and light shows are great and it has a really nice atmosphere too.",
          "Seaworld has a long history in Shenzhen as one of the places where a lot of expats gather. It's been growing a lot lately with the addition of a lot of restaurants. Before it used to be a central square in front of a marooned ship but now there's a lot of expansion around it. It",
          "Most visitors come to Shenzhen for business reasons. Sea World feels out of place in a positive way. Imagine beer garden out door dining with lots of options for western food. Since Shenzhen is warm all year round, it is a great location for open space dining. As it is a bit far",
          "This was a pleasant discovery. Never heard of the place before but was told by a friend to try and so we stayed here for 2 nights-3 days at the Hilton nearby. Basically the whole area is a collection of restaurants, bars, nightlife, some shops and spa. Whilst you can walk around",

          "Sea World is essentially just a square with lots of restaurants and a cruise ship moored in the middle. Light and water show is on Tues-Sun at 19:00, 19:30 and 20:00 and is a bit of fun.",

          "The international cuisine here is endless (albeit at international prices) but well worth a visit for dinner. There is a water & light show a few times each night.",
          "This is a very good place if you're looking for some Western food and at the same time like to see some wonderful fountains. Several times during the day and 3 times in the evening you'll have a most wonderful dancing musical fountain special on the water in this shopping",
          "We had dinner here on board the ship and was quite pleasant. Food was good, but the fountain display made up for it. Keep in mind that Shenzhen traffic may cause delays getting here if you are driving.",
          "The evening light and music performance at this attraction is amazing and not to be missed! It is most easily accessible by the underground tube. There are plenty of food outlets in the area with an international range of choice.",

          "Must come to Sea World if you travel to Shenzhen. This is a vessel, a real vessel on land. At night, this place is fantastic.",
          "We actually just stumbled upon this looking for a restaurant. This area is the place to be if you want to meet up with other ex-pats. At the end of the day its a ship with restaurants around it. Nothing exciting.",
          "With a stroller it is impossible to navigate. Stairs are everywhere without elevator or escalator... For elders or babies it is not convenient at all. A lot of western restaurants which is great even if sometimes it is expensive. By the way, because it is pedestrian area,",
          "You can find every kinds of food there. There price was cheap and the place was clean and well decorated. It was a good place for shopping and relaxation that might find every thing there.",
          "We we're staying in a hotel nearby and hence we take a walk along sea world. The ship in the evening light up really nicely. There are plenty of eateries around here. However there is nothing special",
          "Not really my first time in the place but it never failed to amazed me everytime I go there. The Ship that you well see from the entrance of the place is the landmark of the place and you shouldn't forget to take pictures with you\ud83d\ude09. There's plenty of of restaurants to choice",

          "Sea World has quite a nice theme. Located in Shekou, with direct access to the metro system, Sea World is the home to the Ming Hua, a Chinese cruiser that is located in a pool and contains a couple of bars, restaurants and a hotel. If you're going for the food and not the",
          "This is a Shopping center!! One of my colleague thought this was like the Sea World in the states and decided to plan a trip to make it out here. There is a huge ship that is also a restaurant and have random water shows. But, other then that it is a shopping center.",
          "I visited this in the evening. They had a nice water and light show and had a lot of places to eat in the vicinity. The ship is close to the pier and so nice place to take a walk as well. Lots of places to eat close by and very lively from a people perspective.",

          "This place deliberately has avoided giving space over to retailers. Which means it's got a great buzzy atmosphere in the evening. Built in totally reclaimed land, the ship that you see in the photo has been sat there for decades, and has finally been renovated along with this",
          "This is a very nice place for friends, family, business, couples or solo, a lot of nice restaurants with different favor there. And there is a night music spray fountain at 7 pm, 8pm and 9pm. if you want some nice beers, just go to there as well, the Boat has a very nice German",
          "When Im in Shenzhen I always stay in Seaworld area. Its much more western, and also has lots of good restaurants. Its not a typical chinese experience, but after working in GuangZhou its a great place to get a more western experience of China. Also the mountain behind Seaworld",
          "This is a fantastic place for anyone who is not American...or any American missing home. If you want a taste of China, this is not it. This is a very nice mall/walkway with lots of delicious restaurants all around. There are Mexican places, Pizza Hut, McDonald's, KFC, Baskin",

It is located in near Xili Lake in Xili Subdistrict. and covers an area of 1.2 million square meters. It is the first zoo in China to have uncaged animals. There are over 300 species and more than ten thousand animals in the zoo, including endangered ones such as Giant Pandas and South China tigers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe zoo first opened on September 28, 1993. Since 2004, the zoo's black swans have been engaged in a commensal relationship with the koi found in the zoo's waters. The swans had originally begun dipping their food pellets into the water to moisten the texture, and as a result, the koi learned to swim up to the swans and eat the pellets.In November 2011, Chinese newspaper The Global Times reported that the park's management had sent requests to other Chinese zoos, asking for respective mates to be delivered for a ruffed lemur and a chimpanzee held in their zoo.On May 1, 2014, a lioness in the park gave birth to three cubs and neglected to care for them. Park workers had begun bottle-feeding the cubs in order to keep them nourished. A local pet store sent a Golden Retriever to care for the cubs, and the dog was accepted by the cubs as their surrogate mother on May 16.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nOn October 2, 2014, a horse that was pulling tourists in a heavy carriage in the zoo, for the twelfth time that day, collapsed and died. The tourists, as well as some of the zoo's security guards, concluded that the horse's death was a result of overworking and malnourishment.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of parks in Shenzhen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShenzhen Safari Park (in Chinese)",

          "Not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place. Easy access using public transport (even for English people). Entry was reasonably priced at 200 RMB for an adult, you only have to pay extra to do activities such as feed or interact with the animals which there was no",
          "Shenzhen zoo is Nanshan district, can take metro to Xili station and further take cab - about 15 mins drive. It is nice place, but ticket price (RMB200) is not worth it. Park is non smoking with designated areas for smoking, still can see Chinese people smoking all over park.",
          "Recently visited the Shenzhen wild life Park. The park its self looked very tired and in need of repair. Many enclosures were concrete or gravel. Didn't watch the show as it involved trained bears and we all observed some abuse of 2 bears away from public view. That was enough",
          "This place is huge! Great day out - we were there for about 4 hours. Lots of things to do including interacting with the animals (feeding them, you could ride them - although we didn't agree with this at all..). Majority of animals are in good conditions with lots of space but",
          "The zoo is in good condition, the animals look good. For RMB 20 you can take a bus around the zoo. For RMB 50 you can feed the tigers (totally worth it!). The only thing is that not many people speak english and the ATM doesn't work for foreign cards. It's easy to find a taxi",
          "Its called Shenzhen Safari park. Entry is bit expensive but lots of animals and well kept Zoo. Check for Dolphin show and Tiger safari timing which happens in afternoon. They take you in the tiger area in a caged bus. The tiger come over from all side.",
          "This is a fun day out. Set in a beautiful fairly well groomed park the animals appear to be very happy and well managed so no disappointments. The Pandas were a delight to watch - fun playing and eating whilst the highlight is for s small fee to hop into a caged truck and drive",
          "The park was clean and tidy, not very many people around. It was quite nice to walk around but did look a little run down. I was only there for a short time to visit the Panda. He seemed Ok and was awake and playing which was nice. Its worth a visit if your in the area, i may",
          "I will not say that it is the best place however it is a decent place to visit specially with kids. Most of the Animals are in good shape, the atmosphere is very nice. So many things to do, lots of shows. I was not very impressed with Dolphin shows though, it was below average.",
          "This park is great. Take the subway to University Town station. Park is about 1.4kms from station but a nice straight walk along the main road. Park will be indicated on top road signs. Everyone loved it. Plenty of animals in good shape and very close to see. There are some free",
          "I don't share the bad comments on this zoo. What is the main thing you're looking for in a zoo? Animals? in good shape, in great diversity and in great number right? Well that's exactly what you'll find in this zoo! Yes the equipment and decoration on some parts might seem a bit",
          "This zoo is great if you want to br hands on and feed different animals including tigers. It is not up to the high standard of an international zoo and needs some improvements. We feed lions, tigers and elephants. Worth it",
          "The zoo brought back memories from the 70s! The place was dated and some bits deserted. However, I do enjoyed the shows and feeding the tigers. We paid RMB20 per person to get access on the buses that take tourists around, but they were not in sight frequently. So we ended",
          "I stayed in Luohu and the journey by car was about 45 min. Kinda long ride. Please note of the Peak hours. The zoo is big with satisfied number of animals who have their own good space and enclosure. There are show times which are highlights of the visit including animal circus.",
          "This probably would have been better if we had more then 30 minutes to stop here, unfortunately it was part of a day tour and we stopped here just to see the two Pandas. The gardens are well maintained and it looks like the park is well maintained too, but as I said it was a",
          "I stayed in Shenzhen for 12 days and this is by far the best thing I did. The zoo was amazing, the main reason being that aswell as seeing the animals you could also interact them. By paying an extra 10-20 RMB it was possible to feed both giraffes, bears and elephants, and for",
          "Everything here was old and lack of renovation, it maybe a popular place in the 90's but not now for sure. We went to a so called \"Historical Museum\", the attendant was sitting there playing his mobile like he doesn't care about this place, there was no air-condition and",
          "Animals are in poor condition, regretted after few minutes walking there and see those poor things with lousy conditions. i recommend not to go!",
          "Based on the reviews here I visited the Zoo with a friend. The fastest way to get to the zoo from the city center is by subway to \"University Town\". From there either walk (15 min), take bus 43 or taxi (6 min). Entrance fee was 200 CNY. The park is quite large and divided into",
          "We loved this Zoo with some safari experience thrown in. Kids enjoyed it thoroughly and couldn't stop smiling all day. You can choose to see whole of the zoo on foot but with young kids we weren't sure if they will last the whole day. We took a horse cart ride (extra fee) to",
          "My 6-year-old just loves animals. Unfortunately, there is no zoo in Hong Kong, so I constantly find myself visiting zoos when we do out-of-town trips. I have been to quite a few in Japan, Thailand, Singapore, China, Australia, and Taiwan. I give this zoo a 5 star because it",
          "great zoo by Chinese standards! great feeding the bears and the lions,tigers! good mix of animals! have been three times now and love visiting! will be back! ligers are awesome!",
          "Zoos in China are unlike anything in the States. At the Shenzhen Wild-life zoo you are able to get very close to many of the animals. The highlight of this zoo is it's tiger exhibit. For 50RMB you can ride in an enclosed truck through the tiger, lion, and liger enclosures. The",
          "We took young children to the zoo. They enjoyed it. There's no doubt that some of the enclosures were too small but they were the older ones. The newer developments were much better - like the red pandas - and there seemed to be more building work going on. I hope they continue",
          "We loved feeding the bears from inexpensive bowls of canteloupe and sweet potatoes. We tossed the food down from our perch and aimed for the bear with the cutest tricks. I liked the one who looked like he was clasping his paws in prayer. They seemed to take turns most of the",
          "I've been to the zoo in Guangzhou and this one is not as good but its still not bad. If you want to see some animals but don't want to go to Guangzhou then check this one out. I like that at Chinese zoos you can get up close and touch a lot of the animals. Carnivore section was",
          "I'm writing this review to express my disapointment at how some of the animals in this zoo are treated. The lion and tiger enclosure is one of the most popular in the zoo. There is a 'tour bus' that visitors can take to get closer to the animals. During our visit we saw the",
          "The Zoo is just like any other zoo..I was disappointed because I could not found panda in the zoo \uf04c My amazing experience started when we decided to go for safari. There is a separate fee for that and that experience was worth of each penni we paid for that safari ride. They",
          "The zoo is spread over a nice amount of land giving animals more freedom than many urban zoos. My wife loves it. I didn't care much for it. Be prepared for a lot of walking. If I were just visiting I would have to pass.",
          "This place would put a 19th Century circus to shame. Tigers are forced to perform to loud music, bears ride bicycles, monkeys jump through flaming hoops. Many animals look malnourished and desperate. I felt like I was in North Korea. Truly, inexpressibly and indelibly shameful."

          "It is the saddest zoo!  Some enclosures are so small and I did not watch the dolphin/seal show and there are other shows with Bears and Tigers.  It\u2019s just so wrong on so many levels.  The only good thing is the wide variety of animals.  It\u2019s very close to the metro if you have difficulties calling a cab at closing time.",

The museum is named after He Xiangning, former leading person in the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT, wife of assassinated leader of the KMT left, Liao Zhongkai, mother of the late Overseas Chinese Commission Head Liao Chengzhi, and an amateur artist. It is the first national art museum in China to be named after a person. Its collections include some artworks by He Xiangning herself and it holds regular exhibitions and display of various contemporary art.\n\n\n== Nearby ==\nThe museum is located in the Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) area. Before the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the Overseas Chinese Town area was a State Fram administered by the Overseas Chinese Commission. The relationship between He Xiangning and the then head of the Overseas Chinese Commission, her son Liao Chengzhi, is one reason for the naming of the Gallery after her.

It spans much of the coastline of Nanshan and Futian districts. It runs along much of the length of Binhai and Binhe Boulevards and occupies an area of 108\uff0e07 hectares (267.0518 acres).\nThe park is divided into two sections, namely Shenzhen Bay Coastal Recreation Zone (\u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u6ee8\u6d77\u4f11\u95f2\u5e26) at its South West side and Hongshulin Coastal Ecological Park (\u7ea2\u6811\u6797\u6d77\u6ee8\u751f\u6001\u516c\u56ed) at its Eastern side. The latter is situated within the Hongshulin Nature Reserve, a habitat of numerous endangered bird species and is also known for its mangrove.\nThe entire area of the park opened on August 6, 2011, days before the 2011 Summer Universiade that took place in Shenzhen. The Hongshulin Coastal Ecological Park was opened earlier in December 2000. The entire length of the park is motor vehicle-free. Cycle paths and picnic spaces are featured along the park.\nThe park offers a panoramic view covering the Shenzhen skyline and New Territories, Hong Kong.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of parks in Shenzhen\n\n\n== References ==",

It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.\nShenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy\u2014made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of \"reform and opening-up\" in 1979. The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media China's Silicon Valley. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s, and has been ranked second on the list \"top 10 cities to visit in 2019\" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon. In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special economic zone. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000, but local police and authorities estimate the population at about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Evergrande Group, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD. Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index. It has the third busiest container port in the world.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest known recorded mention of the name zhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields \"zhen\" (Chinese: \u5733; lit.: 'ditch, drain'). Shenzhen was named after a deep (Chinese: \u6df1; lit.: 'deep') drain that was located within the area.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to Ming era ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Since then, this area has seen human activity from more than 6,700 years ago, with Shenzhen's historic counties first established 1,700 years ago, and the historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, which was built on the area that is now Shenzhen, established more than 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.\nIn 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin Dynasty, the area went under the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai County, one of three counties that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai County into two counties: Dongguan County in the north and Bao'an County in the south, with both under the administration of Dongguan Prefecture. In 590, the Sui administration merged Dongguan County and Bao'an County back into Nanhai County, and set the local government in the town of Nantou, though this was reversed by the Tang administration in 757.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the Yuan Dynasty. In the early Ming era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou. In 1573, the Ming administration dissolved Bao'an County to establish Xin'an County, based in Nantou, which had authority over regions that would be Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Xin'an County's economy primarily was based on the production and trade of salt, tea, spices, and rice.\n\n\n=== Qing-era to 1940s ===\nTo prevent a rebellion from Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, on the Chinese coast, the recently established Qing administration re-organized coastal provinces. As a result, Xin'an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan County and was later incorporated into Dongguan in 1669, though Xin'an was restored about 15 years later, in 1684. As of 1688, there were 28 towns in Xin'an County, of which one of the towns is named Shenzhen. When the Qing lost to the United Kingdom in both Opium Wars in 1842 and 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island were ceded from Xin'an to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking. On 21 April 1898, the Qing government signed a \"Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong's Borders\" with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin'an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Shenzhen was occupied by the British under Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of Hong Kong for half-a-year in 1899. From the 3,076 square kilometres (1,188 sq mi) of territory that Xin'an held before the treaties, 1,055.61 square kilometres (407.57 sq mi) of the county's land was ceded to the British.\n\nIn response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin'an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public, and the last stop of the Chinese side, named Shenzhen Railway Station at the town of Shenzhen, which had opened recently, helped the town's economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin'an County back to Bao'an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province. During the Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931, Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino. While only in operation until 1936, they significantly increased KCR's passenger traffic to and from Shenzhen.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao'an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong. When Japan surrendered on May 1945, the Bao'an County government moved back to Nantou. \n\n\n=== 1950s to 1970s ===\nIn 1953, four years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Bao'an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the city was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao'an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.\nIn January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the \"Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report\" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the \"Report on the Request for the Change of Bao'an County to Shenzhen\". On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.\nOn 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose \"to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading\" based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng's leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.\nAt the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a \"trade cooperation zone\" in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the \"Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income\" and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration.\n\n\n=== Special Economic Zone (1980s\u2013present) ===\n\nIn May 1980, the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as an SEZ, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\". On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the \"Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.\" Under these regulations, Shenzhen formulated a series of preferential policies to attract foreign investment, including business autonomy, taxation, land use, foreign exchange management, product sales, and entry and exit management. Through the processing of incoming materials, compensation trade, joint ventures, cooperative operations, sole proprietorship, and leasing, the city has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and helped popularize and enable rapid development of the SEZ concept.\n\nIn March 1981, Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial city. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). In November 1988, Shenzhen became a separate city (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02), meaning that the city can implement policies that are different from those in the national plan, and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration.In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials' Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen's administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.On 1 July 2010, the State Council dissolved the \"second line,\" and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.\" In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly-established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.On 18 August 2019, the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economical, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, intending to have the SEZ be a model city for others in China to follow.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.\nOver 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River, Maozhou River and Longgang River.Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most of them fall under the territory of neighbouring areas such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. But there are several islands under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou. (See List of islands in Shenzhen)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlthough Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 10 July 1980.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Shenzhen is structured in a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary (currently Wang Weizhong), outranks the Mayor (currently Chen Rugui). The party's standing committee acts as the top policy formulation body, and is typically composed of 11 members.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nShenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative Districts and one New District:\n\nSpecial Economic Zone Border\nTo enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.\nOn 1 July 2010, the original SEZ border control was cancelled, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to the whole city. The area of Shenzhen SEZ thus increased from 396 square kilometres (153 sq mi) to 1,953 square kilometres (754 sq mi). Since June 2015 the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ. Although the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been extended to cover the whole of Shenzhen, colloquially Shenzhen is still said to be separated into two areas, with the original four districts comprising the SEZ before 2010 as \"simplified Chinese: \u5173\u5185; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u5167; pinyin: gu\u0101n n\u00e8i; Jyutping: gwaan1 noi6; lit.: 'within the border') and the rest known as \"\u5173\u5916; \u95dc\u5916; gu\u0101n w\u00e0i; gwaan1 ngoi6; 'outside of the border').\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShenzhen was the first of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to be established by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As a SEZ, Shenzhen is given the privilege to embrace market capitalism policies under the guise of \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,\" unlike other cities in Mainland China which is based on a planned economy. As of 2018, Shenzhen has a nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion), which recently had surpassed neighboring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 2.29 trillion RMB (HK$2.68 trillion), making the economic output of Shenzhen the third largest out of Chinese cities, trailing behind Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, Shenzhen's GDP growth between 2016 and 2017 of 8.8% surpassed that of Hong Kong and Singapore, with 3.7% and 2.5% respectively. With a market capitalization of US$2.5 trillion as of 30 November 2018, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is the 8th largest exchange in the world.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nShenzhen's industry is described by its Municipal Bureau of Statistics to be upheld by its four-pillar industries: high-tech, finance, logistics, and culture. Shenzhen is primarily known for its high-tech industry, which has a value of 585.491 billion RMB (US$82.9 billion) in 2015, a 13% increase compared to last year. Out of the nominal GDP of 1,750.299 billion RMB in 2015, the high-tech industry comprises 33.4% of this amount. Shenzhen is home to a number of prominent tech firms, such as telecommunications and electronics corporation Huawei, internet giant and holding conglomerate Tencent, drone-maker DJI, and telecommunications company ZTE. Shenzhen annually holds the China International High-tech Achievements Fair, which showcases high-tech products and provides for dialogue and investment for high-tech. As a result, Shenzhen is dubbed by media outlets as \"China's Silicon Valley\" or the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware\" for the world.\nIn addition to its numerous high-tech companies, Shenzhen is also home to a number of large financial institutions, such as China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance and its subsidiary Ping An Bank. Since the city's establishment as a SEZ, a number of foreign banks had established offices in the city, including Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. In total, the financial industry accounts for 14.5% of the city's nominal GDP in 2015 (254.282 billion RMB), which was a 15.9% increase over the previous year. By the end of 2016, the total assets of the financial industry amounted to 12.7 trillion RMB (banking industry assets were 7.85 trillion RMB, security companies assets were 1.25 trillion RMB, and insurance industry assets were 3.6 trillion RMB), making Shenzhen's financial industry the third largest in China. In addition, Shenzhen is one of the world's top ten financial centers as of 2019, jumping five places to ninth place as determined by \"variety of areas of competitiveness, including business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial sector development and reputation.\"Addressing the logistics industry, courier SF Express and shipping company China International Marine Containers (CIMC) have their headquarters in Shenzhen.  The Port of Shenzhen, composed of Yantian International Container Terminals, Chiwan Container Terminals, Shekou Container Terminals, China Merchants Port and Shenzhen Haixing (Mawan port), handled a record number of containers with rising trade increased cargo shipments in 2005, ranking it as the world's third-busiest port. Together, the logistics industry accounts for around 10.1% (178.27 billion RMB) of the city's nominal GDP in 2015, which was an increase of 9.4%.Shenzhen had prioritized the cultural industry in according to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and planning the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. On 7 December 2008, UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network, and awarded the Shenzhen the title of \"United Nations Design Capital.\" Altogether, the cultural industry in turn contributes to 5.8% (102.116 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015.\nIn addition to the four pillar industries that was listed by the municipal government, Shenzhen also has a relatively notable real-estate industry. The real-estate industry altogether contributes to 9.2% (162.777 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015, which was an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Real estate developers such as Vanke and China Resources Land are headquartered within the city.\nAs a SEZ, Shenzhen has established several industrial zones to encourage economic activities. The Shekou Industrial Zone was approved and established back in 31 January 1979 by the Central Committee of the CPC to assist in the \"Hong Kong-based\" economy of Shenzhen. In 1996, the State Council approved and established the 11.5 km2 (4.4 sq mi) Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Development Zone, helping to develop Shenzhen's high-tech industry in areas such as electronics and information technology. In accordance to the National Plan in 2001, the Shenzhen Software Park, integrated within the High-tech Industrial Development Zone, was established for software production and assist in the development of the city's software industry. On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\" to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of \u2018top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its \"12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city's scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation. In 2015, the tourism industry's total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1% increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28% (35 billion RMB or US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2% from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51% increase from 2010.\n\nShenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings. Most of the tourist attractions are part of Overseas Chinese Town (OCT), a colloquial name for parks owned by OCT Enterprises and is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. These include the Window of the World, the Splendid China Folk Village, Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37), OCT East, and OCT Harbour. Other theme parks include Shekou Sea World (\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e16\u754c), Xiaomeisha Sea World, and the now-closed Minsk World. Shenzhen also has a number of popular public parks and beaches, such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, Wutongshan Park, Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa'). The city is also home to tall buildings such as the Ping An Finance Centre, KK100, and the Shun Hing Square (also known as Di Wang Tower).Shenzhen's tourism industry is recently expanding under the \"13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. Part of the plan includes organizing the tourist industry within five brands: theme parks, retail, natural recreational areas, sports, and international gatherings, as well as speeding up construction of future tourist attractions and turning Shenzhen into a Chinese hub for sports.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail is an important pillar of Shenzhen's tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen's tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion), retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen's FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.\n\nHuaqiang North (\u534e\u5f3a\u5317) is one of Shenzhen's notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world. Luohu Commercial City, a commercial complex located adjacent to Shenzhen Railway Station, is noted for having a variety of products that ranges from electronics and counterfeit goods to tailored suits and curtains. In addition to Huaqiang North and Luohu Commercial City, Shenzhen has numerous shopping malls and commercial areas, including COCO Park and its branches COCO City and Longgang COCO Park, Uniworld (\u58f9\u65b9\u5929\u5730), Uniwalk (\u58f9\u65b9\u573a), and Coastal City(\u6d77\u5cb8\u57ce).\"Smart retail\", which uses technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in production, circulation, and sales of consumer goods, has been growing popular within enterprises in Shenzhen. Businesses in Shenzhen are encouraged to use the Internet to develop the consumer market and new retail projects would be assisted with the use of technology. In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of \"smart retail\", with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a \"new retail\" hub.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nShenzhen is considered as a major innovation hub of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Over the years it has become one of the most important research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centers in the country.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nShenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China, with a population of 12,528,300 in the city as of 2017. With a total area of 1,992 km\u00b2, Shenzhen has a population density of 6,889 inhabitants per square kilometre. The encompassing metropolitan area of the city was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 23.3 million. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world's largest urban area according to the World Bank, and has a population of over 108.5 million according to the 2015 census.Before Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. However, since become a SEZ, Shenzhen has become a hub for migrants searching for work and opportunities within the city.\n\n\n=== Historic ===\nThere had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is Mandarin that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.\nShenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of the world's factory.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment. The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012\u201313, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a yoy increase of 500,000.\n\n\n=== Other statistics ===\nAt present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.The population structure has great diversity, ranging from intellectuals with a high level of education to migrant workers with poor education. It was reported in June 2007 that more than 20 percent of China's PhD graduates had worked in Shenzhen. Shenzhen was also elected as one of the top 10 cities in China for expatriates. Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.\nAccording to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen. Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is restricted.\nMainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an \"Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao\". Shenzhen residents can have a special 1 year multiple-journey endorsement (but maximum 1 visit per week starting from April 13, 2015) This type of exit endorsement is only issued to people who have hukou in certain regions.(See Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau.)\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n==== Koreans ====\n\nAs of 2007 there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. As of 2014 Donghai had about 200 Korean families.South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, Korean International School in Shenzhen. As of 2007 there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. As of 2014 spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nPrior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Rd. was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century. Younger generations of the Cantonese communities now speak the more standard version. Today, some aboriginals of the Cantonese and Hakka speaking communities disperse into urban settlements (e.g. apartments and villas), but most of them are still clustering in their traditional urban and suburban villages.The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city's linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism is on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers begin to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, local languages such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew are still commonly spoken among locals. Hokkien and Xiang are also sometimes observed.According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant churches, Catholic churches, and mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37% of Shenzhen's residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26% were Buddhists, 18% Taoists, 2% Christians and 2% Muslims; 15% were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn general, Shenzhen is a relatively safe city. However, in districts such as Bao'an and Longgang, the number of robberies, extortion, kidnapping, and fraud exceeds the national average. In the central part of the Luohu District, especially in the neighborhoods around the Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal, and the Luohu Commercial City Shopping Center, pickpocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. In addition, Luohu is a major center for trade in counterfeit goods and abundant in its nightclubs, bars, and karaoke salons, which not only attracts Shenzhen residents, but also residents from neighboring Hong Kong, which may attract criminal elements. The Nanshan District has a large concentration of foreigners, and is known for its abundance of prostitutes and beggars. Along with local gangs in Shenzhen, there is a notable presence of triads: notably Wo Shing Wo, Big Circle Gang, Sun Yee On, 14K, and Shui Fong. The level of corruption in the government is usually high, as seen in the arrest of the then-mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng, for accepting bribes in June 2009, as well as arrests and convictions of Li Yugo, the former head of the largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a customs officer of the city, for the same reasons.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nShenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as \"the world leader completing new skyscrapers,\" as it managed to complete 14 skyscrapers that are above 200 meters in 2018, four more than Dubai, and keeping this title for three years. In addition, the city is home to the most number of skyscrapers above 200 meters than any other cities in the world, with 82 completed as of July 2019. The city is ranked the third in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 223 of them completed as of July 2019, after Hong Kong and New York City. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 60 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2019. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599-meter, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. The second-tallest building is the Kingkey 100, rising 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and containing 100 floors of office and hotel spaces. Shenzhen is also the home to the Shun Hing Square (Diwang Building), the tallest in Asia (if the antenna is taken into account) when it was built in 1996. Guomao Building was furthermore the tallest building in China when it was completed in 1985.In addition to the Shenzhen's modern skyscrapers, Shenzhen also has a significant number of historical buildings. Chiwan Fort is located on a small seaside hill in the Nanshan District. Today, what is left only represents a fragment of the large fortress, as it was partially destroyed by the British during the Opium Wars. Tianhou Temple in the Nanshan District is dedicated to the goddess Mazu, a tutelary deity for fishermen and sailors. According to legend, the temple was founded in 1410 by Admiral Zheng He after his fleet survived a strong storm in the Pearl River Delta. The temple is repeatedly rebuilt and repaired. Part of the temple was converted to a museum, but the rest still continues to function as a religious building. The tomb of the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Bing, is located in the Nanshan district. The modern tomb dates back to the end of the 19th century, when a Hong Kong clan announced one of the imperial tombs after a long search, though this is disputed by historians. The tomb was reconstructed at the beginning of the 20th century, but later it fell into neglect until it was restored again in the 1980s. Dapin Fortress is located in the eastern part of the city, in the same area. It was built in 1394 to protect the coast from pirates and in 1571 suffered a long siege of Japanese corsairs. It later turned into a typical town during the Qing Dynasty, and during the First Opium War, the fortress garrison participated in the fight against the British. Walls and gates, narrow streets, temples, and the residence of the commandant in the fortress are still preserved today.  There is an old fortified Hakka village in the Longgang District, whose the architectural features of which are complemented by the Hakka Culture Museum.\n\nThe old town of Nantou (or Xin'an), located in the Nanshan District, has several historical sites dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. From the 4th century, there existed a significant city, but today most of the old buildings have been replaced by modern buildings. However, there are still a few historical buildings, such as fortress walls and gates dating back to the Ming period, the Guandi Temple (Guan Yu), some military and civilian buildings (for example, the residence of officials, the shop, and the opium house), and several streets.\n\n\n=== Parks and beaches ===\n\nShenzhen offers free admission to over of its twenty public city parks such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, and Wutongshan Park. The Xianhu Botanical Garden (\u4ed9\u6e56; 'Fairy Lake'), founded in 1982, is spread around the lake of the same name in the Luohu District on an area of 590 hectares. On one of the hills of the garden is Hunfa Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Shenzhen, which was built in 1985 on the site of an older shrine. Around the lake are a pagoda, tea houses, pavilions, the Museum of Paleontology, a garden of medicinal plants and an azalea garden. Wutongshan National Park (\u68a7\u6850\u5c71) is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station. Lianhuashan Park (\u83b2\u82b1\u5c71; Lotus Hill) is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of the mountain is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. The Shenzhen Garden and Flower Exposition Center, established in the Futian District in 2004 for the International Garden Exhibition, has many gardens of various styles, artificial ponds and waterfalls, a pagoda, pavilions, and statues. The Shenzhen Bay Park opened in 2011 which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay. The Shenzhen Safari Park in the Nanshan District combines a zoo and a large zoological center on a territory of 120 hectares. Xili Lake Resort (\u897f\u4e3d\u6e56), located in the Nanshan District, has a park with springs and waterfalls stretching around the lake, surrounded by a canopy, and a pagoda and a pavilion located on the top of Xili Mountain. Zhongshan Park (\u4e2d\u5c71), located in the Nanshan District, is the city's oldest park. It has several artificial lakes and ponds, an old city wall dating back to the 14th century, and many sculptures and monuments, including one of Sun Yat-sen. The Yangtai Mountain Forest Park is located around the 500-meter Yangtai Mountain (\u7f8a\u53f0\u5c71) in the Bao'an District. Nearby the mountain is Shiyan Lake (\u77f3\u5ca9\u6e56), which became a popular place of Xin'an County in the 16th century. It is famous for its several indoor and outdoor pools with hot thermal waters.Shenzhen has several beaches: Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa') in the Yantian District, and Jinshawan (\u91d1\u6c99\u6e7e; 'golden sands bay'), Nan'ao (\u5357\u6fb3; 'southern inlet'), and Xichong (\u897f\u51b2) in Dapeng Peninsula (in the vicinity of Dapeng New District, which is administered by the Longgang District).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBefore the 1980s, Shenzhen's education system was primarily based on primary and limited secondary schooling, with no residents admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. Shenzhen started implementing policies that will help develop a more high-quality education system, borrowing teachers from the best schools in the country with promises of higher pay and benefits. In addition, the city started building new schools and renovating the infrastructure of its existing schools to give teachers a more comfortable environment to teach.In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen's first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China's top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the innovative Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Institute of Technology. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.The 9-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. Secondary schools such as Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School, all of which have an on-line rate of over 90%, are dubbed as \"Shenzhen's four famous schools.\" As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools.According to Laurie Chen of the South China Morning Post, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou's count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen's by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nShenzhen is the second largest transportation hub in Guangdong and South China, trailing behind the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shenzhen has a developed extensive public transportation system, covering rapid transit, buses and taxis, most of which can be accessed by either using a Shenzhen Tong card or using QR codes generated by WeChat mini programs.\nRegarding air transport, Shenzhen is served by its own Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and the neighboring Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). Located 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the center of the city, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport serves as the main hub for passenger airlines Shenzhen Airlines and Donghai Airlines and a main hub for cargo airlines Jade Cargo International, SF Airlines, and UPS Airlines. Together, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport handled 49,348,950 passengers, 355,907 aircraft, and 1,218,502.2 cargo in 2018, making it the 5th busiest airport in China in terms of passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport in the country in terms of aircraft and cargo traffic. In addition to flying through Bao'an International Airport, ticketed passengers can also take ferries from the Shekou Cruise Centre and the Fuyong Ferry Terminal to the Skypier at Hong Kong International Airport. There are also coach bus services connecting Shenzhen with HKIA.\nThe Shenzhen Metro serves as the city's rapid transit system. The extension opened on 8 December 2019 put the network at 303.4 kilometres (188.5 miles) of trackage operating on 8 lines with 215 stations. By 2030 the network is planned to be 8 express and 24 non-express lines totalling 1142 kilometres of trackage. The average daily metro ridership in 2016 is 3.54 million passengers, which accounts for a third of public transportation users in the city. The metro also operates a tram system in the Longhua District.\n\nShenzhen is served by seven inter-city railway stations: Futian, Guangmingcheng, Pingshan, Shenzhen (also known as Luohu Railway Station) Shenzhen East, Shenzhen North, and Shenzhen West. High-speed rail (HSR) lines that go through the city are the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, and the Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen railway (forms part of the Hangzhou\u2013Fuzhou\u2013Shenzhen passenger railway). Non-HSR lines that go through Shenzhen are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway (forms part of the Kowloon\u2013Canton railway) and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.\nAs of August 2019, the city's bus system encompasses over 900 lines, with a total of over 16,000 electric vehicles, the largest of its kind in the world. The system is operated by multiple companies. As at January 2019 conversion of Shenzhen's taxi fleet to electric vehicles reached 99%. Electric taxis have a blue and white colour scheme. Petroleum fuelled taxis are coloured either green or red.Shenzhen serves as a fabric to China's expressway system. Expressways within the city include the Meiguan Expressway (part of the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway), the Jihe Expressway (part of the G15 Shenhai Expressway), the Yanba Expressway (part of the S30 Huishen Costal Expressway), the S28 Shuiguan Expressway, the Yanpai Expressway (part of the G25 Changshen Expressway and the S27 Renshen Expressway), and the S33 Nanguang Expressway. In response to being rejected from being a part of the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, Shenzhen is constructing a bridge across the Pearl River Delta to connect the city of Zhongshan.Private car ownership has been on the rise in Shenzhen, with the city having over 3.14 million cars in 2014. In response, the city imposed limits on car purchases to reduce traffic and pollution. The purchase of electric cars will be determined by a lottery, while traditional cars will be determined both a lottery and a bidding process. In addition, the city banned passenger vehicles with license plates issued in other places from four of Shenzhen's main districts during peak times on working days as of 29 December 2014.\n\nShenzhen is connected with Hong Kong (city and airport), Zhuhai and Macau through ferries that leave from and arrive at the Shekou Cruise Center. The Fuyong Passenger Terminal in the Bao'an District provide services to and from Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) and Macau (Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal). The Port of Shenzhen is the third busiest container port in the world, handling 27.7 million TEUs in 2018.Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has the largest number of entry and exit ports, the largest number of entry and exit personnel, and the largest traffic volume in China. Shenzhen is busiest in China when it comes to border crossings, with people entering and exiting the country through the city and Hong Kong reaching 239 million in 2015. In the same year, a total of 15.5 million vehicles crossed the border in Shenzhen, a 0.4% increase of last year.  Border crossing ports include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, and Luohu Port. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAs Shenzhen is located in Guangdong, the city historically has a Cantonese culture before its transition to a SEZ. Migrants coming to the city to find work and opportunities have turned Shenzhen into a cultural melting pot. Despite this, the municipal government and some of the residents living in Shenzhen, including those who are not from Guangdong, have invested in keeping and reflecting off the city's Cantonese heritage. Shenzhen has presented itself as a city of opportunity for young people in China. The competitive culture that the city promotes among the youth have resulted in the term \"Shenzhen speed,\" which describes a period of constant competition, quick changes, and high-efficiency.In 2003, the municipal government announced plans to turned Shenzhen into a cultural city by promoting design, animation, and library construction. The municipal government also intends to develop the city's cultural industry in accordance to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. Shenzhen's cultural industry specializes in being one of the largest handicraft manufacturers in China, and is also an industry center for oil painting in bases such as Dafen Village. Shenzhen also hosts the Shenzhen International Cultural Fair which specializes as an expo for the world's cultural industries, with the first expo being on November 2004. As a result of these developments, Shenzhen was awarded by UNESCO the title of \"United Nations Design Capital\" and was accepted entry into the Creative Cities Network on 7 December 2008.\n\nAs part of turning Shenzhen into a cultural city, the municipal government established the \"Library City\" (\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e4b\u57ce) concept in 2003. The plan would create a library network within the city through library construction, service improvement, and create a comfortable reading environment.  By the end of 2015, Shenzhen has 620 public libraries, including 3 city-level public libraries, 8 district-level public libraries, and 609 grassroots libraries.  Notable libraries include the Shenzhen Library and the Shenzhen Children's Library. Shenzhen also has bookstores, with the most notable being Shenzhen Book City in the Futian District. With an operating area of 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft), it claimed to be the largest bookstore of Asia at the time of its opening. Shenzhen has a number of museums and art galleries, such as the Shenzhen Museum, the Shenzhen Art Museum, the Shekou Maritime Museum, the Longgang Museum of Hakka Culture, the Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art, and the He Xiangning Art Museum. Shenzhen also has a few theaters, notably the Shenzhen Concert Hall, the Shenzhen Grand Theater, and the Shenzhen Poly Theater.\n\nAs with Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province, the main cuisine of Shenzhen is Cantonese. However, due to the recent growth of migrants to the city, Shenzhen also hosts a diverse array of cuisines, from Chinese cuisines such as Chaozhou cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hu Cuisine, and Xiang Cuisine, as well as foreign cuisines such as Korean, Japanese, French, and American. The Yantian District is known for its Chaozhou-based and Hakka-based seafood, with restaurants lined up along the coastline.  Some recreational areas in Shenzhen such as Xianhu Botanical Garden, Donghu Park, and Xiaomeisha, host barbecues where visitors bring their own food.  Street food such as Xinjiang lamb skewers, Northern Chinese pancakes, and black sesame soups, can be found in Xijie Street and the urban village of Baishizhou. Shenzhen also has its own tea culture. In regards to food chains, first McDonald's restaurant in mainland China opened for business in Shenzhen on 8 October 1990, providing the city American fast food. Shenzhen is home to the HeyTea chain of tea shops, which provides a variety of cheese and fruit teas and is popular among social media.Shenzhen has a prominent nightlife culture, with most of the activity centered in the entertainment complexes of COCO Park and Shekou, with the former being referred by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) as \"Shenzhen's answer to Lan Kwai Fong.\" There are many bars and clubs in the city, mostly unregulated, that stay open till the morning.  Tunnel raves, referred by the SCMP as \"a Shenzhen nightlife staple\", have earned a reputation in the world, though they are often cracked down by police.  Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui (\u6c99\u5634\u6751) in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShenzhen is the home to professional football team Shenzhen F.C., which participates in both China League One and the Chinese Super League. Another local football team, Shenzhen Ledman F.C., was once a part of China League Two until the club was disbanded in 2018. Shenzhen's top-tier basketball team, the Shenzhen Aviators, plays in the Southern Division of the Chinese Basketball Association. Shenzhen F.C. and the Shenzhen Aviators both are tenants of the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre.\nShenzhen Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that hosts many events. The stadium is located in Futian District and has a capacity of 32,500. It was built in June 1993, at a cost of 141 million RMB. The 26th Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen in August 2011. Shenzhen has constructed the sports venues for this first major sporting event in the city.Shenzhen Dayun Arena is a multipurpose arena.  It was completed in 2011 for the 2011 Summer Universiade.  It is used for the basketball, ice hockey and gymnastics events.  The arena is the home of the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\nShenzhen is also a popular destination for skateboarders from all over the world, due to the architecture of the city and its lax skate laws.The Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre was one of the venues at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 2019 to 2028 Shenzhen is hosting the WTA Finals, a major annual professional tennis tournament for the world's most top-ranked female players.\n\n\n== Relationship with Hong Kong ==\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below. Except where noted the statistics are taken from sections of the Hong Kong Government website.As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 teus/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary, while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.\n\nTrade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333 billion of imports of which US$298 billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card (Home Return Permit) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of Zhongshan on the Western side: the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge.\n\n\n==== Qianhai ====\n\nQianhai, which means foresea in Chinese language, formally known as the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone, is \"a useful exploration for China to create a new opening up layout with a more open economic system.\" A 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi) area located in western Shenzhen, Qianhai lies at the heart of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to Shenzhen international airport. Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta. With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from HSBC, \"This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nShenzhen has an advanced public media network, boasting one radio station, two TV stations, three broadcasting and TV centers, 19 cable broadcasting and TV sub-stations. In Shenzhen, there are 14 newspapers, one comprehensive publishing house, three video-audio products publishing houses, 88 bureaus of inland and Hong Kong media organizations, 40 periodicals, and about 200 kinds of in-house publications of which the majority belong to enterprises. The most prominent media companies in Shenzhen are the Shenzhen Media Group, the Shenzhen Press Group, China Entertainment Television (CETV), and Phoenix Television branch iFeng.Shenzhen News (\u6df1\u5733\u665a\u62a5, sznews.com) is a Chinese-language newspaper owned by the Shenzhen Press Group that serves as Shenzhen's main online new source. Shenzhen Daily is an English-language news outlet for Shenzhen. It also covers local, national and international news. That's Shenzhen is the Shenzhen edition of That's PRD, an English-language media company with an online, print and social footprint. That's Shenzhen covers news, arts, lifestyle and events in the city. ShekouDaily.com is an online media outlet providing news and resources that focus on the Shekou sub-district in Nanshan District of Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nShenzhen has been very active in cultivating sister city relationships. In October 1989, Shenzhen Mayor Li Hao and a delegation travelled to Houston to attend the signing ceremony establishing a sister city relationship between Houston and Shenzhen. Houston became the first sister city of Shenzhen. Up to 2015, Shenzhen has established sister city relationship with 25 cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Other twinnings ===\nThe Shenzhen Port is twinned and has collaboration agreements with:\n\n The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, June 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Shenzhen-related articles\nAdministrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\nEconomy of China\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPearl River (China)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBach, Jonathan (August 2010). \"\"THEY COME IN PEASANTS AND LEAVE CITIZENS\": Urban Villages and the Making of Shenzhen, China\".

        "wiki": "Nanshan District (simplified Chinese: \u5357\u5c71\u533a; traditional Chinese: \u5357\u5c71\u5340; pinyin: N\u00e1nsh\u0101n Q\u016b ;Cantonese Jyutping: Naam4 Saan1 Keoi1) is one of the nine districts comprising Shenzhen. It encompasses the southwest area of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, with a population of 1.08 million. In 2013, the district of Nanshan's local GDP output exceeded 320 billion RMB. The region has an established tourism industry and is home to several sightseeing locations.\nIt is known for being the home of Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Park, which comprises some of China's largest technology companies and the establishments of well-known international companies, as well as being one of the nation's richest districts.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nNanshan District has a total area of 182 km2 (70 sq mi). The area continued to increase due to large scale land reclamation, especially in Qianhai and Houhai. The district is located to the northwest of Deep Bay, east of the Pearl River entrance. Its northern boundary is Yangtaishan, which divides the district with Baoan, while it is bounded south by Inner Lingding Island and Dachan Island, though the Port of Shekou is the southernmost point on the peninsula. Nanshan is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer and has a humid subtropical climate. It sits directly north of Yuen Long district of Hong Kong. More than half of the district consist of urban areas. Mountainous areas like Tanglangshan and Yangtaishan to the north and Nanshan Park to the south are largely preserved as forests.\nAt 587 metres tall, Yangtaishan has the highest elevation in the district, with Tanglangshan being the second at 430 metres and third being Nanshan of height 336 metres. The district has a total coastline of 55.18 kilometres.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNanshan was largely a rural area before being rapidly developed since the late 1970s, with the exception of a few towns and villages. Nantou, the seat of Bao'an County for almost 1700 years was located within the district.\nIn September 1983, Nantou district was established; it was county-level administratively. Less than a year later in August 1984 Shekou, which came to be known as Shekou subdistrict today, split off as a separate district from Nanshan. In September 1990 the two districts combined to form the present Nanshan District.\nNanshan experienced large sums of migrants from other parts of the country. Much of the original towns in the district had either been demolished to make way for developments or became what are to be known as urban villages.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the end of 2011, Nanshan district has a total resident population of 1,087,936 and a census-registered population of 0.5492 million.

        "wiki": "Shenzhen (; Chinese: \u6df1\u5733; Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0282\u0259\u0301n.\u0288\u0282\u0259\u0302n] (listen)) is a major sub-provincial city on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.\nShenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy\u2014made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of \"reform and opening-up\" in 1979. The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media China's Silicon Valley. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s, and has been ranked second on the list \"top 10 cities to visit in 2019\" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon. In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special economic zone. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000, but local police and authorities estimate the population at about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Evergrande Group, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD. Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index. It has the third busiest container port in the world.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest known recorded mention of the name zhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields \"zhen\" (Chinese: \u5733; lit.: 'ditch, drain'). Shenzhen was named after a deep (Chinese: \u6df1; lit.: 'deep') drain that was located within the area.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to Ming era ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Since then, this area has seen human activity from more than 6,700 years ago, with Shenzhen's historic counties first established 1,700 years ago, and the historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, which was built on the area that is now Shenzhen, established more than 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.\nIn 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin Dynasty, the area went under the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai County, one of three counties that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai County into two counties: Dongguan County in the north and Bao'an County in the south, with both under the administration of Dongguan Prefecture. In 590, the Sui administration merged Dongguan County and Bao'an County back into Nanhai County, and set the local government in the town of Nantou, though this was reversed by the Tang administration in 757.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the Yuan Dynasty. In the early Ming era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou. In 1573, the Ming administration dissolved Bao'an County to establish Xin'an County, based in Nantou, which had authority over regions that would be Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Xin'an County's economy primarily was based on the production and trade of salt, tea, spices, and rice.\n\n\n=== Qing-era to 1940s ===\nTo prevent a rebellion from Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, on the Chinese coast, the recently established Qing administration re-organized coastal provinces. As a result, Xin'an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan County and was later incorporated into Dongguan in 1669, though Xin'an was restored about 15 years later, in 1684. As of 1688, there were 28 towns in Xin'an County, of which one of the towns is named Shenzhen. When the Qing lost to the United Kingdom in both Opium Wars in 1842 and 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island were ceded from Xin'an to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking. On 21 April 1898, the Qing government signed a \"Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong's Borders\" with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin'an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Shenzhen was occupied by the British under Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of Hong Kong for half-a-year in 1899. From the 3,076 square kilometres (1,188 sq mi) of territory that Xin'an held before the treaties, 1,055.61 square kilometres (407.57 sq mi) of the county's land was ceded to the British.\n\nIn response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin'an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public, and the last stop of the Chinese side, named Shenzhen Railway Station at the town of Shenzhen, which had opened recently, helped the town's economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin'an County back to Bao'an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province. During the Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931, Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino. While only in operation until 1936, they significantly increased KCR's passenger traffic to and from Shenzhen.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao'an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong. When Japan surrendered on May 1945, the Bao'an County government moved back to Nantou. \n\n\n=== 1950s to 1970s ===\nIn 1953, four years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Bao'an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the city was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao'an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.\nIn January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the \"Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report\" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the \"Report on the Request for the Change of Bao'an County to Shenzhen\". On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.\nOn 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose \"to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading\" based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng's leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.\nAt the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a \"trade cooperation zone\" in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the \"Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income\" and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration.\n\n\n=== Special Economic Zone (1980s\u2013present) ===\n\nIn May 1980, the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as an SEZ, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\". On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the \"Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.\" Under these regulations, Shenzhen formulated a series of preferential policies to attract foreign investment, including business autonomy, taxation, land use, foreign exchange management, product sales, and entry and exit management. Through the processing of incoming materials, compensation trade, joint ventures, cooperative operations, sole proprietorship, and leasing, the city has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and helped popularize and enable rapid development of the SEZ concept.\n\nIn March 1981, Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial city. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). In November 1988, Shenzhen became a separate city (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02), meaning that the city can implement policies that are different from those in the national plan, and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration.In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials' Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen's administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.On 1 July 2010, the State Council dissolved the \"second line,\" and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.\" In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly-established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.On 18 August 2019, the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economical, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, intending to have the SEZ be a model city for others in China to follow.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.\nOver 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River, Maozhou River and Longgang River.Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most of them fall under the territory of neighbouring areas such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. But there are several islands under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou. (See List of islands in Shenzhen)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlthough Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 10 July 1980.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Shenzhen is structured in a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary (currently Wang Weizhong), outranks the Mayor (currently Chen Rugui). The party's standing committee acts as the top policy formulation body, and is typically composed of 11 members.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nShenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative Districts and one New District:\n\nSpecial Economic Zone Border\nTo enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.\nOn 1 July 2010, the original SEZ border control was cancelled, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to the whole city. The area of Shenzhen SEZ thus increased from 396 square kilometres (153 sq mi) to 1,953 square kilometres (754 sq mi). Since June 2015 the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ. Although the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been extended to cover the whole of Shenzhen, colloquially Shenzhen is still said to be separated into two areas, with the original four districts comprising the SEZ before 2010 as \"simplified Chinese: \u5173\u5185; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u5167; pinyin: gu\u0101n n\u00e8i; Jyutping: gwaan1 noi6; lit.: 'within the border') and the rest known as \"\u5173\u5916; \u95dc\u5916; gu\u0101n w\u00e0i; gwaan1 ngoi6; 'outside of the border').\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShenzhen was the first of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to be established by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As a SEZ, Shenzhen is given the privilege to embrace market capitalism policies under the guise of \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,\" unlike other cities in Mainland China which is based on a planned economy. As of 2018, Shenzhen has a nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion), which recently had surpassed neighboring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 2.29 trillion RMB (HK$2.68 trillion), making the economic output of Shenzhen the third largest out of Chinese cities, trailing behind Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, Shenzhen's GDP growth between 2016 and 2017 of 8.8% surpassed that of Hong Kong and Singapore, with 3.7% and 2.5% respectively. With a market capitalization of US$2.5 trillion as of 30 November 2018, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is the 8th largest exchange in the world.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nShenzhen's industry is described by its Municipal Bureau of Statistics to be upheld by its four-pillar industries: high-tech, finance, logistics, and culture. Shenzhen is primarily known for its high-tech industry, which has a value of 585.491 billion RMB (US$82.9 billion) in 2015, a 13% increase compared to last year. Out of the nominal GDP of 1,750.299 billion RMB in 2015, the high-tech industry comprises 33.4% of this amount. Shenzhen is home to a number of prominent tech firms, such as telecommunications and electronics corporation Huawei, internet giant and holding conglomerate Tencent, drone-maker DJI, and telecommunications company ZTE. Shenzhen annually holds the China International High-tech Achievements Fair, which showcases high-tech products and provides for dialogue and investment for high-tech. As a result, Shenzhen is dubbed by media outlets as \"China's Silicon Valley\" or the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware\" for the world.\nIn addition to its numerous high-tech companies, Shenzhen is also home to a number of large financial institutions, such as China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance and its subsidiary Ping An Bank. Since the city's establishment as a SEZ, a number of foreign banks had established offices in the city, including Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. In total, the financial industry accounts for 14.5% of the city's nominal GDP in 2015 (254.282 billion RMB), which was a 15.9% increase over the previous year. By the end of 2016, the total assets of the financial industry amounted to 12.7 trillion RMB (banking industry assets were 7.85 trillion RMB, security companies assets were 1.25 trillion RMB, and insurance industry assets were 3.6 trillion RMB), making Shenzhen's financial industry the third largest in China. In addition, Shenzhen is one of the world's top ten financial centers as of 2019, jumping five places to ninth place as determined by \"variety of areas of competitiveness, including business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial sector development and reputation.\"Addressing the logistics industry, courier SF Express and shipping company China International Marine Containers (CIMC) have their headquarters in Shenzhen.  The Port of Shenzhen, composed of Yantian International Container Terminals, Chiwan Container Terminals, Shekou Container Terminals, China Merchants Port and Shenzhen Haixing (Mawan port), handled a record number of containers with rising trade increased cargo shipments in 2005, ranking it as the world's third-busiest port. Together, the logistics industry accounts for around 10.1% (178.27 billion RMB) of the city's nominal GDP in 2015, which was an increase of 9.4%.Shenzhen had prioritized the cultural industry in according to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and planning the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. On 7 December 2008, UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network, and awarded the Shenzhen the title of \"United Nations Design Capital.\" Altogether, the cultural industry in turn contributes to 5.8% (102.116 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015.\nIn addition to the four pillar industries that was listed by the municipal government, Shenzhen also has a relatively notable real-estate industry. The real-estate industry altogether contributes to 9.2% (162.777 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015, which was an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Real estate developers such as Vanke and China Resources Land are headquartered within the city.\nAs a SEZ, Shenzhen has established several industrial zones to encourage economic activities. The Shekou Industrial Zone was approved and established back in 31 January 1979 by the Central Committee of the CPC to assist in the \"Hong Kong-based\" economy of Shenzhen. In 1996, the State Council approved and established the 11.5 km2 (4.4 sq mi) Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Development Zone, helping to develop Shenzhen's high-tech industry in areas such as electronics and information technology. In accordance to the National Plan in 2001, the Shenzhen Software Park, integrated within the High-tech Industrial Development Zone, was established for software production and assist in the development of the city's software industry. On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\" to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of \u2018top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its \"12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city's scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation. In 2015, the tourism industry's total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1% increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28% (35 billion RMB or US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2% from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51% increase from 2010.\n\nShenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings. Most of the tourist attractions are part of Overseas Chinese Town (OCT), a colloquial name for parks owned by OCT Enterprises and is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. These include the Window of the World, the Splendid China Folk Village, Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37), OCT East, and OCT Harbour. Other theme parks include Shekou Sea World (\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e16\u754c), Xiaomeisha Sea World, and the now-closed Minsk World. Shenzhen also has a number of popular public parks and beaches, such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, Wutongshan Park, Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa'). The city is also home to tall buildings such as the Ping An Finance Centre, KK100, and the Shun Hing Square (also known as Di Wang Tower).Shenzhen's tourism industry is recently expanding under the \"13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. Part of the plan includes organizing the tourist industry within five brands: theme parks, retail, natural recreational areas, sports, and international gatherings, as well as speeding up construction of future tourist attractions and turning Shenzhen into a Chinese hub for sports.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail is an important pillar of Shenzhen's tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen's tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion), retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen's FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.\n\nHuaqiang North (\u534e\u5f3a\u5317) is one of Shenzhen's notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world. Luohu Commercial City, a commercial complex located adjacent to Shenzhen Railway Station, is noted for having a variety of products that ranges from electronics and counterfeit goods to tailored suits and curtains. In addition to Huaqiang North and Luohu Commercial City, Shenzhen has numerous shopping malls and commercial areas, including COCO Park and its branches COCO City and Longgang COCO Park, Uniworld (\u58f9\u65b9\u5929\u5730), Uniwalk (\u58f9\u65b9\u573a), and Coastal City(\u6d77\u5cb8\u57ce).\"Smart retail\", which uses technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in production, circulation, and sales of consumer goods, has been growing popular within enterprises in Shenzhen. Businesses in Shenzhen are encouraged to use the Internet to develop the consumer market and new retail projects would be assisted with the use of technology. In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of \"smart retail\", with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a \"new retail\" hub.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nShenzhen is considered as a major innovation hub of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Over the years it has become one of the most important research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centers in the country.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nShenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China, with a population of 12,528,300 in the city as of 2017. With a total area of 1,992 km\u00b2, Shenzhen has a population density of 6,889 inhabitants per square kilometre. The encompassing metropolitan area of the city was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 23.3 million. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world's largest urban area according to the World Bank, and has a population of over 108.5 million according to the 2015 census.Before Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. However, since become a SEZ, Shenzhen has become a hub for migrants searching for work and opportunities within the city.\n\n\n=== Historic ===\nThere had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is Mandarin that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.\nShenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of the world's factory.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment. The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012\u201313, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a yoy increase of 500,000.\n\n\n=== Other statistics ===\nAt present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.The population structure has great diversity, ranging from intellectuals with a high level of education to migrant workers with poor education. It was reported in June 2007 that more than 20 percent of China's PhD graduates had worked in Shenzhen. Shenzhen was also elected as one of the top 10 cities in China for expatriates. Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.\nAccording to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen. Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is restricted.\nMainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an \"Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao\". Shenzhen residents can have a special 1 year multiple-journey endorsement (but maximum 1 visit per week starting from April 13, 2015) This type of exit endorsement is only issued to people who have hukou in certain regions.(See Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau.)\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n==== Koreans ====\n\nAs of 2007 there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. As of 2014 Donghai had about 200 Korean families.South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, Korean International School in Shenzhen. As of 2007 there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. As of 2014 spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nPrior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Rd. was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century. Younger generations of the Cantonese communities now speak the more standard version. Today, some aboriginals of the Cantonese and Hakka speaking communities disperse into urban settlements (e.g. apartments and villas), but most of them are still clustering in their traditional urban and suburban villages.The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city's linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism is on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers begin to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, local languages such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew are still commonly spoken among locals. Hokkien and Xiang are also sometimes observed.According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant churches, Catholic churches, and mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37% of Shenzhen's residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26% were Buddhists, 18% Taoists, 2% Christians and 2% Muslims; 15% were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn general, Shenzhen is a relatively safe city. However, in districts such as Bao'an and Longgang, the number of robberies, extortion, kidnapping, and fraud exceeds the national average. In the central part of the Luohu District, especially in the neighborhoods around the Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal, and the Luohu Commercial City Shopping Center, pickpocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. In addition, Luohu is a major center for trade in counterfeit goods and abundant in its nightclubs, bars, and karaoke salons, which not only attracts Shenzhen residents, but also residents from neighboring Hong Kong, which may attract criminal elements. The Nanshan District has a large concentration of foreigners, and is known for its abundance of prostitutes and beggars. Along with local gangs in Shenzhen, there is a notable presence of triads: notably Wo Shing Wo, Big Circle Gang, Sun Yee On, 14K, and Shui Fong. The level of corruption in the government is usually high, as seen in the arrest of the then-mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng, for accepting bribes in June 2009, as well as arrests and convictions of Li Yugo, the former head of the largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a customs officer of the city, for the same reasons.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nShenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as \"the world leader completing new skyscrapers,\" as it managed to complete 14 skyscrapers that are above 200 meters in 2018, four more than Dubai, and keeping this title for three years. In addition, the city is home to the most number of skyscrapers above 200 meters than any other cities in the world, with 82 completed as of July 2019. The city is ranked the third in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 223 of them completed as of July 2019, after Hong Kong and New York City. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 60 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2019. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599-meter, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. The second-tallest building is the Kingkey 100, rising 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and containing 100 floors of office and hotel spaces. Shenzhen is also the home to the Shun Hing Square (Diwang Building), the tallest in Asia (if the antenna is taken into account) when it was built in 1996. Guomao Building was furthermore the tallest building in China when it was completed in 1985.In addition to the Shenzhen's modern skyscrapers, Shenzhen also has a significant number of historical buildings. Chiwan Fort is located on a small seaside hill in the Nanshan District. Today, what is left only represents a fragment of the large fortress, as it was partially destroyed by the British during the Opium Wars. Tianhou Temple in the Nanshan District is dedicated to the goddess Mazu, a tutelary deity for fishermen and sailors. According to legend, the temple was founded in 1410 by Admiral Zheng He after his fleet survived a strong storm in the Pearl River Delta. The temple is repeatedly rebuilt and repaired. Part of the temple was converted to a museum, but the rest still continues to function as a religious building. The tomb of the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Bing, is located in the Nanshan district. The modern tomb dates back to the end of the 19th century, when a Hong Kong clan announced one of the imperial tombs after a long search, though this is disputed by historians. The tomb was reconstructed at the beginning of the 20th century, but later it fell into neglect until it was restored again in the 1980s. Dapin Fortress is located in the eastern part of the city, in the same area. It was built in 1394 to protect the coast from pirates and in 1571 suffered a long siege of Japanese corsairs. It later turned into a typical town during the Qing Dynasty, and during the First Opium War, the fortress garrison participated in the fight against the British. Walls and gates, narrow streets, temples, and the residence of the commandant in the fortress are still preserved today.  There is an old fortified Hakka village in the Longgang District, whose the architectural features of which are complemented by the Hakka Culture Museum.\n\nThe old town of Nantou (or Xin'an), located in the Nanshan District, has several historical sites dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. From the 4th century, there existed a significant city, but today most of the old buildings have been replaced by modern buildings. However, there are still a few historical buildings, such as fortress walls and gates dating back to the Ming period, the Guandi Temple (Guan Yu), some military and civilian buildings (for example, the residence of officials, the shop, and the opium house), and several streets.\n\n\n=== Parks and beaches ===\n\nShenzhen offers free admission to over of its twenty public city parks such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, and Wutongshan Park. The Xianhu Botanical Garden (\u4ed9\u6e56; 'Fairy Lake'), founded in 1982, is spread around the lake of the same name in the Luohu District on an area of 590 hectares. On one of the hills of the garden is Hunfa Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Shenzhen, which was built in 1985 on the site of an older shrine. Around the lake are a pagoda, tea houses, pavilions, the Museum of Paleontology, a garden of medicinal plants and an azalea garden. Wutongshan National Park (\u68a7\u6850\u5c71) is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station. Lianhuashan Park (\u83b2\u82b1\u5c71; Lotus Hill) is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of the mountain is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. The Shenzhen Garden and Flower Exposition Center, established in the Futian District in 2004 for the International Garden Exhibition, has many gardens of various styles, artificial ponds and waterfalls, a pagoda, pavilions, and statues. The Shenzhen Bay Park opened in 2011 which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay. The Shenzhen Safari Park in the Nanshan District combines a zoo and a large zoological center on a territory of 120 hectares. Xili Lake Resort (\u897f\u4e3d\u6e56), located in the Nanshan District, has a park with springs and waterfalls stretching around the lake, surrounded by a canopy, and a pagoda and a pavilion located on the top of Xili Mountain. Zhongshan Park (\u4e2d\u5c71), located in the Nanshan District, is the city's oldest park. It has several artificial lakes and ponds, an old city wall dating back to the 14th century, and many sculptures and monuments, including one of Sun Yat-sen. The Yangtai Mountain Forest Park is located around the 500-meter Yangtai Mountain (\u7f8a\u53f0\u5c71) in the Bao'an District. Nearby the mountain is Shiyan Lake (\u77f3\u5ca9\u6e56), which became a popular place of Xin'an County in the 16th century. It is famous for its several indoor and outdoor pools with hot thermal waters.Shenzhen has several beaches: Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa') in the Yantian District, and Jinshawan (\u91d1\u6c99\u6e7e; 'golden sands bay'), Nan'ao (\u5357\u6fb3; 'southern inlet'), and Xichong (\u897f\u51b2) in Dapeng Peninsula (in the vicinity of Dapeng New District, which is administered by the Longgang District).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBefore the 1980s, Shenzhen's education system was primarily based on primary and limited secondary schooling, with no residents admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. Shenzhen started implementing policies that will help develop a more high-quality education system, borrowing teachers from the best schools in the country with promises of higher pay and benefits. In addition, the city started building new schools and renovating the infrastructure of its existing schools to give teachers a more comfortable environment to teach.In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen's first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China's top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the innovative Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Institute of Technology. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.The 9-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. Secondary schools such as Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School, all of which have an on-line rate of over 90%, are dubbed as \"Shenzhen's four famous schools.\" As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools.According to Laurie Chen of the South China Morning Post, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou's count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen's by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nShenzhen is the second largest transportation hub in Guangdong and South China, trailing behind the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shenzhen has a developed extensive public transportation system, covering rapid transit, buses and taxis, most of which can be accessed by either using a Shenzhen Tong card or using QR codes generated by WeChat mini programs.\nRegarding air transport, Shenzhen is served by its own Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and the neighboring Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). Located 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the center of the city, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport serves as the main hub for passenger airlines Shenzhen Airlines and Donghai Airlines and a main hub for cargo airlines Jade Cargo International, SF Airlines, and UPS Airlines. Together, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport handled 49,348,950 passengers, 355,907 aircraft, and 1,218,502.2 cargo in 2018, making it the 5th busiest airport in China in terms of passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport in the country in terms of aircraft and cargo traffic. In addition to flying through Bao'an International Airport, ticketed passengers can also take ferries from the Shekou Cruise Centre and the Fuyong Ferry Terminal to the Skypier at Hong Kong International Airport. There are also coach bus services connecting Shenzhen with HKIA.\nThe Shenzhen Metro serves as the city's rapid transit system. The extension opened on 8 December 2019 put the network at 303.4 kilometres (188.5 miles) of trackage operating on 8 lines with 215 stations. By 2030 the network is planned to be 8 express and 24 non-express lines totalling 1142 kilometres of trackage. The average daily metro ridership in 2016 is 3.54 million passengers, which accounts for a third of public transportation users in the city. The metro also operates a tram system in the Longhua District.\n\nShenzhen is served by seven inter-city railway stations: Futian, Guangmingcheng, Pingshan, Shenzhen (also known as Luohu Railway Station) Shenzhen East, Shenzhen North, and Shenzhen West. High-speed rail (HSR) lines that go through the city are the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, and the Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen railway (forms part of the Hangzhou\u2013Fuzhou\u2013Shenzhen passenger railway). Non-HSR lines that go through Shenzhen are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway (forms part of the Kowloon\u2013Canton railway) and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.\nAs of August 2019, the city's bus system encompasses over 900 lines, with a total of over 16,000 electric vehicles, the largest of its kind in the world. The system is operated by multiple companies. As at January 2019 conversion of Shenzhen's taxi fleet to electric vehicles reached 99%. Electric taxis have a blue and white colour scheme. Petroleum fuelled taxis are coloured either green or red.Shenzhen serves as a fabric to China's expressway system. Expressways within the city include the Meiguan Expressway (part of the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway), the Jihe Expressway (part of the G15 Shenhai Expressway), the Yanba Expressway (part of the S30 Huishen Costal Expressway), the S28 Shuiguan Expressway, the Yanpai Expressway (part of the G25 Changshen Expressway and the S27 Renshen Expressway), and the S33 Nanguang Expressway. In response to being rejected from being a part of the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, Shenzhen is constructing a bridge across the Pearl River Delta to connect the city of Zhongshan.Private car ownership has been on the rise in Shenzhen, with the city having over 3.14 million cars in 2014. In response, the city imposed limits on car purchases to reduce traffic and pollution. The purchase of electric cars will be determined by a lottery, while traditional cars will be determined both a lottery and a bidding process. In addition, the city banned passenger vehicles with license plates issued in other places from four of Shenzhen's main districts during peak times on working days as of 29 December 2014.\n\nShenzhen is connected with Hong Kong (city and airport), Zhuhai and Macau through ferries that leave from and arrive at the Shekou Cruise Center. The Fuyong Passenger Terminal in the Bao'an District provide services to and from Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) and Macau (Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal). The Port of Shenzhen is the third busiest container port in the world, handling 27.7 million TEUs in 2018.Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has the largest number of entry and exit ports, the largest number of entry and exit personnel, and the largest traffic volume in China. Shenzhen is busiest in China when it comes to border crossings, with people entering and exiting the country through the city and Hong Kong reaching 239 million in 2015. In the same year, a total of 15.5 million vehicles crossed the border in Shenzhen, a 0.4% increase of last year.  Border crossing ports include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, and Luohu Port. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAs Shenzhen is located in Guangdong, the city historically has a Cantonese culture before its transition to a SEZ. Migrants coming to the city to find work and opportunities have turned Shenzhen into a cultural melting pot. Despite this, the municipal government and some of the residents living in Shenzhen, including those who are not from Guangdong, have invested in keeping and reflecting off the city's Cantonese heritage. Shenzhen has presented itself as a city of opportunity for young people in China. The competitive culture that the city promotes among the youth have resulted in the term \"Shenzhen speed,\" which describes a period of constant competition, quick changes, and high-efficiency.In 2003, the municipal government announced plans to turned Shenzhen into a cultural city by promoting design, animation, and library construction. The municipal government also intends to develop the city's cultural industry in accordance to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. Shenzhen's cultural industry specializes in being one of the largest handicraft manufacturers in China, and is also an industry center for oil painting in bases such as Dafen Village. Shenzhen also hosts the Shenzhen International Cultural Fair which specializes as an expo for the world's cultural industries, with the first expo being on November 2004. As a result of these developments, Shenzhen was awarded by UNESCO the title of \"United Nations Design Capital\" and was accepted entry into the Creative Cities Network on 7 December 2008.\n\nAs part of turning Shenzhen into a cultural city, the municipal government established the \"Library City\" (\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e4b\u57ce) concept in 2003. The plan would create a library network within the city through library construction, service improvement, and create a comfortable reading environment.  By the end of 2015, Shenzhen has 620 public libraries, including 3 city-level public libraries, 8 district-level public libraries, and 609 grassroots libraries.  Notable libraries include the Shenzhen Library and the Shenzhen Children's Library. Shenzhen also has bookstores, with the most notable being Shenzhen Book City in the Futian District. With an operating area of 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft), it claimed to be the largest bookstore of Asia at the time of its opening. Shenzhen has a number of museums and art galleries, such as the Shenzhen Museum, the Shenzhen Art Museum, the Shekou Maritime Museum, the Longgang Museum of Hakka Culture, the Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art, and the He Xiangning Art Museum. Shenzhen also has a few theaters, notably the Shenzhen Concert Hall, the Shenzhen Grand Theater, and the Shenzhen Poly Theater.\n\nAs with Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province, the main cuisine of Shenzhen is Cantonese. However, due to the recent growth of migrants to the city, Shenzhen also hosts a diverse array of cuisines, from Chinese cuisines such as Chaozhou cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hu Cuisine, and Xiang Cuisine, as well as foreign cuisines such as Korean, Japanese, French, and American. The Yantian District is known for its Chaozhou-based and Hakka-based seafood, with restaurants lined up along the coastline.  Some recreational areas in Shenzhen such as Xianhu Botanical Garden, Donghu Park, and Xiaomeisha, host barbecues where visitors bring their own food.  Street food such as Xinjiang lamb skewers, Northern Chinese pancakes, and black sesame soups, can be found in Xijie Street and the urban village of Baishizhou. Shenzhen also has its own tea culture. In regards to food chains, first McDonald's restaurant in mainland China opened for business in Shenzhen on 8 October 1990, providing the city American fast food. Shenzhen is home to the HeyTea chain of tea shops, which provides a variety of cheese and fruit teas and is popular among social media.Shenzhen has a prominent nightlife culture, with most of the activity centered in the entertainment complexes of COCO Park and Shekou, with the former being referred by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) as \"Shenzhen's answer to Lan Kwai Fong.\" There are many bars and clubs in the city, mostly unregulated, that stay open till the morning.  Tunnel raves, referred by the SCMP as \"a Shenzhen nightlife staple\", have earned a reputation in the world, though they are often cracked down by police.  Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui (\u6c99\u5634\u6751) in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShenzhen is the home to professional football team Shenzhen F.C., which participates in both China League One and the Chinese Super League. Another local football team, Shenzhen Ledman F.C., was once a part of China League Two until the club was disbanded in 2018. Shenzhen's top-tier basketball team, the Shenzhen Aviators, plays in the Southern Division of the Chinese Basketball Association. Shenzhen F.C. and the Shenzhen Aviators both are tenants of the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre.\nShenzhen Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that hosts many events. The stadium is located in Futian District and has a capacity of 32,500. It was built in June 1993, at a cost of 141 million RMB. The 26th Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen in August 2011. Shenzhen has constructed the sports venues for this first major sporting event in the city.Shenzhen Dayun Arena is a multipurpose arena.  It was completed in 2011 for the 2011 Summer Universiade.  It is used for the basketball, ice hockey and gymnastics events.  The arena is the home of the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\nShenzhen is also a popular destination for skateboarders from all over the world, due to the architecture of the city and its lax skate laws.The Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre was one of the venues at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 2019 to 2028 Shenzhen is hosting the WTA Finals, a major annual professional tennis tournament for the world's most top-ranked female players.\n\n\n== Relationship with Hong Kong ==\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below. Except where noted the statistics are taken from sections of the Hong Kong Government website.As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 teus/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary, while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.\n\nTrade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333 billion of imports of which US$298 billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card (Home Return Permit) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of Zhongshan on the Western side: the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge.\n\n\n==== Qianhai ====\n\nQianhai, which means foresea in Chinese language, formally known as the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone, is \"a useful exploration for China to create a new opening up layout with a more open economic system.\" A 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi) area located in western Shenzhen, Qianhai lies at the heart of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to Shenzhen international airport. Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta. With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from HSBC, \"This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nShenzhen has an advanced public media network, boasting one radio station, two TV stations, three broadcasting and TV centers, 19 cable broadcasting and TV sub-stations. In Shenzhen, there are 14 newspapers, one comprehensive publishing house, three video-audio products publishing houses, 88 bureaus of inland and Hong Kong media organizations, 40 periodicals, and about 200 kinds of in-house publications of which the majority belong to enterprises. The most prominent media companies in Shenzhen are the Shenzhen Media Group, the Shenzhen Press Group, China Entertainment Television (CETV), and Phoenix Television branch iFeng.Shenzhen News (\u6df1\u5733\u665a\u62a5, sznews.com) is a Chinese-language newspaper owned by the Shenzhen Press Group that serves as Shenzhen's main online new source. Shenzhen Daily is an English-language news outlet for Shenzhen. It also covers local, national and international news. That's Shenzhen is the Shenzhen edition of That's PRD, an English-language media company with an online, print and social footprint. That's Shenzhen covers news, arts, lifestyle and events in the city. ShekouDaily.com is an online media outlet providing news and resources that focus on the Shekou sub-district in Nanshan District of Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nShenzhen has been very active in cultivating sister city relationships. In October 1989, Shenzhen Mayor Li Hao and a delegation travelled to Houston to attend the signing ceremony establishing a sister city relationship between Houston and Shenzhen. Houston became the first sister city of Shenzhen. Up to 2015, Shenzhen has established sister city relationship with 25 cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Other twinnings ===\nThe Shenzhen Port is twinned and has collaboration agreements with:\n\n The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, June 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Shenzhen-related articles\nAdministrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\nEconomy of China\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPearl River (China)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBach, Jonathan (August 2010). \"\"THEY COME IN PEASANTS AND LEAVE CITIZENS\": Urban Villages and the Making of Shenzhen, China\".

It is the proposed development site for the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park (simplified Chinese: \u6e2f\u6df1\u521b\u65b0\u53ca\u79d1\u6280\u56ed; traditional Chinese: \u6e2f\u6df1\u5275\u65b0\u53ca\u79d1\u6280\u5712; pinyin: G\u01ceng-Sh\u0113n Chu\u00e0ngx\u012bn J\u00ed K\u0113j\u00ec Yu\u00e1n).\n\n\n== Political status ==\nWith a land area of only 0.97 km2, the Lok Ma Chau Loop is currently the only unincorporated area in Hong Kong. Because every piece of land in Mainland China belongs to a county-level (third level) administrative division, this makes the Lok Ma Chau Loop the only unincorporated area under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China.\nEddie Chu, a Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, lodged an inquiry to various local authorities on 29 March 2019, urging them to take the necessary steps to incorporate the Lok Ma Chau Loop into one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong (most likely to be a part of North District or Yuen Long District).\n\n\n== Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park ==\nThe Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park is a proposed new hi-tech development at the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China. It is located in Hong Kong's New Territories near the area of Lok Ma Chau, adjacent to the Sham Chun River.\nThe development of the technology park was announced on 3 January 2017 during a joint ceremony by the governments of Hong Kong and Shenzhen. When completed, it will be the largest technology park in Hong Kong with a land area of 87 hectares and is expected to boost the city's global position in technology and provide an incubator for technology start-ups.\n\n\n== Details of the development ==\nUntil the late 1990s, the Lok Ma Chau Loop was a part of Mainland China. When some engineering work was done to straighten the winding Sham Chun River, the natural border moved north and effectively left the landmass of the loop only accessible from Hong Kong. Dispute of ownership of the land continued until recent years. With the agreement of the technology park, the land dispute has been settled.Once developed, the technology park is expected to provide 1.2 million square metres of additional office spaces to be used by Hong Kong and Shenzhen companies.The technology park is expected to be managed by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Corporation.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\n\n==== Environmental ====\nThe proposed park is located in a current green land area, a buffer zone between the urban agglomerations of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Environmental groups claim the park is located in an important flightpath for migratory birds. The wetlands form an ecosystem that continues west along Sham Chun River and the development may thus affect Deep Bay. The Hong Kong wetland park and the Mai Po Marshes are also along this route. The groups estimate the loss of 4,000 trees, 11 hectares of reed marsh and 9 hectares of ponds.\nIn addition, it is thought that the current marsh land site contains significant amounts of contaminated mud which may pose an environmental risk and a challenge to decontaminate.\n\n\n==== Rationale ====\nHong Kong has two existing high profile business and technology parks, Cyberport on Hong Kong Island and Science Park, also in the New Territories. Both were conceived in the wake of the 1997 Asia financial crisis in order to boost technology investments, but their uptake has been slow and is only just starting to come to fruition. Especially Cyberport has been marred with image problems, starting from its delayed development to lacking in commercial success.Lok Ma Chau loop has been claimed to be at risk of repeating some of the Cyberport experience by being yet another government run development on the green field with poor transport links while there is ample existing office space in and around Hong Kong which may be suitable for start-ups in a more economical and more relevant way in a world of virtual collaboration. On the other hand, some local business groups welcome the technology park, but are mindful that lessons are learned from previous developments and that there should be all effort for a speedy development.Questions have been raised whether the true ambition of the government is to support the technology industry, or to obtain land for profitable real estate development.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMemorandum of Understanding\nPlanning and Engineering Study Lok Ma Chau Loop\nDeveloper project page",

        "wiki": "BGI, currently known as the BGI Group, formerly known as the Beijing Genomics Institute, is a Chinese genome sequencing company, headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.It was formed in 1999 to participate in the Human Genome Project as a genetics research center. It also sequences genomes of other animals, plants and microorganisms.BGI Group announced at the AGBT conference in February 2020 that it will make genome sequencing cheaper, breaking the $100 barrier for the first time. The Shenzhen company says the low cost will be possible with an \"extreme\" DNA sequencing system it plans to offer that is capable of decoding the genomes of 100,000 people a year.\nThe company has morphed from a research institute that decoded the DNA of pandas and rice plants into a company active in animal cloning, health testing, and contract research.\n\n\n== History ==\nWang Jian, Yu Jun, Yang Huanming and Liu Siqi created BGI in September 1999, in Beijing, China as a non-governmental independent research institute in order to participate in the Human Genome Project as China's representative. After the project was completed, funding dried up, after which BGI moved to Hangzhou in exchange for funding from the Hangzhou Municipal Government. In 2002, BGI sequenced the rice genome, which was a cover story in the journal Science. In 2003 BGI decoded the SARS virus genome and created a kit for detection of the virus. In 2003, BGI Hangzhou and the Zhejiang University founded a new research institute, the James D. Watson Institute of Genome Sciences, Zhejiang University. The Watson Institute was intended to become a major center for research and education in East Asia modeled after the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in the US.\nIn 2007 BGI's headquarters relocated to Shenzhen as \"the first citizen-managed, non-profit research institution in China\". Yu Jun left BGI at this time purportedly selling his stake to the other 3 founders for a nominal sum. In 2008, BGI-Shenzhen was officially recognized as a non-profit organization by the Shenzhen government. In 2008, BGI published the first human genome of an Asian individual.In 2010 BGI Shenzhen was certified as meeting the requirements of ISO9001:2008 standard for the design and provision of high-throughput sequencing services, The same year BGI bought 128 Illumina HiSeq 2000 gene-sequencing machines, which was backed by US$1.5 billion in \"collaborative funds\" over the next 10 years from the China Development Bank. By the end of the year, they reportedly had a budget of $30 million. In 2010, BGI Americas was established with its main office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, and BGI Europe was established in Copenhagen, Denmark. By 2018, they were expanded with offices and laboratories in Seattle and San Jose in USA, and London in the UK, as well were founded BGI Asia Pacific with offices in Hong Kong, Kobe (Japan), Bangkok (Thailand), Laos, Singapore, Brisbane (Australia) and many others.In 2011 BGI reported it employed 4,000 scientists and technicians, and had a $192 million in revenue. BGI did the genome sequencing for the deadly 2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in three days and released it under an open license. Since 2012, it has started to commercialize its services, having investments from China Life Insurance Company, Citic's Goldstone Investment, Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital, and SoftBank China Capital. That year they also launched their own scientific journal, GigaScience, partnering with BioMed Central to publish data-heavy life science papers. In 2013 BGI reported it had relationships with 17 out of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, and advertised that it provided commercial science, health, agricultural, and informatics services to global pharmaceutical companies. That year it bought Complete Genomics of Mountain View, California, a major supplier of DNA sequencing technology, for US$118 million. In the same year, the BGI was roughly valued at $820 million.In 2015, they signed a collaboration with the Zhongshan Hospital' Center for Clinical Precision Medicine in Shanghai, opened in May 2015 with a budget of \u00a5100 million. They are reportedly being involved as a sequencing institution in China's US$9.2-billion research project for medical care which will last for 15 years. In May 2017, was announced formation of West Coast Innovation Center, co-located in Seattle and San Jose, on the first location planned to work on precision medicine and feature collaborations with University of Washington, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Washington State University, while on the second's already existing laboratory with 100 employees to develop the next-generation sequencing technologies. In May 2018, was reached an agreement with Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto), Canada, for first installation of BGISEQ platforms in North America.The BGI Group subsidiary, BGI Genomics, had made initial public offering in July 2017 at Shenzhen Stock Exchange, raising \u00a5547 million ($80.7 million), with company's first-day valuation set at over $1.15 billion. In 2018, the BGI was reportedly 85.3% owned by Wang Jian, and the group owns 42.4% of its main unit BGI Genomics. The reported market value for BGI Genomics in July 2018 was around $5 billion, as is of another subsidiary, MGI Tech, specialized in developing and manufacturing technology, which IPO of a stake of about 20% for $1 billion is scheduled for 2019 in Hong Kong. In 2019, competitor Illumina, Inc. filed multiple patent infringement lawsuits against BGI.In 2019, it was reported that a BGI subsidiary, Forensic Genomics International, had created a WeChat-enabled database of genetic profiles of people across the country. In July 2020, it was reported that BGI returned a Paycheck Protection Program loan following media scrutiny. The same month, the Bureau of Industry and Security placed two BGI subsidiaries on its \"Entity List\" for assisting in alleged human rights abuses due to its genetic analysis work in Xinjiang.\n\n\n== Key achievements ==\nFirst to de novo sequence and assemble mammalian and human genomes with short-read sequencing (so-called \"next generation sequencing\")\nSequenced the first ancient human's genome\nSequenced the first diploid genome of an Asian individual, as part of the Yan Huang project\nInitiated building a sequence map of the human pan-genome, estimated to contain 19-40 million bases not in the human reference genome\nThe BGI's first project was contributing 1% of the Human Genome Project\u2019s reference genome and was the only institute in the developing world to contribute\nContributed 10% of sequence information for the International HapMap Project\nProduced proof-of-principle study for sequencing the microbiome of the human digestive system, an estimated 150 times larger than the human genome\nKey sequencing center in the 1000 Genomes Project\nFirst Chinese institution to sequence the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, just hours after the first sequencing of the virus by Canadians\nKey player in the open source data release and analysis of the 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak\nSequenced 40 domesticated and wild silkworms, identifying 354 genes likely important in domestication.\nSequenced the first giant panda genome, equal in size to the human genome, in less than 8 months. Sequencing revealed that the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, has a frameshift mutation in a gene involved in sensing savory flavors, T1R1. The mutation might be the genetic reason why the panda prefers bamboo over meat. However, the panda also lacks genes expected for bamboo digestion, so its microbiome might play a key role in metabolizing its main source of food.\nKey player in the Sino-British Chicken Genome Project\nAs of 2010, plant genomes sequenced include rice, cucumber, soybean, and Sorghum. Animal genomes sequenced include silkworm, honey bee, water flea, lizard, and giant panda. An additional 40 animal and plant species and over 1000 bacteria had also been sequenced.\nNature in 2010 ranked BGI Shenzhen as the 4th among the top 10 institutions in China with all the others being universities and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The ranking was based on articles in Nature research journals. By 2016, it topped the corporate institutions list in China as well was 13th corporate institution on global scale. In 2017, among the most productive corporate\u2013academic collaborations between 2012 and 2016, the BGI and University of Copenhagen partnership was ranked as 4th.\nBetween 2001 and 2013, the BGI featured in around 250 papers published in first-class academic journals.\nIn 2014, the BGI was reported to be producing 500 cloned pigs a year to test new medicines, and roughly 25% of world's genomic data.\nIn January 2018, BGI Genomics CEO, Yin Ye, stated they sequenced over 10,000 WGS samples, with additional 20,000 being sequenced by their BGISEQ-500 platform, about 70% of animals and plants until now were sequenced by the company and their partners, as well worked on \"over 10 million clinical samples, including running 2.8 million noninvasive prenatal tests, 2.6 million human papillomavirus tests, 1.53 million hearing impairment tests, just over half a million newborn screening tests, and around 25,000 rare disease tests\".\n\n\n== Current research projects ==\n\n\n=== Human genetics ===\n\n\n==== Human Genome Project ====\n\nAn international project launched in 1990 and declared complete in 2003. They joined in 1999 and provided 1% of the workload.\n\n\n==== International HapMap Project ====\n\nAn international project launched in 2002 and declared complete in 2009. They provided 10% of the workload.\n\n\n==== Yan Huang Project ====\nStarted in 2007 and named after two Emperors believed to have founded China's dominant ethnic group, BGI planned in this project, to sequence at least 100 Chinese individuals to produce a high-resolution map of Chinese genetic polymorphisms. The first genome data was published in October 2007. An anonymous Chinese billionaire donated $10 million RMB (about US$1.4 million) to the project and his genome was sequenced at the beginning of the project.\n\n\n==== 1000 Genomes Project ====\n\nAn international project launched in 2008 and declared complete in 2015.\n\n\n==== International Cancer Genome Project ====\n\nAn international project launched in 2008.\n\n\n==== 1000 Rare Disease Project ====\nAn international projected jointly initiated with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2011. With it were discovered genes and mutations associated with rare diseases, which was reported in more than 20 scientific publications. They also \"co-developed a clinical whole exome diagnostic test offered through CHOP pathology since 2012\". They again collaborated in 2017 when CHOP's Children's Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium was joined by BGI's China National GeneBank.\n\n\n==== Intelligence Project ====\nA Chinese project focused on the research of the genetic basis of intelligence launched in August 2012. American physicist Stephen Hsu joined as a scientific adviser and was one of the project's leaders. It was done on 2,200 samples mostly from the United States, out of which 1,600 were of individuals who participated in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth and reportedly have IQs over 160, collected by American psychologist and geneticist Robert Plomin.\n\n\n=== Animals and plants ===\n\n\n==== 1000 Plant Genome Project ====\n\nAn international project launched in 2008 and declared complete in 2015. In 2010, BGI has announced it will contribute US$100 million to large-scale sequencing projects of plants and animals.\n\n\n==== Three Extreme-Environment Animal Genomes Project ====\nIn 2009 BGI-Shenzhen announced the launch of three genome projects that focus on animals living in extreme environments. The three selected genomes are those of two polar animals: the polar bear and emperor penguin, and one altiplano animal: the Tibetan antelope.\n\n\n==== International Big Cats Genome Project ====\nIn 2010, BGI, Beijing University, Heilongjiang Manchurian tiger forestry zoo, Kunming Institute of Zoology, San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research in California, and others announced they would sequence the Amur tiger, South China tiger, Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, African lion, clouded leopard, snow leopard, and other felines. BGI would also sequence the genomes and epigenoms of a liger and tigon. Since the two reciprocal hybrids have different phenotypes, despite being genetically identical, it was expected that the epigenome might reveal the basis of such differences. The project aim was to significantly advance conservation research and was auspiciously announced for the Chinese year of the Tiger. Results were reported in 2013 for the genomes of the Anur tiger, the white Bengal tiger, African lion, white African lion and snow leopard.\n\n\n==== Symbiont Genome Project ====\nA jointly funded project announced on 19 March 2010, BGI announced it would collaborate with Sidney K. Pierce of University of South Florida and Charles Delwiche of the University of Maryland at College Park to sequence the genomes of the sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, and its algal food Vaucheria litorea. The sea slug uses genes from the algae to synthesize chlorophyll, the first interspecies of gene transfer discovered. Sequencing their genomes could elucidate the mechanism of that transfer. This work was eventually completed presenting the genome assembly with a total length of 557\u2009Mb.\n\n\n==== Earth BioGenome Project ====\n\nAn international project initiated with the Smithsonian Institution and other partners in 2018, to sequence DNA of the 1.5 million known eukaryotic species on the planet.\n\n\n=== Microorganisms ===\n\n\n==== Ten Thousand Microbial Genomes Project ====\nThe project was started on 1 August 2009, with the mission to sequence 10,000 microbes within 3 years. It includes sequencing industrial, agricultural, medical microorganism and many others. It is done in collaboration with many institutes, universities and enterprises, including Biotechnology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology of Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n== Bioinformatics technology ==\nIn 2010, the institute 500-node supercomputer processed 10 terabytes of raw sequencing data every 24 hours from its current 30 or so Genome Analyzers from Illumina. The annual budget for the computer center was US$9 million. In the same year, BGI's computational biologists developed the first successful algorithm, based on graph theory, for aligning billions of 25 to 75-base pair strings produced by next-generation sequencers, specifically Illumina's Genome Analyzer, during de novo sequencing. The algorithm, called SOAPdenovo, can assemble a genome in two days and has been used to assemble an array of plant and animal genomes.SOAPdenovo is part of \"Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package\" (SOAP), a suite of tools developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis. Built for the Illumina sequencers' short reads, SOAPdenovo has been used to assemble multiple human genomes (identifying an eight kilobase insertion not detected by mapping to the human reference genome) and animals, like the giant panda.Up until 2015, BGI had released BGISEQ-100, based on Thermo Fisher Scientific's Ion Torrent device, and BGISEQ-1000, based on similar technology by Complete Genomics, for both of which received an approval from the CFDA for a NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) prenatal test. In October 2015, BGI launched BGISEQ-500, a larger desktop sequencing system, which received an approved registration as a medical device a year later by the CFDA. It reportedly received more than 500 orders for the system and run over 112,000 tests until late 2016. The China National GeneBank, opened by BGI and Chinese Government in September 2016, has 150 instruments of the system. The BGISEQ-500 was developed as a sequencing platform capable of competing with Illumina's platforms with its quality and reduced price. In November 2016, BGI launched BGISEQ-50, a miniature version of desktop sequencer. In 2017, BGI began offering WGS for $600. In October 2017, MGI Tech, a subsidiary of BGI, launched two new sequencers MGISEQ-2000 and MGISEQ-200 (later renamed as DNBSEQ-G400 and DNBSEQ-G50), while a year later DNBSEQ-T7.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese National Human Genome Center\nChina National GeneBank\nWellcome Sanger Institute\nBroad Institute\nIllumina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBGI Website\nBGI Genomics Website\nMGI Tech Co., Ltd.

Many of the animals including pigs right at the entrance,",

          "The zoo is one of my favorites as it has many varieties of animals, birds, fishes, etc., a showground and an amusement park. It is a large zoo and it takes a good 2-3 hours to walk around leisurely. One could feed the tigers and lions from inside a caged car, to get a close",
          "The price we paid for admission was $87HKD instead of 240RMB. Kids under 120cm are free. There are several online travel agencies that offer discounted vouchers, to be exchanged at the customer service booth there for the actual tickets and don\u2019t forget to bring your foreign ID",

          "This was my 2nd time here and it was enjoyable enough. As with any zoo in Asia some of the animals are in good conditions some are not. The penguins looked pretty poorly looked after for example and the monkeys too. But the tigers and lions looked ok. Cost is 240 RMB.",
          "We arrived @ 10am amongst many people all in a rush to get into the park. We are Australian, everything is in Chinese, but you can work your way through it all. First, purchase your ticket - 240 RMB per adult, then enter through the turnstiles. Once inside, we headed in the",

          "This is a day outing if you are a family with young children. The park is very organised and hosts a wide range of animals. The Lion Safari is worth the money if you want to get up close and personal with the beasts and feed them. My two year old loved it. The only downside is",
          "It's nothing compare to Thailand and Africa, is ok for China and Hong Kong residents. Buy cheap tickets from hokou or Groupon. We went by taxi from border. It takes around half hour to reach, better to take metro if you have time. Most animals are not kept in good condition.",
          "While not a comprehensive zoo, there is a large group of big cats and bears. Siberian and Chinese tigers, lions, white tigers, tigons and ligers. There's a nice horse show with daring stunts. And a water show with seals, dolphins and swimmers. Lunch for two costs about 100 RMB.",

          "I don't share the bad comments on this zoo. What is the main thing you're looking for in a zoo? Animals? in good shape, in great diversity and in great number right? Well that's exactly what you'll find in this zoo! Yes the equipment and decoration on some parts might seem a bit",
          "This zoo is great if you want to br hands on and feed different animals including tigers. It is not up to the high standard of an international zoo and needs some improvements. We feed lions, tigers and elephants. Worth it",
          "The zoo brought back memories from the 70s! The place was dated and some bits deserted. However, I do enjoyed the shows and feeding the tigers. We paid RMB20 per person to get access on the buses that take tourists around, but they were not in sight frequently. So we ended",
          "I stayed in Luohu and the journey by car was about 45 min. Kinda long ride. Please note of the Peak hours. The zoo is big with satisfied number of animals who have their own good space and enclosure. There are show times which are highlights of the visit including animal circus.",

        "wiki": "Mai Po Marshes (Chinese: \u7c73\u57d4\u6fd5\u5730; Hong Kong Hakka: Mi3bu4 Sip5ti4) is a nature reserve located in San Tin near Yuen Long in Hong Kong.  It is part of Deep Bay, an internationally significant wetland that is actually a shallow estuary, at the mouths of Sham Chun River, Shan Pui River (Yuen Long Creek) and Tin Shui Wai Nullah. Inner Deep Bay is listed as a Ramsar site under Ramsar Convention in 1995, and supports globally important numbers of wetland birds, which chiefly arrive in winter and during spring and autumn migrations. The education center and natural conservation area is 380 acres (1.5 km2) wide and its surrounding wetland has an area of 1500 acres (6 km2). It provides a conservation area for mammals, reptiles, insects, and over 350 species of birds.\nThe reserve is managed by the World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong since 1983 and WWF runs professionally guided visits for the public and schools to the reserve ; the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has responsibilities for the Ramsar site as a whole. Deep Bay faces threats, including pollution, and rising mudflat levels that perhaps arise from intense urbanization, especially (in recent years) on the north, Shenzhen side of the bay.\nIn recent years, it housed over 55,000 migrating birds, including Saunders's gull (Chroicocephalus saundersi) and a quarter of the world's black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor) population. It also has inter-tidal mangroves along with 24 traditionally operated shrimp ponds (called Gei Wai locally) to provide food for the birds. Mai Po Marshes receives some 32,000 visitors annually. This April 2020 a pair of spoonbill sandpiper have been spotted at the reserve. \nWhile the area was taken out of the Frontier Closed Area on 15 February 2012, Mai Po Nature Reserve remains a restricted area under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Chapter 170) in order to minimize disturbance to wildlife. \nVisitors need a 'Mai Po Marshes Entry Permit' to enter the Reserve. \nBy joining a WWF professionally guided activity you can book online wwf.org.hk/en and be part of a small group ecovisit and WWF will take care of permits for you.  ( From 16 March - small eco groups of 4 will ensure community health precautions to maintain safe , healthy access on your visit with WWF to the Reserve )   \nAs an individual you can apply for a permit by writing to the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department of Hong Kong Government. These Individual Permits normally take about four weeks to be processed.\nThe marshes are also have rich insect biodiversity, being the place the endemic Mai Po bent winged firefly (Pteroptyx maipo Ballantyne) was discovered. Not only was  the species new to science, but it was also the first time for the genus Pteroptyx has been recorded in China. To understand the seasonal population changes, distribution and habitat requirements of the species, WWF Hong Kong have been carrying out firefly surveys of the nature reserve. The surveys have also incorporated Citizen Science participation, and using this approach to further monitor the biodiversity, WWF have incorporated iNaturalist and the City Nature Challenge into activities at their Mai Po centre.\n\n\n== Avian flu outbreak ==\nIn February 2008, the Hong Kong government closed Mai Po for 21 days following the discovery of a great egret infected with H5N1, also known as avian flu.  The closing marked the fourth in as many years and was consistent with the government's policy of closing Mai Po whenever an infection is discovered within a 3 kilometer radius of the premises.  The World Wide Fund for Nature criticized the government, however, for what it called a discrepancy between the standards for closing Mai Po and the comparably less strict standards applied in urban areas.  The World Wide Fund for Nature wanted compensation of 1 million Hong Kong dollars.

          "I\u2019m negative by nature, but I have nothing but pleasant feelings about Splendid China. Clean, nice, friendly. An an amazing entertainment value. Especially so if you\u2019re as ancient as I am. One word : Half_Price",
          "I visited this cultural village in 2006. It was amazing then and highlighted the ethnic \"minorities\" in China. A worthwhile visit if you are in Shenzen. An interesting fact is that the Govt of China are encouraging \"minority\" ethnicities to increase their populations.",
          "I am not quite impress with this place. The place is also quite old. The ticket is quite expensive for a visit.",
          "Good value . Excellent presentation. The centre has exhibits from the many different cultures from China. There is two parts to Splendid China. One is the Cultural Village theother is miniature world . Both are included in the one price. If you are over 70 then it is free.",
          "This place includes a representation of the various cultures and minorities in China. It has villages, shows, cultural activities, and restaurants. Highly recommended!!",
          "You might spend a whole day here because so many things you can see. and it is deserved. I with my tour guide come here to relax and see the Chinese cultures when I am free. With an English tour guide is much easy to understand the cultures because you can ask him to explain.",
          "First: they want a passport to buy tickets. We used driver license and they agreed. It not cheap and cash only. It\u2019s like a mini-China, well taken care of but not that impressive. Going around the city is better.",
          "China folk culture village is nice, there are a lot of things to see and in the evening they have cool shows. It\u2019s fun for 1 time, just a little bit overpriced.",

          "We went there in late August, barely any crowd because of the brutal temperature. The tickets are not cheap in my opinion, it cost me a fortune with few kids. But it\u2019s a good park to know lots about the country and peak into many of its signature architecture and cultures. We",

          "Please shows you not only the most popular and interesting places in China. It is more than that. The live shows are at the level of the best theaters and circuses. You can use transportation and see everything. On very warm days, this is a very good solution. We'll be back",
          "You need a full day and evening to walk around and enjoy this beautiful and interesting park of miniatures. Not everything is tiny least of all the free evening show. I wasn't expecting much for free but decided to wait and collect the free tickets on offer after a lovely day",

          "It is a great place to visit. Frankly speaking, I expected sth a bit different, but it was still great to see all these miniatures from all over China, and not only. Although I liked the second part of the oart better, the one with the huts and tribes. It is open space, so",
          "I was there for a business trip, and took the weekend with colleagues to discover more about China. It is a miniature version of all the great places in China, combined with shows and authentic rebuild buildings from different regions. A great way to spend your free time! I do",

          "200 rmb per person. I think kids and seniors get a discount. The park is well maintained but you will for sure see some tacky things like mountains made of plastic, but hey, you're in China. The park takes you through the many different cultures in China and shows you how they",
          "The china folk culture village is combined with Splendid china where the miniatures of all Chinese monuments are showcased, ticket priced at 200 RMB per person. Easily accessible via the OCT subway station on line 1. We visited this place on the first day of chinese new year.",

          "It' like a big beautiful garden around a lake, one side is dedicated to the minor ethnic people living in china the other side is a place with the most important China's sites in miniature. I would evaluates as 5 star for the Folk Cultural village and maybe 3-4 for the",

The park is huge, but there\u2019s one little area, tucked away near a weird hippo statue, where there are some truly horrible animal enclosures. Are there any standards you have to pass to be able to keep monkeys? Because this",
          "As the world modernized, travelers don't want to see the same concrete jungle from different places. We would like to explore nature, arts, culture and heritage. The Splendid China and Folk Cultural Village is one best place in Shenzhen, China. Not only that you would be able to",
          "The miniatures are fun to watch if you, like us, only have a five day visa and no time to explore entire China. The other part of the park, the folk villages, felt wierd to us. It was beautiful to watch but at the same time it felt so false to see the park, for instance,",
          "A must-see while in Shenzhen. It provides you with an overview of the different regions and cultures within China. The recreations are beautiful. I only saw the village at night, but would definitely recommend you go during the day and the night as some sights can't be viewed",
          "Interesting park to learn and see the China minority tribes and buildings. The miniature China scale buildings gives you insight of the many historic sites around China. Keep an eye on the many shows and performance thru out day mainly the 3pm Tibet with horses, 5pm dancings",
          "There are many mini-cultural villages in the park with various performances throughout the day. A train goes around the park quite often so getting the train pass is pretty worth it. It is nice to view the various 'traditional' buildings but it is definitely commercialised and",
          "Went on a monday morning when it was relatively quiet. The shuttle cost an additional 30rmb per pax to bring us one round around the vast park. There were other options of driving your own e-vehicle or a donkey cart to get around. The attractions were miniature versions of",
          "Like the world attraction next door, this is a culture park showing chinese culture in full scale and with models. Some of the models need a bit of TLC but the place is much better maintained than its next door neighbor. Allow 2+ hours to walk through and make the time for the",
          "This theme park offers some shows to watch. I watched the night show. It was a theatrical performance full of dances and acrobatics. The place was semi outdoor and amphitheater style, so your view would be blocked if someone stand up or walk in front of you. It was kind of",
          "Very short business trip and a friend suggested we visit this place. Being able to see some of the wonders of China in miniatures was amazing, but the cultural shows, donkey carts and actors embedded were such nice touches. Strongly suggest get a cart because it gets hot and",

          "200 RMB is not cheap. But you get sth in return. Specially the Splendid China part which shows 80+ models of famous buildings and landmarks from all over China. Almost all of them done with highest attention to detail and craftsmanship. Like in more traditional Chinese gardens",
          "We ventured out to China Folk Cultural Village on a hot Sunday. Despite the heat, we were excited about the attraction based on the reviews. The day started off bad and unfortunately for us, only got worse The park is LARGE. Many reviewers recommend the additional",
          "Beautiful grounds and magical places. Really worth exploring. You will need a few hours to cover the entire place but well worth it.",
          "Some friends took me there in the evening. The ticket is cheaper after 19:00. There were many reproductions of Chinese temples, houses, pagodas... and places to shop and eat. We watched a dancing show that represented the history of China. The place was packed and the show",
          "This park serves as an excellent introduction to the diverse cultures and ethnic groups making up China. There are two villages in this 30 Hectare/75 acre Park-- one highlighting the 100 leading scenic wonders (miniature versions) and the other cultural, historical, art &",
          "The China Folk Culture Village is very very nice park in Shenzhen. This worthwhile attraction is part of Overseas Chinese Village.",
          "This village was brilliantly done. An Oasis. Lots of walking so be prepared. But every single step was worth it. You can see all of China in one place but take at least two days to see it all properly.",

          "The area is vast and clean. There are plenty of attractions and buildings. The actors play their part well. They even got a zip line and it's free (but you can't be fat because weight limit is small). However it's all fake. It's a Disneyland of sorts that it supposed to give",
          "My wife and I had the chance to visit this place while we were in Shenzhen for a few hours and it was worth a visit. Mind you that we do not speak Mandarin nor can we read Chinese characters at all, but that still doesn't take away from the experience. We had a guide map that",
          "My daughter loved it but was more excited about window of tge world. Then again maybe it was because we got here after WOTW and were already exhausted. Get a golf cart that way if it rains you have a roof.",
          "Nice place to visit with all the family members or friends or any one who like to see the old china art and culture",
          "This place is Huge and you really need around 4-5 hours to explore this even more. See every single place. Must watch the Theatre Show. Walk along the Long river side and see the old villages miniatures along the River/Canal side. Walk till the end. When you enter you find the",
          "This was our second visit and frankly this one was better. We hired one of the electric cars (or you can go in a group in a larger driven vehicle) to see this rather large place. Pick an Asian country and it is represented. Bring your passport and the entry is free for aged",
          "I visited this cultural village and was so impressed! Chinese are determined to ensure they presence their culture! You will need half a day to explore this village! You lear a lot about the culture and the food! I was excited to see they\u2019re have a lovely lake and zip line !",
          "I go to this place 2 times and enjoy the shows here. Actually in the past they have 3 shows. Horse show (now is closed already) The rest is indoor show and outdoor show (action) Only 1 big restaurant inside the village.",
          "What impressed us was the information centre had someone who not only spoke English but could also give helpful tips about the experience. You are able to hirer an English speaking guide and motorised car which can speed up the day as it is a huge area to explore. Be aware that",
          "This place is huge and beautiful. Put on your comfy shoes if you want to walk to the end of the park. I highly recommend you walk to the end of the park as every corner have its own miniature of China folk culture. Its Instagram worthy scenery! The culture show was fantastic",
          "The ticket is rather expensive (RMB200) but free for children below 122cm and half price for children below 150cm. The leaflet is available in chinese and english. Miniature of china shows the scene of china in very large garden. But it doesn't show something spectacular here.",
          "Well,when my visit this beautiful place ended,because everything closed about 21:00, I can honestly said, that I have been sad.This place is realy amazing.I spend there all afternoon and evening,and I realy enjoy everything.You can see there some beautiful chinese show and",
          "I will recommend visit this place during within or winter. I was here last month, a lot of mosquitoes especially summer season , I strongly recommended bring mosquito repellent along during summer.",
          "I wasn\u2019t expecting much, but this place was so beautiful, the grounds alone need a good couple of hours at least to fully enjoy. We saw two shows, the horse riding stunt show and the Chinese culture show, both very good. We also paid for a boat tour, which took about 20-25",
          "Visited here prior to departing Shenzhen, interesting and you can fill 2-3 hours in quite easily. Limited places to eat however.",
          "200 RNB is too expensive for that kind of park, looks cheap and fake. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to any of my friends.",
          "A condensed view of old and new China and well worth a visit. If over 65 years then you can get free entry as long as you can prove age. Take your passport.",
          "very nice place in Nanshan district, a bit too crowded but we had a chance to see everything. I was particulary impressed by the the miniature of Great Wall of China. They also have Chinese Opera show and many places for street food. Overall was a positve experience spent with",
          "It is a large area. There is a lot of walking. Not many restaurants available. Very close to the underground train station. I found the entrance fees a bit steep.",
          "WOnder how they did this, its basically the whole of China famous and historical places in a park plus in miniature size, My advice, rent an buggy to tour the place. Is huge and there is showtime in certain places. Plan it properly and you will cover whole park.",
          "A bit of a taxi ride to get there, but worth the effort. Beautiful gardens and sights spread over a large area. Great to walk around and spend 3 hours",
          "Very easy go to this attraction. I looked ticket price for foreigner and local people is same 220 yuan. For foreigner it has previliege acces and dont join with local people acces. but i suggest dont go to this attraction on saturday and sunday is very crowded. All of the",
          "As with China in general, it\u2019s full of surprises. There are very authentic recreated houses from all over China, beautiful bridges and waterways. The food is OK, and each area has its own local style. The shows are worth the entry price alone, even the female acrobatic team is",
          "I been there with my family, that time very hot weather, but enough with the show for Chinese traditional dress up, and also we can take foto with the custom,pay rmb 100 for 3 foto inside the park...",
          "This is the place where you could learn about the people and their culture. They have several shows but for me the most interested show is the Legend of the Desert show. This park is for all ages and make sure you watch the final show.",
          "Their shows are worth the visit especially ethnic show where they show all tribal dresses through dances and Chinese gymnastics. Structural buildings in the place imitate from the real places in China such as Tibetan temple, the Great Wall, etc. But none of those things stuck",
          "I really love this place. If you have visited Window of the World, this place really recommended after that. Located in the same area with Splendid China, you can get in with the same ticket (RMB 200 for both). In this area you can enjoy performance from some China's folk. Don't",
          "I'm really love this place. You don't have to travelling too much in China, but you can meet most of iconic China's city symbol here. Just get of at Overseas China Town (OCT) station, walk ahead & you will reach this place. Ticket fee is RMB 200 (bundling with China's Folk",

          "I had a free afternoon and this was across the street from my hotel (over a pretty bridge.) It was a wonderful surprise. The shows featuring different areas of Chinese culture (music and dance) were terrific. The grounds are beautiful, and give you a wonderful glimpse into the",
          "Only got to go during the night time (which also means a cheaper ticket but less things to see), however I wasn't disappointed at all with all the food available, as well as the beautifully lit architecture! It is an extremely large park, with so much to see and a lot to learn",
          "This a a great place for tourists and residents who want to escape the city for a little bit. Costs about 200rmb to enter, but that includes the China Folk Villages. Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend there, there is a lot to see! Miniature villages, outdoor art,",
          "Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend here. It costs about 200rmb per adult. For those less able/inclined to walk, you can rent electric golf carts of various seating number to drive around. I did this with my mom, it was very comfortable. There are cultural displays,",
          "Loved it...I may a little partial because I love China. The visit to this park was a bonus. Tiny replicas of Chinese history. The details are amazing!!!!!",
          "I had strong reservations about visiting this as it has all the earmarks of a tourist trap, but I was happily proven wrong. To be sure, there are some (not many) tacky aspects to this, but the vast bulk of the attractions are quite wonderful. Especially interesting are the many",
          "Was taken to Splendid China Park on a Sunday as it was a day away from work. Notwithstanding a massive hangover, the park was something I was not expecting. There are many, many visual attractions, coupled up with songs, dancing and audience interactions throughout the park.",
          "Splendid park is a beautiful park , fee for entrance is a little high , 200 RMB per person , but it worth it for once to visit , park is very big and for visit all over it you will need 4-5 hours .",
          "This park was quite interesting. If you want to learn about the different peoples who are native to China, then this is a place for you. It gives a nice overview of the people and culture. Many shows give a small insight into the culture as well.",
          "Near \"Window to the World\" which take your around the most famous sites around the world, \"Splendid China\" do the same for China. It also include \"China Folk Cultural Village\". Take the whole day to really experiance the place.",
          "A park near Window of the world and Splendid China and Happy Valley. Plenty of shows from different Chinese ethnic groups.",
          "I have been to Splendid China many times! okay I live in Shenzhem... but I really love it! \u201cthis place including two areas (Splendid China Miniature Park & China Folk Culture Village) located in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. The park's theme reflects",
          "Many different Chinese minority\u2019s houses and landscape is shown. Good overview of China in short period of time is possible. Enjoyed it even if I am traveling to China since 20 + years",
          "We spent 3 hrs walking around this huge park which was really to short.. The park is an interesting collection of copies of cultural heritage of the different areas & people in China. They did also do performances on dances, stage shows etc..",

          "Being slightly apprehensive about what we would be getting for 300 rmb, we were sorry not to have more time to see everything. It is huge, well done, with representation of the chinese minorities, their houses and customs, landscaped park like areas, a big lake, attractions for",

          "It is not perfect but I wouldn't miss it. We hired a golf cart type of thing as we were short on time. Drove by houses and looked at how they used to live. Cute kids on school trips in uniform running around. Missed the folk shows since they are only in afternoon! There is a",
          "A must visit place if you want to see what the old China look like. Easy to reach by MTR. Ticket price is RMB 200 (adult), and half-price for children.",
          "The Chinese Folk Culture Village is adjacent to Splendid China and the entrance fee is for both.We found this park more interesting as we get to know the various minorities in China.We could take as many pictures as we wanted and see how they live.",
          "We chose to visit Splendid China Park instead of Windows of the World as the park offers an overview of the popular sites in China. It was quite interesting to see them in miniature and the park itself was easy to navigate .",
          "My wife and I spent over 6 hours and still missed some of the sights here as the sun went down. Lot's of walking. A great display of the sights of China. The Terracotta Soldiers display was very cool as was the great wall. Plan on taking over 100 pics. Get there early! The food",
          "Just beside window of the world you can find this beautiful, amazing Open avea. If you are in time. there will be some show.. In top five of city",
          "I went to Shenzhen on a business trip and one of my co-workers suggested this park to me and I am so grateful to her. This was my first trip to China, but since it was for business I obviously did not have enough time to travel around the country and see what China has to offer.",
          "We were impressed with the detail put into all the miniatures. You can leisurely walk though the park without pressure to move on. There is a main path with many small trails to walk through to see all the exhibits. The only negative was it was pretty expensive compared to other",
          "You can easily spend the entire day here, for approx $40! The park has 2 sections, the Cultural village and Splendid China. Staff speak very little english, so you are on your own. Ask for a map at the entrance which is in English and has all the necessary information. The park",
          "Splendid Park not just miniature and show. A lot of attraction can be found at here. Traditional minorities house can be found too. Much like TMII in Indonesia as both of them show their culture respectively. No much changed since visit in 2007. Only minor update at few",
          "I just loved to visit these attractions. This big park has two parts. One is the Splendid China part, it contains number of Chinese buildings and landscapes, miniatures of every interesting building and monument in China. Thus we experienced the historical places those I may",
          "This large property provides an opportunity for family and friends to enjoy \"a day in the park\" while seeing some of China's landmarks in miniature. The creators have done a splendid job. Excellent replicas of buildings and nature. The gardens are manicured and clean. Food",

          "After checking into the hotel, we'll go directly to China Folk Culture Village and Splendid China. Is a concentrated Chinese, That's lovely! Chinese drama performance is very good!",

          "Spendid China is a great place to visit to see a miniature representation of the major sights in China. Located in Shenzhen in a \"park-like\" setting, it is a great place to take children that enjoy the outdoors while enjoying seeing China's sights.",
          "If you visit Window of the world, you will see all landmarks of the world in one place. If you are visiting Splendid China Park, you are visiting all china in one place. it's very beautiful and I loved this place. Do not miss it!",
          "A good site that you can spend 1/2 day at. There are regular buggies hop on hop off and the exhibits are good with adequate explanation in Chinese and English",
          "Splendid China is a trully experience. A lot of miniatures show the several regions of China, including mini Great Wall and mini Forbidden City. The circuit ends in a Chinese Villa, with restaurants and shows. A must see in Shenzen!",
          "Nice day for a visit after lunch. Go for a walk to capture all the beautiful attractions in the park. Just stroll and explore.",
          "If you want to spend a nice afternoon, possibly with the family, this is the place. Huge park with plenty of attractions. you have to spend at least 4 hours.",
          "If Shenzhen is the start of a longer trip through China or if you want to come back to this country and don't know where to go, then you might like to wander in Splendid China park where you'll see all the great attractions in China, in a miniature scale. It's funny otherwise",
          "China Folk Culture Village is full of little houses supposed to depict the \"56\" ethnicities of the country. Even though it might seem a bit weird (like a \"human zoo\") it's actually very interesting and some horse-riding shows from Mongols and Manchus in traditional costumes make",
          "It is a great place to explore The country in a day, a lot number of live shows that we keep you enjoyed",
          "Well worth a visit. Very close to the metro with good directions. There is a lot of walking and lots to see. The shows are excellent. Make sure you see the horse riding and don't miss out on the mask changers! The food was very traditional.",
          "If you want to look at all Chinese marvels in a short time and in a cheap way this is exactly what you need. Mini copies of a lot of Chinese architecture ensembles, from the famous Great Wall and Forbidden City and up to remote mountain villages and Buddha statues. I was",
          "Much like Window of the World, Splendid China is meant to showcase major attractions. This time, it is the tourist attractions of China as opposed to the iconic sites of the world",
          "This is a nice place to visit and walk around for an afternoon. It's not the most exciting or thrilling place, but it's a relaxing trip. The translation of Chinese signs is a bit odd in most places. It's located very centrally so it's easy to get to and from from most places in",
          "It's a nice enough way to spend an afternoon but the whole place could do with a bit of TLC. There are some good views of the surrounding city. It's a good place to visit but not at the top of my list of things to do in Shenzhen.",
          "Interesting for those who likes Asian specially Chinese culture. But better to visit in Winters, Summer too hot to enjoy Splendid.",
          "This is a great place to visit . It showcases all the cultures and ethnic groups that are related to China . Very relaxing and well designed . Entry fee is reasonable and you can hire an English Speaking guide if you want . Very interesting place to go . A must do if you are in",
          "It's the sister park to Shenzhen's Window of the World. It shows miniatures of all the types of Chinese Architecture from History. It's a very large park so take plenty of water with you. The park also offers other attraction such as a horse show, a karate show and tradition",
          "See all of China in one place!!! Giant Buddha statues, palaces, temples, waterfalls, suspension bridge, monuments, statues and ancient cities all in miniature replicas of the originals. River boat rides and a fun zip cable ride over the river. The afternoon apparel show,",
          "I am personally a fan of the Asian cultures and Splendid gives a great insight in what is or has been important for China and what is part of its culture. The park is quite big, so if you would like to see everything, make sure you have the whole day and energy to walk around.",
          "The model buildings and monuments were very interesting, having seen a few of them for real. The museums were also pleasant to stroll around. Highlights were the shows staged at various points of the day. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The park offers a good glimpse of Chinese diversity. The show with horse-riding was fun to watch (but note when planning your visit that most shows take place in the afternoon). Note that the park is quite vast. Conveniently there is a metro station right by the entrance of the",
          "Me, my sister and my mother had no intentions of going to splendid China but somehow we ended up there. We took a chance and went in. Splendid China shows the actual arts,culture and history of China. They are very cordial and audience friendly. There are various shows",
          "great place to learn about culture and traditions of China. Make sure to have enough time for walking around and for splendid shows they organize. it was a big surprise that in the evening they organize water battles. it looks amazing both at night and during daylight times",
          "Upon entering Splendid,China, you will receive a brochure. This attraction is very large and actually didvide into two areas. It is important that you plan your tour around the major events or shows, so it is a good idea to sit and plan your day. This definitely is a full day",
          "This was a fabulous day in a beautiful park which showcases the ethnic village diversity of China. The entrance fee includes admission to all the shows, the horse battleground, the folklore apparel show and a spectacular finale, the dragon phoenix acrobatics, special effects,",
          "The day was very hot and there was no airconditioning in any of the facilities. Other than that, it was a fascinating day stepping in to al the 55+ cultures that make up the China provinces. I engaged some of the authentic people representing the cultures. Perhaps the most",
          "So many folk and tribe of China you can watch here. The culture that is vary and original will always make us admire the richness of China culture If you are in Shenzhen, this is just one stop you need to make to see Big China from small presentation.",
          "This place is underrated in my opinion. Unlike elsewhere in China, almost noone comes here which lends itself to relaxing walk through the wonders of China. The exhibits are very well done, many shows take place throughout the day and food and drink facilities are available. You",
          "Most people don't know about this place and it is definitely one of the must sees when in Shenzhen. The park offers great opportunity to immerse in Chinese culture without travelling through China. The exhibits are well done, the ground is spacious with electric bikes and",
          "Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China are both in the same park. Get off at OCT Metro and take exit D. Walk straight and you will see the park on the right. It opens at 10am. The admission fee is 180 yuan which you can access both the Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China.",
          "a very nice park demonstrating a little bit of what China is all about. Do not take the mini electrical car because it goes very fast and you will not be able to actually see anything. Better is to walk",
          "As i wrote in my previous review Nanshan District itself too beautiful to visit while visiting Shenzhen, This Chinese folk culture village is one of the best place and MUST SEE place while visit at Shenzhen, here you can see entire history of china under one roof, Chinese",
          "First off all Nanshan itself is beautiful district of Shenzhen city and this park is amazing,though you need to have atleast 3 hours time to visit this place properly though it's totally worth it if you are history lover or not! this miniatures are superb preciously made that",
          "You can feel traditional chinese culture here. It takes about 2~3 hrs to look around all places. There are three or four restaurant and snack bar. You can enjoy chinese style lamb skewer!",
          "Splendid China is an amazing walk through some of China's most important towns and cities. Located in Nanshan, approximately 20-30 minutes from Shekou, this beautifully sculptured park is really worth a visit. Each of the miniature towns have been superbly recreated in detail",
          "for those who have not been to China, it certainly is a window to see the major attractions in half a day but in minature, indulging in the cultural performances as well as savouring the titbits and food from various cities, suitable also for education to learn about the",
          "As a China zoomed in, detailed, there are most of Chinese famous places. You will be pleased with designation of this park such as many trees, lowers, resting benchmarks, performing area. If you are tired because of walking, you can rent horse or self-driving cars Be careful",
          "A good insight into some of the culture of China and in a safe and nice place that is relaxed and enjoyable. the only thing is that it is specifically for tourists.",
          "If you go to Shenzhen you must to go to this place. Is good to start early, because is to visit all day. The best part is at evening with the presentation of the circus and dances. To visit all ancient architecture and see how wonderful is China, the Culture behind. I",
          "This was a beautiful Garden area with lots of history on China. I enjoyed the many buildings and statues. Beware-they do not speak any English here. So I did not know that there were bicycles you could rent to get all over the park...which would of been so nice vs. walking the",
          "If you are looking for inspiration for things to experience in China it would be recommended. The place itself is not very impressive and I would say not worth the money.",
          "Do not forget to visit Chinese Folk Culture Village during your trip to Shenzhen. The most interesting part for me was the tribe villages all around China.",
          "Hugely built and miniatures to the detail. Must watch.. Do get s portrait painted in less than 20 minutes with the artist in the complex.",
          "It is divided into two parks. One is a miniature Park and folk village is a showcase of all cultures within China. If you plan to spend a full day, hire the electric vehicle and you can roam around in it and enjoy the park. If you have been to Windows of the world, the",
          "I'm bored just thinking about this boring place. So boring. So incredibly terribly boring. Yes, its tiny villages. Wow. So boring.",
          "Despite its attempt to be a cultural doorway to the past, it just isn't authentic enough to achieve that. I go here for long walks. Kids will be completely bored in ten minutes. This is the place to go to de-stress and escape from the Big City, nothing more.",
          "Fabulous tourist park with replica houses from Chinese Provinces mixed with amusements and China in miniature! Not expensive on about 180 rmb so \u00a320 and you could easily spend the whole day there. Worth a visit!",
          "It was nice to see all the different Chinese cultures all in one place. Although my 8 year old didn't like it, The grown ups enjoyed. If you don't like walking, you can rent a golf cart (timed basis ) up to 2 people and drive around the park.",
          "Splendid China is a great place to visit for couples, or families. The grounds are beautiful and a high level of detail has gone into creating the miniature versions of iconic scenes gathered from across China and scaled down to a size that enables you to experience many of",
          "Came in with tour arrangement and only have 1 day to explore Shenzen. Found this attraction quite interesting but too bad did not have enough time to explore as we need to go inside the stadium to see the dance show.",
          "This is a combined Park. The miniature Splendid China and the insight in the broad variety of cultures in China. Start your visit with the Chinese Folk Culture Park. After your entry to the right. Take the time to visit the variety of houses and cultures. Be in time for the",
          "This time my second visit with different group.of friends. I love the scenery and landscape of this China man made park. Beautiful China traditional house, beautiful landscape and garden although some of the trees or flowers are fake! They made from plastic! But we found the",
          "We spent half a day there and was only able to see half the park. Get a mobile scooter if you want to see the whole park in a day but you will miss a lot. Best to walk if you can. Seniors get in for free (at least we did). park is adjacent to OCT metro terminal and is very easy",
          "we spend full day here. fee to enter is 180 RMB per person. if you do not have time to see all china, this is a place to see it all, Bejing,Shanghai,.....",
          "I really love this place! It's massive with all the attractions. Managed to watch the horse-riding battle and also many cultural performances!",
          "We came here on a day trip from Hong Kong as we were on a 3 day layover in Hong Kong, so we didn't know what to expect. We were very, very pleasantly surprised. We spent only 2 hours at the park as that is what Splendid Travel, our travel agency has planned for us, and it was",
          "This is a TOP sight in SHENZHEN, CHINA. All visitors to SHENZHEN must visit this sight, even the TOP officers from BEIJING. The sight starts from the day when SHENZHEN moves from a small village to be reformed into one of the top financial city in the south rivals even SHANGHAI.",
          "Amazing china famous miniature. It has 2 great performance. Awesome lighting, costumes, stage design but their stories isn't quit good. Awesome lighting, better come till night. Rare staff can speak english. Must check visitor paspor",
          "It was very exiting tour where you can see many culture sites of China, status and other objects, it was easy to go there using taxi, the ticket price is not expensive, it was very exiting tour and I advice tourists to go there during their visit to China, cheers",
          "The park itself is a bit cheesy. The best part of seeing a mock up of the Great Wall and other all China heritage sites is the walk around the park. The cultural dance show was amazing. Different styles representing different Chinese ethnic groups and provinces made the visit",
          "An nice day out to see artworks or all types and the markets are great if you time it right. A variety of handcrafted items such as paper carving and sketches and there aremany shops with pottery and various other Chinese cultural activities.",
          "5 minutes after arriving we wanted to leave. Hot and many people. However we rented a golf cart to drive around splendid china, which goes through many different areas and periods of time in China's history. I am so glad we stayed as we ended up having a fabulous time there.",
          "Got here only to watch the show There are two show, indoor and outdoor show The indoor show is a bit boring, I fell asleep during the show But the outdoor show is amazing, you can see a cultural show with acrobatic scene Really worth the watch",
          "I was not really sure about going there, some friends recommended it so I went, and this place was my BEST experience in Shenzhen seriously, I took so many selfies and pictures of the magical places, even if I went alone, everyone agreed to take pictures for me everyone is so",
          "Although the entrance ticket is not cheap, there are 2 main sights. One of the, is Splendid China, a miniature China if you like and a village show casing the 56 races in China. We took the donkey cart as we had 3 kids with us and R the rate of RMB400 for some75 min of guided",
          "Okay so this park is huge, there is a whole mini china which is wonderful to see everything China has to offer in miniature. Its a cannot miss park. There are different areas to see, such as a lake, shows,etc. The animal area was disgusting, the poor monkeys were caged in a",
          "Nice Park in Shenzhen. Just outside the OCT Station (green Line) take Exit D and you are there. It is nicely made and you can see all or almost all landmarks from china as mini replicas. The Park seems pretty well maintained and clean. I visited also the Horse Battle Show. Was",
          "There is NOTHING of historical value in Shenzhen so they built this. It is sort of run down but a good place if you dont have time to see other parts of China. Just know that this is a tourist trap and the great wall is not so great. It is 12 inches tall.",
          "This is a nice park in an interesting set up. Many elements of chinese cultures can be seen, either as buildings, mini parks or shows. There is a small train you can take through it, will stop wherever you want. Great fun for a couple of hours",
          "If you don't have a lot of time to see a lot of China it is a great way to get an insight into the diverse cultures traditions and landscapes of all over China. I think it is worth seeing. Plus Windows of the World is next door that was fun too.",
          "Out of towners step on the models to take pictures of themselves on them even though clearly marked to stay out. Bumpkin behaviour typical of some people here. Not enough guards. You can tell a lot of work went into making the models and I wonder what the artists think of",
          "Great place to visit. It is a virtual visit in the whole China. One need to spend 1 full day to see every single miniature.",
          "The Chinese Folk Culture Village is now unified with the Splendid China Park and you can visit both with the same ticket. It's a place where you can come closer to all the races throughout the Chinese territory from Muslims to Hindu and from the Korean minority to people living",
          "It's the absolute way of an overview and a virtual visit in the whole China's history and monuments! Hundreds of Chinese monuments in miniatures, from the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, up to the Summer Palace and to less known monuments. Constructed in the highest level of",
          "It is nice to visit here...but need english translation. Many staffs do not speak english make tourists difficult to understand what message they speak during show. It is recommended place to be visit in shen zhen.",
          "I really had my hopes high when i got there, i thought \"hi, this is a great way to get to know chinese tradition and history\". in fact it was boring, hot, long, and boring... go elsewhere. sorry for the bad review, i simply didn't like it.",
          "I love Chinese culture and history. So that was why I visited this place. Beautiful and gave me chance to see and learnt about Chinese folk culture.",
          "Splendid China really helped me to see China in mini version. This place similar to Madurodam in Netherland, but because we were in China and I love chinese history so I did not want to miss any chance to visit this place. So, whenever you are in Shenzhen, do not miss Splendid",
          "Its a nice place to spend a full day in culture of china. The dance shows were nice to watch, variety of shows there. Indoor cultural show at 5pm not to be missed.",
          "The two parks are combined for an entrance fee of 180 yuan. The park is huge and there is a lot of ground to cover but environment is very serene. The food is not so great and quite overpriced. You're better off packing a picnic and enjoying your meal in a quiet part of the park.",
          "Splendid China provides an overview of the historic sites of China in miniature. You can either walk the park, 1-2 hours, or rent a small scooter. They also have a variety of venues showcasing Chinese culture. The food court is small but offers a good selection.",
          "Really gives an insight into china and it's history. Superb model recreations. One of the the most beautiful places I have been",
          "Liked this place a lot. If you want to learn chinese culture in one day this is a nice way of doing it. Take comfortable shoes.",
          "Splendid China consists of Folk Culture Village and Miniature Park. One can either explore Splendid China by foot or take tram ride to see both areas. One can also rent a single seat or a double-seat scooter to see Splendid China. What I liked most was the wonderful evening",
          "all the major architecture and tourist attractions of China are miniaturised in this theme park. It's great if you are visiting China for the first time and just want a quick taste. or use it as an introductory visit",
          "We met up with some friends to spend the day there but the weather was very hot.Great sightseeing as I would say its a must see attraction.",
          "such amazing park with beautiful miniatures around the world its good to be there on the spring season",
          "A constructed village putting on a display that is carefully planned. The show theatre had tiny seats making an hour there uncomfortable.",
          "Splendid China and China Folk Culture Village is a theme park that lies close to Window of the World. Splendid China has miniature replicas of some of China\u2019s best known landmarks, like the Great Wall of China and the Summer Palace. Most attractions are in the scale of 1:15.",
          "China has decided to embrace it's different cultures within its borders and give it a theme park like experience. There are a few things for younger kids to burn off a bit of energy. A few events did not have English translation available:-( but lots of credit for having it",
          "Although it requires particular interest in some Chinese history and iconic places, but still nice place but not for the whole day. You can combine any other place with it .... may be Window of the world",
          "A very well done theme park, China Folk Culture Village give you a bird's eye view of the many monument scattered around China. Also know locally as Splendid China, it is a quick walk from the Windows of the World metro station. I went with my parents and was surprised that even",
          "There are interesting attraction here. Visitors can enjoy Miniature World Heritage of China and Riding horses show. Here is good place to enjoy holiday with Family.",
          "Almost need a full day to see everything. I would recommend seeing the miniature replicas of China first as there was no lighting in that area and we ran out of time to see that after spending so long in the folk villages with all the interesting exhibits and friendly people.",
          "It has all the attractions everywhere in China located in one place. You can visit the Great Wall, the Potala Palace, the Forbidden City, the Sun Yat Sen Memorial, and the original Three Gorges (before it's flooded by the dam). For a quick review of all the important sites in",

          "I went there on January 2015. It was a big area which consists various attraction such as dance and theatrical culture, there is also a miniature of many iconic places in China. If you too tired, to look around the area by walk, you can take a car to go around.",
          "This place is demonstration old Chinese culture. Small models of old buildings & locations like Great Wall. Can see some street dramas as well.Laser shows at evenings as well. Chinese old music was interesting.This place was nicely maintained by the management. But this is not",

          "If you don't have time to visit the whole China, this is the place to be. Shenzhen is a young city, they built this to attract tourists. But we always enjoyed our visit to this place.",
          "It was part of the program while attending a medical conference. The light n dance show was pretty good, but short of impressive. Expected a Face Change act, but didn't happen. It's mostly Chinese traditional dance with a whiff of post modern contemporary attempt, while",
          "We were lucky enough to visit with a local guide, but a great time learning about the culture. If you don't speak Chinese a translator well be required but what a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.",
          "I found that it's a nice place to visit with your family. It's very commercialized though. Do not rent the electric car because you can use it on most roads inside.",
          "OMG what a cute place! it's like mini china and you get to see it all in once day. come prepared with water bottles and a good pair of shoes, dont come on a hot day or a rainy day you'll just hate it. also, it's costly",
          "Negative: - These 2 parks are combined, so ticket prices include both (though there's no real separation in the building layout). It was pricey - almost $30 per ticket. - My suggestion - do NOT go when it is hot (we had whiny kids, thirsty kids, hot kids, tired kids...). Due to",
          "Very nice park. Need some time to spend on this park. So many nice places to see. Very nice to see the historical culture.",
          "I was lucky enough to be taken to the Splendid China Park. The work that has gone making of ancient Chinese cities models. Not sure exactly how many models there are. I would have liked another day there. The Great Wall of China was the most fascinating to me. Some of the",
          "Very friendly people. Multi-generational activities. We had a wonderful time! I want to go back this next time.",
          "After 10years I came back to this park. Authentic as it is, lots of miniature of the famous places all over china, Forbidden City, Shi Shan Ling, Great wall, and my most favourite part is the chinese folk culture show which shows every day at 7.30pm",
          "It's good place for children. It constrain interesting views and models. It was not crossed on Saturday. Also this place opens at 9 30 am.",
          "If you want a one day tour of the Whole of China this is the place to visit. A lot of walking to do but the shows are a must watch. Sovenior shopping inside is also relatively cheap.",
          "small little thing. but cute. not many things to do in SZ so this is one of the few things in the city so it's worth your while if you have a few days here",
          "We went there without any preparation but we were not disappointed. The weather was good and we had a enjoyable walk tough the park. The whole build-up with mini buildings was very nice to watch. I would go there again if I come by Shenzhen again.",
          "I don't feel the reviews online gave enough hard info, so I am hoping to help others after spending an afternoon at this site. First, the Folk Village and Splendid China are two parks that have been merged into one. It's 180 RMB entrance fee for foreigners to get into both",
          "This one is worth visiting, it's not too over the top and it's a mixture of relaxing things to see and escapism, you can go off and explore on your own to find things of interest.",
          "Cute, but overall disappointing. If you want to see a collection of the other things you should be seeing in China, this is the place for you. Shenzhen really has very little history of its own, so they've tried to co-opt other parts of China for this park.",
          "I enjoyed the shows, very clean and nice place to visit and kill time. I'd stay away from the street food offered there, though",
          "A 'theme park' but with very little buz. To be fair we visited Spendid China in Florida which is steets ahead. This park is co-located with the Folk Village and on my visit attracted about 10% of the visitors walking about as the Folk Village. Maybe for those who have not 'done'",
          "This is a 'theme park' that is designed to celebrate the many minorities in china. To sum up there is the Han and the rest are minorities. Language, customs, dress, music it's all there. Do not treat as authentic more as illustration/information gathering but worthwhile.",
          "Quite large park where people can get an overview of China. Animations, food stands, small shops, everything is available inside. A good way to spend an afternoon for example",
          "Ok, went here with a sales person I deal with in Shenzhen. What a surprise, I was expecting the usual Chinese glitz.....but this place was just an oasis, absolutely beautiful and more than worth the visit",
          "The China Cultural village is China in a park. It contains all of the highlights of China in a \"mini-town\" kind of way. The park is massive and quite exhausting.",
          "It is a beautiful place; but visit if you know already about Chinese culture and history; because there is not acceptable English guidance about background of you are seeing.",
          "Interesting for foreigners like me. It's a good opportunity to see different places of China in one single place",
          "One ticket gets you into both Splendid China and Chinese Folk Culture Village. I spent almost an entire day admiring the miniature replicas of Chinese attractions and learning the historical culture of China. Although miniature in size, the replicas are detailed and appears to",

          "On a business trip to Southern China, we were taken by our hosts on a tour of this amazing park. It really is wonderful and provides a fantastic overview of Chinese culture and history. If you're on a short trip to Shenzen, this is well worth checking out",
          "We spent several hours here and I was pretty bored. Its kind of like the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu but not as polished and the people didn't speak much or any English so you couldn't talk to the people from the different villages. It was pretty empty when we were",
          "I lived in Shenzhen for several years. During that time I took visitors to many of the attractions in the city. This time I took my daughter to Spendid China. Most of our time was spent on the 'miniatures' side of the park before attending the costume show complete with",

          "Splendid China and China Folk Village are combined, so one ticket gives you access to both. They are a good combination with splendid China being a miniature depiction of the styles of architecture and natural scenery of China. The miniature wall is very good....not so",
          "Visited the place with family for a day and I'm sadly to say the place is quite not deserve the ticket price(180RMB). The whole area is big and had various famous architecture in mini size. However, the statues were not protected well and the whole environment was not maintained",
          "It was very good quality for China! Lots to see and do, and open areas to wander about. There were some great models of places that really are spectacular in China - its a great advert for the country. There were small shows and a cinema show we saw. You have to be on the ball a",
          "It's a huger Park, with many greens and tress with a wonderful design. But the Main Attraction are the different 'villages' from every tribe in China. They offers different shows. With 180 rmb, I think its a little overpriced (Kids 90) under 150 cm free, but still I liked it.",

          "We were given wrong information on which metro station to exit. By the time we got to the park it was about 3 hours to closing. The only show we were able to get to was really interesting and worth going to even if it was all in Mandarin. The park is a little dirty and",

          "My husband and I visited Splendid China during the Chinese New Year. The park is divided into two sections. One has life-size replicas of different places around China. The other side has miniatures. There were plenty of shops and shows in between for a small fee but well",
          "The replicas blew me away. The Great Wall and Imperial Palace especially but so much of the replicas were amazing. It just makes me want to come back and see more of China outside of the Golden Triangle. The replicas themselves would have been enough but the ethnic village",
          "We went during the International Women's day and I got my entrance tickets at half price (original price is rmb180 per person). The huge park could be divided into three parts: the mini China sceneries, the cultural experience China street, and the China tribal minorities",
          "This is a great place to teach international elementary students about Chinese culture and the diversity in its population. Some great performance of the different minority groups from all over China. Our student especially enjoyed the performances that were interactive. Easily",
          "Our chinese hosts took us there - it was either that or Window of the World, and apart from the peculiar aspects of some of the miniature models of the clay warriers or Mongolia, it was actually a very nice 4 hours spent. Some of the exhibitions and gardens were nicely done.",
          "A lot of things to see and to learn, a must go! Near the window of the world, which is also a must see. A very satisfying day trip!",
          "This was a seriously under rated venue. By far the high light of my visit to Shenzhen and is a whole day event. Both educational and fun whit so much to do and see all for a mere 180rmb but really worth every penny. Miniature china and amusements to delight all the family.",

          "This is an amazing tourist park with replicas of much of different parts and times in China. Much of it is interactive and would appeal to people of all ages. The map was in English too and at each exhibit, an explanation was written and narrated in both Chinese and English. It",

          "Quite crowded and a bit disappointing particularly if you have visited the actual sites around China depicted here in miniature. Pretty unremarkable overall.",
          "This attraction is a really good to way to experience the Chinese vision of its own history. the shows and interactive performances are great fun. The highlight would have to be the dance show, fantastic",
          "This place was the highlight of my visit to Shenzhen. Some people might say it's too commercial replica of the villages in interior China but it is great concept of many things under one roof as it would take huge efforts to traverse China to see the authentic villages. The",

          "Little has changed from my last visits some 12 years ago. Its an interesting tour through the many Chinese nationalities. I found the evening show really fun but my companion thought it was a bit cheesey. Prices were a lot higher then my last visit, not helped by the currency",
          "I last visited this attraction some 12 years ago. It was average then and to be frank it really hasn't changed very much. But if you are in shenzhen with time to kill then you could drop worse then this. The price in my opinion is rather high",

          "Splendid China is aptly named... it is the right adjective used to describe a theme park that offers so much more than one can take in on a day out. The evening show/performance (7.30 pm) by itself would already be worth the price (180 Yuan) one pays to enter Splendid China.",

        "wiki": "Shenzhen (; Chinese: \u6df1\u5733; Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0282\u0259\u0301n.\u0288\u0282\u0259\u0302n] (listen)) is a major sub-provincial city on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.\nShenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy\u2014made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of \"reform and opening-up\" in 1979. The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media China's Silicon Valley. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s, and has been ranked second on the list \"top 10 cities to visit in 2019\" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon. In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special economic zone. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000, but local police and authorities estimate the population at about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Evergrande Group, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD. Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index. It has the third busiest container port in the world.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest known recorded mention of the name zhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields \"zhen\" (Chinese: \u5733; lit.: 'ditch, drain'). Shenzhen was named after a deep (Chinese: \u6df1; lit.: 'deep') drain that was located within the area.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to Ming era ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Since then, this area has seen human activity from more than 6,700 years ago, with Shenzhen's historic counties first established 1,700 years ago, and the historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, which was built on the area that is now Shenzhen, established more than 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.\nIn 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin Dynasty, the area went under the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai County, one of three counties that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai County into two counties: Dongguan County in the north and Bao'an County in the south, with both under the administration of Dongguan Prefecture. In 590, the Sui administration merged Dongguan County and Bao'an County back into Nanhai County, and set the local government in the town of Nantou, though this was reversed by the Tang administration in 757.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the Yuan Dynasty. In the early Ming era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou. In 1573, the Ming administration dissolved Bao'an County to establish Xin'an County, based in Nantou, which had authority over regions that would be Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Xin'an County's economy primarily was based on the production and trade of salt, tea, spices, and rice.\n\n\n=== Qing-era to 1940s ===\nTo prevent a rebellion from Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, on the Chinese coast, the recently established Qing administration re-organized coastal provinces. As a result, Xin'an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan County and was later incorporated into Dongguan in 1669, though Xin'an was restored about 15 years later, in 1684. As of 1688, there were 28 towns in Xin'an County, of which one of the towns is named Shenzhen. When the Qing lost to the United Kingdom in both Opium Wars in 1842 and 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island were ceded from Xin'an to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking. On 21 April 1898, the Qing government signed a \"Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong's Borders\" with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin'an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Shenzhen was occupied by the British under Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of Hong Kong for half-a-year in 1899. From the 3,076 square kilometres (1,188 sq mi) of territory that Xin'an held before the treaties, 1,055.61 square kilometres (407.57 sq mi) of the county's land was ceded to the British.\n\nIn response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin'an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public, and the last stop of the Chinese side, named Shenzhen Railway Station at the town of Shenzhen, which had opened recently, helped the town's economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin'an County back to Bao'an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province. During the Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931, Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino. While only in operation until 1936, they significantly increased KCR's passenger traffic to and from Shenzhen.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao'an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong. When Japan surrendered on May 1945, the Bao'an County government moved back to Nantou. \n\n\n=== 1950s to 1970s ===\nIn 1953, four years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Bao'an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the city was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao'an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.\nIn January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the \"Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report\" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the \"Report on the Request for the Change of Bao'an County to Shenzhen\". On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.\nOn 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose \"to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading\" based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng's leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.\nAt the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a \"trade cooperation zone\" in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the \"Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income\" and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration.\n\n\n=== Special Economic Zone (1980s\u2013present) ===\n\nIn May 1980, the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as an SEZ, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\". On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the \"Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.\" Under these regulations, Shenzhen formulated a series of preferential policies to attract foreign investment, including business autonomy, taxation, land use, foreign exchange management, product sales, and entry and exit management. Through the processing of incoming materials, compensation trade, joint ventures, cooperative operations, sole proprietorship, and leasing, the city has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and helped popularize and enable rapid development of the SEZ concept.\n\nIn March 1981, Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial city. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). In November 1988, Shenzhen became a separate city (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02), meaning that the city can implement policies that are different from those in the national plan, and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration.In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials' Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen's administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.On 1 July 2010, the State Council dissolved the \"second line,\" and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.\" In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly-established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.On 18 August 2019, the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economical, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, intending to have the SEZ be a model city for others in China to follow.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.\nOver 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River, Maozhou River and Longgang River.Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most of them fall under the territory of neighbouring areas such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. But there are several islands under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou. (See List of islands in Shenzhen)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlthough Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 10 July 1980.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Shenzhen is structured in a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary (currently Wang Weizhong), outranks the Mayor (currently Chen Rugui). The party's standing committee acts as the top policy formulation body, and is typically composed of 11 members.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nShenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative Districts and one New District:\n\nSpecial Economic Zone Border\nTo enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.\nOn 1 July 2010, the original SEZ border control was cancelled, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to the whole city. The area of Shenzhen SEZ thus increased from 396 square kilometres (153 sq mi) to 1,953 square kilometres (754 sq mi). Since June 2015 the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ. Although the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been extended to cover the whole of Shenzhen, colloquially Shenzhen is still said to be separated into two areas, with the original four districts comprising the SEZ before 2010 as \"simplified Chinese: \u5173\u5185; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u5167; pinyin: gu\u0101n n\u00e8i; Jyutping: gwaan1 noi6; lit.: 'within the border') and the rest known as \"\u5173\u5916; \u95dc\u5916; gu\u0101n w\u00e0i; gwaan1 ngoi6; 'outside of the border').\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShenzhen was the first of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to be established by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As a SEZ, Shenzhen is given the privilege to embrace market capitalism policies under the guise of \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,\" unlike other cities in Mainland China which is based on a planned economy. As of 2018, Shenzhen has a nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion), which recently had surpassed neighboring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 2.29 trillion RMB (HK$2.68 trillion), making the economic output of Shenzhen the third largest out of Chinese cities, trailing behind Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, Shenzhen's GDP growth between 2016 and 2017 of 8.8% surpassed that of Hong Kong and Singapore, with 3.7% and 2.5% respectively. With a market capitalization of US$2.5 trillion as of 30 November 2018, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is the 8th largest exchange in the world.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nShenzhen's industry is described by its Municipal Bureau of Statistics to be upheld by its four-pillar industries: high-tech, finance, logistics, and culture. Shenzhen is primarily known for its high-tech industry, which has a value of 585.491 billion RMB (US$82.9 billion) in 2015, a 13% increase compared to last year. Out of the nominal GDP of 1,750.299 billion RMB in 2015, the high-tech industry comprises 33.4% of this amount. Shenzhen is home to a number of prominent tech firms, such as telecommunications and electronics corporation Huawei, internet giant and holding conglomerate Tencent, drone-maker DJI, and telecommunications company ZTE. Shenzhen annually holds the China International High-tech Achievements Fair, which showcases high-tech products and provides for dialogue and investment for high-tech. As a result, Shenzhen is dubbed by media outlets as \"China's Silicon Valley\" or the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware\" for the world.\nIn addition to its numerous high-tech companies, Shenzhen is also home to a number of large financial institutions, such as China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance and its subsidiary Ping An Bank. Since the city's establishment as a SEZ, a number of foreign banks had established offices in the city, including Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. In total, the financial industry accounts for 14.5% of the city's nominal GDP in 2015 (254.282 billion RMB), which was a 15.9% increase over the previous year. By the end of 2016, the total assets of the financial industry amounted to 12.7 trillion RMB (banking industry assets were 7.85 trillion RMB, security companies assets were 1.25 trillion RMB, and insurance industry assets were 3.6 trillion RMB), making Shenzhen's financial industry the third largest in China. In addition, Shenzhen is one of the world's top ten financial centers as of 2019, jumping five places to ninth place as determined by \"variety of areas of competitiveness, including business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial sector development and reputation.\"Addressing the logistics industry, courier SF Express and shipping company China International Marine Containers (CIMC) have their headquarters in Shenzhen.  The Port of Shenzhen, composed of Yantian International Container Terminals, Chiwan Container Terminals, Shekou Container Terminals, China Merchants Port and Shenzhen Haixing (Mawan port), handled a record number of containers with rising trade increased cargo shipments in 2005, ranking it as the world's third-busiest port. Together, the logistics industry accounts for around 10.1% (178.27 billion RMB) of the city's nominal GDP in 2015, which was an increase of 9.4%.Shenzhen had prioritized the cultural industry in according to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and planning the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. On 7 December 2008, UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network, and awarded the Shenzhen the title of \"United Nations Design Capital.\" Altogether, the cultural industry in turn contributes to 5.8% (102.116 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015.\nIn addition to the four pillar industries that was listed by the municipal government, Shenzhen also has a relatively notable real-estate industry. The real-estate industry altogether contributes to 9.2% (162.777 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015, which was an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Real estate developers such as Vanke and China Resources Land are headquartered within the city.\nAs a SEZ, Shenzhen has established several industrial zones to encourage economic activities. The Shekou Industrial Zone was approved and established back in 31 January 1979 by the Central Committee of the CPC to assist in the \"Hong Kong-based\" economy of Shenzhen. In 1996, the State Council approved and established the 11.5 km2 (4.4 sq mi) Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Development Zone, helping to develop Shenzhen's high-tech industry in areas such as electronics and information technology. In accordance to the National Plan in 2001, the Shenzhen Software Park, integrated within the High-tech Industrial Development Zone, was established for software production and assist in the development of the city's software industry. On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\" to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of \u2018top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its \"12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city's scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation. In 2015, the tourism industry's total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1% increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28% (35 billion RMB or US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2% from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51% increase from 2010.\n\nShenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings. Most of the tourist attractions are part of Overseas Chinese Town (OCT), a colloquial name for parks owned by OCT Enterprises and is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. These include the Window of the World, the Splendid China Folk Village, Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37), OCT East, and OCT Harbour. Other theme parks include Shekou Sea World (\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e16\u754c), Xiaomeisha Sea World, and the now-closed Minsk World. Shenzhen also has a number of popular public parks and beaches, such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, Wutongshan Park, Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa'). The city is also home to tall buildings such as the Ping An Finance Centre, KK100, and the Shun Hing Square (also known as Di Wang Tower).Shenzhen's tourism industry is recently expanding under the \"13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. Part of the plan includes organizing the tourist industry within five brands: theme parks, retail, natural recreational areas, sports, and international gatherings, as well as speeding up construction of future tourist attractions and turning Shenzhen into a Chinese hub for sports.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail is an important pillar of Shenzhen's tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen's tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion), retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen's FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.\n\nHuaqiang North (\u534e\u5f3a\u5317) is one of Shenzhen's notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world. Luohu Commercial City, a commercial complex located adjacent to Shenzhen Railway Station, is noted for having a variety of products that ranges from electronics and counterfeit goods to tailored suits and curtains. In addition to Huaqiang North and Luohu Commercial City, Shenzhen has numerous shopping malls and commercial areas, including COCO Park and its branches COCO City and Longgang COCO Park, Uniworld (\u58f9\u65b9\u5929\u5730), Uniwalk (\u58f9\u65b9\u573a), and Coastal City(\u6d77\u5cb8\u57ce).\"Smart retail\", which uses technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in production, circulation, and sales of consumer goods, has been growing popular within enterprises in Shenzhen. Businesses in Shenzhen are encouraged to use the Internet to develop the consumer market and new retail projects would be assisted with the use of technology. In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of \"smart retail\", with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a \"new retail\" hub.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nShenzhen is considered as a major innovation hub of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Over the years it has become one of the most important research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centers in the country.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nShenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China, with a population of 12,528,300 in the city as of 2017. With a total area of 1,992 km\u00b2, Shenzhen has a population density of 6,889 inhabitants per square kilometre. The encompassing metropolitan area of the city was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 23.3 million. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world's largest urban area according to the World Bank, and has a population of over 108.5 million according to the 2015 census.Before Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. However, since become a SEZ, Shenzhen has become a hub for migrants searching for work and opportunities within the city.\n\n\n=== Historic ===\nThere had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is Mandarin that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.\nShenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of the world's factory.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment. The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012\u201313, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a yoy increase of 500,000.\n\n\n=== Other statistics ===\nAt present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.The population structure has great diversity, ranging from intellectuals with a high level of education to migrant workers with poor education. It was reported in June 2007 that more than 20 percent of China's PhD graduates had worked in Shenzhen. Shenzhen was also elected as one of the top 10 cities in China for expatriates. Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.\nAccording to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen. Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is restricted.\nMainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an \"Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao\". Shenzhen residents can have a special 1 year multiple-journey endorsement (but maximum 1 visit per week starting from April 13, 2015) This type of exit endorsement is only issued to people who have hukou in certain regions.(See Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau.)\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n==== Koreans ====\n\nAs of 2007 there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. As of 2014 Donghai had about 200 Korean families.South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, Korean International School in Shenzhen. As of 2007 there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. As of 2014 spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nPrior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Rd. was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century. Younger generations of the Cantonese communities now speak the more standard version. Today, some aboriginals of the Cantonese and Hakka speaking communities disperse into urban settlements (e.g. apartments and villas), but most of them are still clustering in their traditional urban and suburban villages.The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city's linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism is on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers begin to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, local languages such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew are still commonly spoken among locals. Hokkien and Xiang are also sometimes observed.According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant churches, Catholic churches, and mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37% of Shenzhen's residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26% were Buddhists, 18% Taoists, 2% Christians and 2% Muslims; 15% were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn general, Shenzhen is a relatively safe city. However, in districts such as Bao'an and Longgang, the number of robberies, extortion, kidnapping, and fraud exceeds the national average. In the central part of the Luohu District, especially in the neighborhoods around the Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal, and the Luohu Commercial City Shopping Center, pickpocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. In addition, Luohu is a major center for trade in counterfeit goods and abundant in its nightclubs, bars, and karaoke salons, which not only attracts Shenzhen residents, but also residents from neighboring Hong Kong, which may attract criminal elements. The Nanshan District has a large concentration of foreigners, and is known for its abundance of prostitutes and beggars. Along with local gangs in Shenzhen, there is a notable presence of triads: notably Wo Shing Wo, Big Circle Gang, Sun Yee On, 14K, and Shui Fong. The level of corruption in the government is usually high, as seen in the arrest of the then-mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng, for accepting bribes in June 2009, as well as arrests and convictions of Li Yugo, the former head of the largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a customs officer of the city, for the same reasons.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nShenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as \"the world leader completing new skyscrapers,\" as it managed to complete 14 skyscrapers that are above 200 meters in 2018, four more than Dubai, and keeping this title for three years. In addition, the city is home to the most number of skyscrapers above 200 meters than any other cities in the world, with 82 completed as of July 2019. The city is ranked the third in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 223 of them completed as of July 2019, after Hong Kong and New York City. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 60 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2019. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599-meter, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. The second-tallest building is the Kingkey 100, rising 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and containing 100 floors of office and hotel spaces. Shenzhen is also the home to the Shun Hing Square (Diwang Building), the tallest in Asia (if the antenna is taken into account) when it was built in 1996. Guomao Building was furthermore the tallest building in China when it was completed in 1985.In addition to the Shenzhen's modern skyscrapers, Shenzhen also has a significant number of historical buildings. Chiwan Fort is located on a small seaside hill in the Nanshan District. Today, what is left only represents a fragment of the large fortress, as it was partially destroyed by the British during the Opium Wars. Tianhou Temple in the Nanshan District is dedicated to the goddess Mazu, a tutelary deity for fishermen and sailors. According to legend, the temple was founded in 1410 by Admiral Zheng He after his fleet survived a strong storm in the Pearl River Delta. The temple is repeatedly rebuilt and repaired. Part of the temple was converted to a museum, but the rest still continues to function as a religious building. The tomb of the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Bing, is located in the Nanshan district. The modern tomb dates back to the end of the 19th century, when a Hong Kong clan announced one of the imperial tombs after a long search, though this is disputed by historians. The tomb was reconstructed at the beginning of the 20th century, but later it fell into neglect until it was restored again in the 1980s. Dapin Fortress is located in the eastern part of the city, in the same area. It was built in 1394 to protect the coast from pirates and in 1571 suffered a long siege of Japanese corsairs. It later turned into a typical town during the Qing Dynasty, and during the First Opium War, the fortress garrison participated in the fight against the British. Walls and gates, narrow streets, temples, and the residence of the commandant in the fortress are still preserved today.  There is an old fortified Hakka village in the Longgang District, whose the architectural features of which are complemented by the Hakka Culture Museum.\n\nThe old town of Nantou (or Xin'an), located in the Nanshan District, has several historical sites dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. From the 4th century, there existed a significant city, but today most of the old buildings have been replaced by modern buildings. However, there are still a few historical buildings, such as fortress walls and gates dating back to the Ming period, the Guandi Temple (Guan Yu), some military and civilian buildings (for example, the residence of officials, the shop, and the opium house), and several streets.\n\n\n=== Parks and beaches ===\n\nShenzhen offers free admission to over of its twenty public city parks such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, and Wutongshan Park. The Xianhu Botanical Garden (\u4ed9\u6e56; 'Fairy Lake'), founded in 1982, is spread around the lake of the same name in the Luohu District on an area of 590 hectares. On one of the hills of the garden is Hunfa Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Shenzhen, which was built in 1985 on the site of an older shrine. Around the lake are a pagoda, tea houses, pavilions, the Museum of Paleontology, a garden of medicinal plants and an azalea garden. Wutongshan National Park (\u68a7\u6850\u5c71) is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station. Lianhuashan Park (\u83b2\u82b1\u5c71; Lotus Hill) is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of the mountain is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. The Shenzhen Garden and Flower Exposition Center, established in the Futian District in 2004 for the International Garden Exhibition, has many gardens of various styles, artificial ponds and waterfalls, a pagoda, pavilions, and statues. The Shenzhen Bay Park opened in 2011 which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay. The Shenzhen Safari Park in the Nanshan District combines a zoo and a large zoological center on a territory of 120 hectares. Xili Lake Resort (\u897f\u4e3d\u6e56), located in the Nanshan District, has a park with springs and waterfalls stretching around the lake, surrounded by a canopy, and a pagoda and a pavilion located on the top of Xili Mountain. Zhongshan Park (\u4e2d\u5c71), located in the Nanshan District, is the city's oldest park. It has several artificial lakes and ponds, an old city wall dating back to the 14th century, and many sculptures and monuments, including one of Sun Yat-sen. The Yangtai Mountain Forest Park is located around the 500-meter Yangtai Mountain (\u7f8a\u53f0\u5c71) in the Bao'an District. Nearby the mountain is Shiyan Lake (\u77f3\u5ca9\u6e56), which became a popular place of Xin'an County in the 16th century. It is famous for its several indoor and outdoor pools with hot thermal waters.Shenzhen has several beaches: Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa') in the Yantian District, and Jinshawan (\u91d1\u6c99\u6e7e; 'golden sands bay'), Nan'ao (\u5357\u6fb3; 'southern inlet'), and Xichong (\u897f\u51b2) in Dapeng Peninsula (in the vicinity of Dapeng New District, which is administered by the Longgang District).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBefore the 1980s, Shenzhen's education system was primarily based on primary and limited secondary schooling, with no residents admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. Shenzhen started implementing policies that will help develop a more high-quality education system, borrowing teachers from the best schools in the country with promises of higher pay and benefits. In addition, the city started building new schools and renovating the infrastructure of its existing schools to give teachers a more comfortable environment to teach.In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen's first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China's top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the innovative Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Institute of Technology. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.The 9-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. Secondary schools such as Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School, all of which have an on-line rate of over 90%, are dubbed as \"Shenzhen's four famous schools.\" As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools.According to Laurie Chen of the South China Morning Post, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou's count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen's by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nShenzhen is the second largest transportation hub in Guangdong and South China, trailing behind the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shenzhen has a developed extensive public transportation system, covering rapid transit, buses and taxis, most of which can be accessed by either using a Shenzhen Tong card or using QR codes generated by WeChat mini programs.\nRegarding air transport, Shenzhen is served by its own Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and the neighboring Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). Located 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the center of the city, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport serves as the main hub for passenger airlines Shenzhen Airlines and Donghai Airlines and a main hub for cargo airlines Jade Cargo International, SF Airlines, and UPS Airlines. Together, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport handled 49,348,950 passengers, 355,907 aircraft, and 1,218,502.2 cargo in 2018, making it the 5th busiest airport in China in terms of passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport in the country in terms of aircraft and cargo traffic. In addition to flying through Bao'an International Airport, ticketed passengers can also take ferries from the Shekou Cruise Centre and the Fuyong Ferry Terminal to the Skypier at Hong Kong International Airport. There are also coach bus services connecting Shenzhen with HKIA.\nThe Shenzhen Metro serves as the city's rapid transit system. The extension opened on 8 December 2019 put the network at 303.4 kilometres (188.5 miles) of trackage operating on 8 lines with 215 stations. By 2030 the network is planned to be 8 express and 24 non-express lines totalling 1142 kilometres of trackage. The average daily metro ridership in 2016 is 3.54 million passengers, which accounts for a third of public transportation users in the city. The metro also operates a tram system in the Longhua District.\n\nShenzhen is served by seven inter-city railway stations: Futian, Guangmingcheng, Pingshan, Shenzhen (also known as Luohu Railway Station) Shenzhen East, Shenzhen North, and Shenzhen West. High-speed rail (HSR) lines that go through the city are the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, and the Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen railway (forms part of the Hangzhou\u2013Fuzhou\u2013Shenzhen passenger railway). Non-HSR lines that go through Shenzhen are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway (forms part of the Kowloon\u2013Canton railway) and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.\nAs of August 2019, the city's bus system encompasses over 900 lines, with a total of over 16,000 electric vehicles, the largest of its kind in the world. The system is operated by multiple companies. As at January 2019 conversion of Shenzhen's taxi fleet to electric vehicles reached 99%. Electric taxis have a blue and white colour scheme. Petroleum fuelled taxis are coloured either green or red.Shenzhen serves as a fabric to China's expressway system. Expressways within the city include the Meiguan Expressway (part of the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway), the Jihe Expressway (part of the G15 Shenhai Expressway), the Yanba Expressway (part of the S30 Huishen Costal Expressway), the S28 Shuiguan Expressway, the Yanpai Expressway (part of the G25 Changshen Expressway and the S27 Renshen Expressway), and the S33 Nanguang Expressway. In response to being rejected from being a part of the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, Shenzhen is constructing a bridge across the Pearl River Delta to connect the city of Zhongshan.Private car ownership has been on the rise in Shenzhen, with the city having over 3.14 million cars in 2014. In response, the city imposed limits on car purchases to reduce traffic and pollution. The purchase of electric cars will be determined by a lottery, while traditional cars will be determined both a lottery and a bidding process. In addition, the city banned passenger vehicles with license plates issued in other places from four of Shenzhen's main districts during peak times on working days as of 29 December 2014.\n\nShenzhen is connected with Hong Kong (city and airport), Zhuhai and Macau through ferries that leave from and arrive at the Shekou Cruise Center. The Fuyong Passenger Terminal in the Bao'an District provide services to and from Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) and Macau (Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal). The Port of Shenzhen is the third busiest container port in the world, handling 27.7 million TEUs in 2018.Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has the largest number of entry and exit ports, the largest number of entry and exit personnel, and the largest traffic volume in China. Shenzhen is busiest in China when it comes to border crossings, with people entering and exiting the country through the city and Hong Kong reaching 239 million in 2015. In the same year, a total of 15.5 million vehicles crossed the border in Shenzhen, a 0.4% increase of last year.  Border crossing ports include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, and Luohu Port. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAs Shenzhen is located in Guangdong, the city historically has a Cantonese culture before its transition to a SEZ. Migrants coming to the city to find work and opportunities have turned Shenzhen into a cultural melting pot. Despite this, the municipal government and some of the residents living in Shenzhen, including those who are not from Guangdong, have invested in keeping and reflecting off the city's Cantonese heritage. Shenzhen has presented itself as a city of opportunity for young people in China. The competitive culture that the city promotes among the youth have resulted in the term \"Shenzhen speed,\" which describes a period of constant competition, quick changes, and high-efficiency.In 2003, the municipal government announced plans to turned Shenzhen into a cultural city by promoting design, animation, and library construction. The municipal government also intends to develop the city's cultural industry in accordance to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. Shenzhen's cultural industry specializes in being one of the largest handicraft manufacturers in China, and is also an industry center for oil painting in bases such as Dafen Village. Shenzhen also hosts the Shenzhen International Cultural Fair which specializes as an expo for the world's cultural industries, with the first expo being on November 2004. As a result of these developments, Shenzhen was awarded by UNESCO the title of \"United Nations Design Capital\" and was accepted entry into the Creative Cities Network on 7 December 2008.\n\nAs part of turning Shenzhen into a cultural city, the municipal government established the \"Library City\" (\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e4b\u57ce) concept in 2003. The plan would create a library network within the city through library construction, service improvement, and create a comfortable reading environment.  By the end of 2015, Shenzhen has 620 public libraries, including 3 city-level public libraries, 8 district-level public libraries, and 609 grassroots libraries.  Notable libraries include the Shenzhen Library and the Shenzhen Children's Library. Shenzhen also has bookstores, with the most notable being Shenzhen Book City in the Futian District. With an operating area of 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft), it claimed to be the largest bookstore of Asia at the time of its opening. Shenzhen has a number of museums and art galleries, such as the Shenzhen Museum, the Shenzhen Art Museum, the Shekou Maritime Museum, the Longgang Museum of Hakka Culture, the Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art, and the He Xiangning Art Museum. Shenzhen also has a few theaters, notably the Shenzhen Concert Hall, the Shenzhen Grand Theater, and the Shenzhen Poly Theater.\n\nAs with Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province, the main cuisine of Shenzhen is Cantonese. However, due to the recent growth of migrants to the city, Shenzhen also hosts a diverse array of cuisines, from Chinese cuisines such as Chaozhou cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hu Cuisine, and Xiang Cuisine, as well as foreign cuisines such as Korean, Japanese, French, and American. The Yantian District is known for its Chaozhou-based and Hakka-based seafood, with restaurants lined up along the coastline.  Some recreational areas in Shenzhen such as Xianhu Botanical Garden, Donghu Park, and Xiaomeisha, host barbecues where visitors bring their own food.  Street food such as Xinjiang lamb skewers, Northern Chinese pancakes, and black sesame soups, can be found in Xijie Street and the urban village of Baishizhou. Shenzhen also has its own tea culture. In regards to food chains, first McDonald's restaurant in mainland China opened for business in Shenzhen on 8 October 1990, providing the city American fast food. Shenzhen is home to the HeyTea chain of tea shops, which provides a variety of cheese and fruit teas and is popular among social media.Shenzhen has a prominent nightlife culture, with most of the activity centered in the entertainment complexes of COCO Park and Shekou, with the former being referred by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) as \"Shenzhen's answer to Lan Kwai Fong.\" There are many bars and clubs in the city, mostly unregulated, that stay open till the morning.  Tunnel raves, referred by the SCMP as \"a Shenzhen nightlife staple\", have earned a reputation in the world, though they are often cracked down by police.  Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui (\u6c99\u5634\u6751) in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShenzhen is the home to professional football team Shenzhen F.C., which participates in both China League One and the Chinese Super League. Another local football team, Shenzhen Ledman F.C., was once a part of China League Two until the club was disbanded in 2018. Shenzhen's top-tier basketball team, the Shenzhen Aviators, plays in the Southern Division of the Chinese Basketball Association. Shenzhen F.C. and the Shenzhen Aviators both are tenants of the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre.\nShenzhen Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that hosts many events. The stadium is located in Futian District and has a capacity of 32,500. It was built in June 1993, at a cost of 141 million RMB. The 26th Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen in August 2011. Shenzhen has constructed the sports venues for this first major sporting event in the city.Shenzhen Dayun Arena is a multipurpose arena.  It was completed in 2011 for the 2011 Summer Universiade.  It is used for the basketball, ice hockey and gymnastics events.  The arena is the home of the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\nShenzhen is also a popular destination for skateboarders from all over the world, due to the architecture of the city and its lax skate laws.The Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre was one of the venues at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 2019 to 2028 Shenzhen is hosting the WTA Finals, a major annual professional tennis tournament for the world's most top-ranked female players.\n\n\n== Relationship with Hong Kong ==\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below. Except where noted the statistics are taken from sections of the Hong Kong Government website.As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 teus/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary, while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.\n\nTrade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333 billion of imports of which US$298 billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card (Home Return Permit) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of Zhongshan on the Western side: the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge.\n\n\n==== Qianhai ====\n\nQianhai, which means foresea in Chinese language, formally known as the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone, is \"a useful exploration for China to create a new opening up layout with a more open economic system.\" A 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi) area located in western Shenzhen, Qianhai lies at the heart of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to Shenzhen international airport. Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta. With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from HSBC, \"This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nShenzhen has an advanced public media network, boasting one radio station, two TV stations, three broadcasting and TV centers, 19 cable broadcasting and TV sub-stations. In Shenzhen, there are 14 newspapers, one comprehensive publishing house, three video-audio products publishing houses, 88 bureaus of inland and Hong Kong media organizations, 40 periodicals, and about 200 kinds of in-house publications of which the majority belong to enterprises. The most prominent media companies in Shenzhen are the Shenzhen Media Group, the Shenzhen Press Group, China Entertainment Television (CETV), and Phoenix Television branch iFeng.Shenzhen News (\u6df1\u5733\u665a\u62a5, sznews.com) is a Chinese-language newspaper owned by the Shenzhen Press Group that serves as Shenzhen's main online new source. Shenzhen Daily is an English-language news outlet for Shenzhen. It also covers local, national and international news. That's Shenzhen is the Shenzhen edition of That's PRD, an English-language media company with an online, print and social footprint. That's Shenzhen covers news, arts, lifestyle and events in the city. ShekouDaily.com is an online media outlet providing news and resources that focus on the Shekou sub-district in Nanshan District of Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nShenzhen has been very active in cultivating sister city relationships. In October 1989, Shenzhen Mayor Li Hao and a delegation travelled to Houston to attend the signing ceremony establishing a sister city relationship between Houston and Shenzhen. Houston became the first sister city of Shenzhen. Up to 2015, Shenzhen has established sister city relationship with 25 cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Other twinnings ===\nThe Shenzhen Port is twinned and has collaboration agreements with:\n\n The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, June 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Shenzhen-related articles\nAdministrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\nEconomy of China\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPearl River (China)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBach, Jonathan (August 2010). \"\"THEY COME IN PEASANTS AND LEAVE CITIZENS\": Urban Villages and the Making of Shenzhen, China\".

          "It is a nice place to spend with family and kids late afternoons, watching the sunset, having a little picnic and do some yoga. I go to the park very often since it also have a wide bicycle road, which gives me the chance to do cardio while kids are playing on the grass..",
          "A really well-maintained seaside park with multiple esplanades for walking and riding bikes. As for the latter, I would most certainly have done this if I could have gotten the bike rental apps to work. Apparently you need to set up a separate Chinese App Store account to be",

          "Like many other Shenzhen attractions, the park is easily reached by the Shenzhen Metro, which has a stop directly in the park. From the exit it is a very short walk to a promenade along Shenzhen Bay. You can also see the new bridge from the mainland to Hong Kong. A great place",
          "If I had to stay in Shenzhen longer, this would have become my favorite place to visit at week-ends to stroll along the waterfront or through the mangrove forest, jog, ride a bicycle or just relax with my family and friends at one of the multiple lawns. There is an IMAX cinema",

          "I went there for a short sunset walk during my one-day trip to Shenzhen and it's a really pleasant place to see. The park itself is nice but the boulevard with views towards the bay and HK are just lovely! If you're not into theme parks or shopping while in Shenzhen, definitely",
          "We took the metro to Hongshuwan Metro Line 2 late afternoon then walked South to Shenzhen Bay Park. Then we walked East, stopping several times to watch the families, joggers and cyclists enjoying the end of the day. As the night fell it was magical looking both East and West",

          "Totally worth to try! It is a nice park with the view to Hong Kong!You can rent a bike there and bike from Nanshan to Futian District or viceversa. I suggest not to go on Weekends as it is very crowed and does not give you the opportunity to enjoy the nature and view.",

          "One of the best Ecological Parks in China! I enjoyed walking along the bay and jogged in the morning for 5 km or more! The total length was said to be 18km but I think it's only about 15km. The cool breeze keeps you a bit cool on a humid summer day. Other than the humidity, I",
          "More than 10 kilometers long seaside view makes you so relaxed to enjoy the nature. The park is so long to have different parts that you will find different funs on each part. To watch birds and blooming flowers in spring, to take bicycling and walking in autumn and winter, even",
          "Bring your bike and come when the kids are in school. Ideally you need to go on a week day when the crowds are away. This is a really nice view of the bay and you go all the way down to the huge bridge that goes to HK. If you're there at the weekends watch out for the tandem",
          "A long park, or several parks built along the coastline of Shenzhen Bay, total length is about 17 km. Great coastal view and you can Hong Kong on most of the days. With your wife, or girl friend, or your kids, walking or bicycling. Good weather or bad.",
          "Park is more for strolling along a long coastline than for large open family areas. Many people are renting the bikes to travel the park as it is very long and narrow. Annoying to walk and dodge bikes!",
          "Beautiful place to walk along the coast. Ducks and birds and plenty of greenery. Recommend riding a bike there also. I've walked it at day and night. Really reminded me of home. Top 10 thing to do in sz in my opinion",

          "It is nice to get to stroll down a park next to the ocean after a huge dinner. This is the spot and there is a lot of locals here so it is pretty safe at least to me it felt that way.",
          "A nice place to hire a bike and take a leisurely cycle along the coast. It's not the most picturesque place in Shenzhen, but it's worth a trip on a sunday evening.",
          "Both the day and night are excellent times to visit. Though, be warned, it can get packed with locals. The view is wonderful and it's a great place to walk, jog, ride a bike, or just sit and enjoy the moment and view. It may be difficult catching a taxi when you leave so using",
          "from Seaworld to Futian - with possible extension both ends - best flat cycle path in Shenzhen. Recommend week days as weekends too crowded.",
          "This is a great park with many paths that can be used for both walking and cycling... It is about 10.7 km from one end to the other along Shenzhen Bay from Shekou to Qiao Cheng Dong... It can be very crowded Monday - Friday between 17:00 and 22:00... On the weekends it is",

          "I went for a walk without a map and approached the park from the South. I walked all the way past the big bridge, but didn't really have a way identified to get out. Ended up standing on the street and waited for a cab. Not many cabs in this part of town! Good park, plenty of",
          "A very beautiful and new park for cycling. Simply hire a bike for yourself or for 2 persons and 1 child and go. You can go to the \u00dcniversiade statue and to the suspension bridge connecting Hongkong with China. For a nice day out of the busy Shenzhen",
          "It is a large sidewalk along the coast, which can provide a beautiful view of the bay, if you are lucky to go there in a sunny day. Besides a relaxing walk, not so much to do there. Apparently you can rent bikes as well, even I havent seen any shops there. If you dont have much",
          "I had a pleasant and relaxed walk here while staying at the Hotel Kapok Shenzhen Bay. The walk wends its way alongside the coast with views across to HongKong. There was, to its detriment, a slightly unpleasant smell much of the time but it was fun to see so many locals",
          "Stretching from the Futian Mangrove Ecological Park in the east to the Shenzhen-Hongkong Bridge in Nanshan in the west, the newly opened and currently undergoing development Shenzhen Bay Park (\u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) is the longest coastal park in Shenzhen. The park incorporates the Mangrove",
          "We started at the Mangrove Nature Reserve and walked for 6km along the shore on a sunny day and forgot the sunblock. It was good to walk by the sea with the cooling breeze. They are planting thousands of mature trees which are good now but will be fantastic in 10 years time."

          "Seems that this is one of the places the citizens use for relaxation during the weekends. When I visited it was people everywhere; walking, running, biking and relaxing in the grass with their friends. Bike rental is cheap, but it seems that many Chinese people are bad at",
          "Do find some time to visit this place. You can get a perfect skyline view of Shenzhen Bay and also Futian CBD. Stunning view. And also the Hong Kong bridge. Totally worth coming and a picture perfect place to grab a photo. Surprisingly, this place is very very clean.",
          "It is a nice place to spend with family and kids late afternoons, watching the sunset, having a little picnic and do some yoga. I go to the park very often since it also have a wide bicycle road, which gives me the chance to do cardio while kids are playing on the grass..",
          "A really well-maintained seaside park with multiple esplanades for walking and riding bikes. As for the latter, I would most certainly have done this if I could have gotten the bike rental apps to work. Apparently you need to set up a separate Chinese App Store account to be",
          "I spent a whole morning here biking around. You can rent the Mobikes and Ofo bikes super convenient here just outside the subway stop. The weather was beautiful and there was a fresh breeze. Was fascinates me the most is the palm threes that give a really tropical feeling of",
          "If you want to know the culture of a city, you have to walk through it, it is the best way to understand the people. Shenzhen is a big city of electronic devices but the citizen still need a little bit of green space. That is what they did with the promenade along Shenzhen bay.",
          "Just a simple park. A long way along the water, without any chance to go out before end of the road. Possibility to ride a bicycle. Some places are smelly, maybe receiving wasted water from city.",
          "Get out early (especially on weekends) to enjoy about 20km of running, walking, or biking paths. The boardwalks tend to fill up fast in the mid-morning and throughout the day with Chinese meandering and clogging the boardwalks. There seems to be a 3-5k race every Sat/Sun...",
          "actually a hideaway in the middle of the City. A pretty busy hide away, but still cozy, nice atmosphere. You can rent bikes, many kiosks, cafes, but not overly commercialized. It's still a piece of nature and a kind of peaceful. As an alternative to the malls and other",
          "The amenities here are fantastic: to see Honk Kong Bridge and the harbors, to bike along the sidewalks, to watch people as they walk hand in hand, to learn about the fauna and flora of the harbour, to enjoy tea at various cafes along the bay, and take in the sun rays and have a",
          "Like many other Shenzhen attractions, the park is easily reached by the Shenzhen Metro, which has a stop directly in the park. From the exit it is a very short walk to a promenade along Shenzhen Bay. You can also see the new bridge from the mainland to Hong Kong. A great place",
          "If I had to stay in Shenzhen longer, this would have become my favorite place to visit at week-ends to stroll along the waterfront or through the mangrove forest, jog, ride a bicycle or just relax with my family and friends at one of the multiple lawns. There is an IMAX cinema",
          "If you're looking for a good place to go for a jog or ride your bike, this is the place. It has a 20+ km strand for walking and biking. Usually very crowded in the evenings and on weekends, so navigating on a bike at high speed can be difficult.",
          "The bay is very large and so quiet. It is a very good place for relax. We rode bicycles there and visited the wonderful night views. But you'd better protect yourself from the mosquitoes during hot days.",
          "We traveled out by metro and a short walk takes you to the sea view promenade - wide paths along the seashore with many trees and shelters to provide respite from the sun - toilets and various food and drink stall available. A nice change once you've had your fill of the hustle",
          "Nice park to visit on good days with not much air pollution. Can be very busy in the weekends, but a must see when visiting Shenzhen",
          "Have a beautiful view. Unfortunately, we went there is a wrong timing...A very hot weather, can't really enjoy it. Suggest visit in the morning or late evening!",
          "I went there for a short sunset walk during my one-day trip to Shenzhen and it's a really pleasant place to see. The park itself is nice but the boulevard with views towards the bay and HK are just lovely! If you're not into theme parks or shopping while in Shenzhen, definitely",
          "We took the metro to Hongshuwan Metro Line 2 late afternoon then walked South to Shenzhen Bay Park. Then we walked East, stopping several times to watch the families, joggers and cyclists enjoying the end of the day. As the night fell it was magical looking both East and West",
          "Great views across the bay to HK, be prepared for plentyof people also taking a stroll and cycling. No activities, just a lovely walk in the breeze as an escape from the city.",
          "Totally worth to try! It is a nice park with the view to Hong Kong!You can rent a bike there and bike from Nanshan to Futian District or viceversa. I suggest not to go on Weekends as it is very crowed and does not give you the opportunity to enjoy the nature and view.",
          "we walked all of it in one day. the park is great but it smells awfully in some parts of it. loads of benches and cycle hire places",
          "Visited Bay Park on Friday afternoon with my host father who lives in Shenzhen. I was in awe of the views and found it absolutely stunning to be able to see so far. There are many piers to stop and take photos, there are a few vendors to stop for food or drink and you can hire",
          "It is our weekly biking destination. Great sea view with as glimpse of HK. It is a well-planned park so getting there is so easy.",
          "One of the best Ecological Parks in China! I enjoyed walking along the bay and jogged in the morning for 5 km or more! The total length was said to be 18km but I think it's only about 15km. The cool breeze keeps you a bit cool on a humid summer day. Other than the humidity, I",
          "More than 10 kilometers long seaside view makes you so relaxed to enjoy the nature. The park is so long to have different parts that you will find different funs on each part. To watch birds and blooming flowers in spring, to take bicycling and walking in autumn and winter, even",
          "Bring your bike and come when the kids are in school. Ideally you need to go on a week day when the crowds are away. This is a really nice view of the bay and you go all the way down to the huge bridge that goes to HK. If you're there at the weekends watch out for the tandem",
          "A long park, or several parks built along the coastline of Shenzhen Bay, total length is about 17 km. Great coastal view and you can Hong Kong on most of the days. With your wife, or girl friend, or your kids, walking or bicycling. Good weather or bad.",
          "Park is more for strolling along a long coastline than for large open family areas. Many people are renting the bikes to travel the park as it is very long and narrow. Annoying to walk and dodge bikes!",
          "Beautiful place to walk along the coast. Ducks and birds and plenty of greenery. Recommend riding a bike there also. I've walked it at day and night. Really reminded me of home. Top 10 thing to do in sz in my opinion",
          "Nice plant selection and refreshing bay breezes. Very clean. Lots of people - became increasingly more crowded as the afternoon progressed (which seems true for most of the parks).",
          "I recomend to rent a bicycle and ride around the bay on the boardwalk.You can stop and relax as there are plenty of benches along the way.Its a great place to exercise too.",
          "It is nice to get to stroll down a park next to the ocean after a huge dinner. This is the spot and there is a lot of locals here so it is pretty safe at least to me it felt that way.",
          "A nice place to hire a bike and take a leisurely cycle along the coast. It's not the most picturesque place in Shenzhen, but it's worth a trip on a sunday evening.",
          "Both the day and night are excellent times to visit. Though, be warned, it can get packed with locals. The view is wonderful and it's a great place to walk, jog, ride a bike, or just sit and enjoy the moment and view. It may be difficult catching a taxi when you leave so using",
          "from Seaworld to Futian - with possible extension both ends - best flat cycle path in Shenzhen. Recommend week days as weekends too crowded.",
          "This is a great park with many paths that can be used for both walking and cycling... It is about 10.7 km from one end to the other along Shenzhen Bay from Shekou to Qiao Cheng Dong... It can be very crowded Monday - Friday between 17:00 and 22:00... On the weekends it is",
          "Drove through on our way to visit a wind turbine farm. Would have loved more time here as it is an absolutely splendid part of Shenzhen. Can recommend.",
          "one of the most amazing place to visit at Shenzhen, Most amazing sea view across the city and amazing place to hangout",

          "We couldn't believe how lovely this park was in Shenzhen. We were able to check it out on the way out to the Linkin Park show. Crazy to think this green and parkland exists in Shenzhen. Check it out.",
          "I went for a walk without a map and approached the park from the South. I walked all the way past the big bridge, but didn't really have a way identified to get out. Ended up standing on the street and waited for a cab. Not many cabs in this part of town! Good park, plenty of",
          "A very beautiful and new park for cycling. Simply hire a bike for yourself or for 2 persons and 1 child and go. You can go to the \u00dcniversiade statue and to the suspension bridge connecting Hongkong with China. For a nice day out of the busy Shenzhen",
          "It is a large sidewalk along the coast, which can provide a beautiful view of the bay, if you are lucky to go there in a sunny day. Besides a relaxing walk, not so much to do there. Apparently you can rent bikes as well, even I havent seen any shops there. If you dont have much",
          "I had a pleasant and relaxed walk here while staying at the Hotel Kapok Shenzhen Bay. The walk wends its way alongside the coast with views across to HongKong. There was, to its detriment, a slightly unpleasant smell much of the time but it was fun to see so many locals",
          "Stretching from the Futian Mangrove Ecological Park in the east to the Shenzhen-Hongkong Bridge in Nanshan in the west, the newly opened and currently undergoing development Shenzhen Bay Park (\u6df1\u5733\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) is the longest coastal park in Shenzhen. The park incorporates the Mangrove",
          "We started at the Mangrove Nature Reserve and walked for 6km along the shore on a sunny day and forgot the sunblock. It was good to walk by the sea with the cooling breeze. They are planting thousands of mature trees which are good now but will be fantastic in 10 years time."

        "wiki": "Shenzhen (; Chinese: \u6df1\u5733; Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0282\u0259\u0301n.\u0288\u0282\u0259\u0302n] (listen)) is a major sub-provincial city on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.\nShenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy\u2014made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of \"reform and opening-up\" in 1979. The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media China's Silicon Valley. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s, and has been ranked second on the list \"top 10 cities to visit in 2019\" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon. In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special economic zone. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000, but local police and authorities estimate the population at about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Evergrande Group, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD. Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index. It has the third busiest container port in the world.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest known recorded mention of the name zhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields \"zhen\" (Chinese: \u5733; lit.: 'ditch, drain'). Shenzhen was named after a deep (Chinese: \u6df1; lit.: 'deep') drain that was located within the area.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to Ming era ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Since then, this area has seen human activity from more than 6,700 years ago, with Shenzhen's historic counties first established 1,700 years ago, and the historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, which was built on the area that is now Shenzhen, established more than 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.\nIn 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin Dynasty, the area went under the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai County, one of three counties that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai County into two counties: Dongguan County in the north and Bao'an County in the south, with both under the administration of Dongguan Prefecture. In 590, the Sui administration merged Dongguan County and Bao'an County back into Nanhai County, and set the local government in the town of Nantou, though this was reversed by the Tang administration in 757.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the Yuan Dynasty. In the early Ming era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou. In 1573, the Ming administration dissolved Bao'an County to establish Xin'an County, based in Nantou, which had authority over regions that would be Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Xin'an County's economy primarily was based on the production and trade of salt, tea, spices, and rice.\n\n\n=== Qing-era to 1940s ===\nTo prevent a rebellion from Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, on the Chinese coast, the recently established Qing administration re-organized coastal provinces. As a result, Xin'an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan County and was later incorporated into Dongguan in 1669, though Xin'an was restored about 15 years later, in 1684. As of 1688, there were 28 towns in Xin'an County, of which one of the towns is named Shenzhen. When the Qing lost to the United Kingdom in both Opium Wars in 1842 and 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island were ceded from Xin'an to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking. On 21 April 1898, the Qing government signed a \"Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong's Borders\" with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin'an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Shenzhen was occupied by the British under Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of Hong Kong for half-a-year in 1899. From the 3,076 square kilometres (1,188 sq mi) of territory that Xin'an held before the treaties, 1,055.61 square kilometres (407.57 sq mi) of the county's land was ceded to the British.\n\nIn response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin'an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public, and the last stop of the Chinese side, named Shenzhen Railway Station at the town of Shenzhen, which had opened recently, helped the town's economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin'an County back to Bao'an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province. During the Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931, Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino. While only in operation until 1936, they significantly increased KCR's passenger traffic to and from Shenzhen.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao'an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong. When Japan surrendered on May 1945, the Bao'an County government moved back to Nantou. \n\n\n=== 1950s to 1970s ===\nIn 1953, four years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Bao'an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the city was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao'an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.\nIn January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the \"Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report\" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the \"Report on the Request for the Change of Bao'an County to Shenzhen\". On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.\nOn 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose \"to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading\" based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng's leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.\nAt the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a \"trade cooperation zone\" in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the \"Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income\" and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration.\n\n\n=== Special Economic Zone (1980s\u2013present) ===\n\nIn May 1980, the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as an SEZ, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\". On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the \"Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.\" Under these regulations, Shenzhen formulated a series of preferential policies to attract foreign investment, including business autonomy, taxation, land use, foreign exchange management, product sales, and entry and exit management. Through the processing of incoming materials, compensation trade, joint ventures, cooperative operations, sole proprietorship, and leasing, the city has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and helped popularize and enable rapid development of the SEZ concept.\n\nIn March 1981, Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial city. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). In November 1988, Shenzhen became a separate city (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02), meaning that the city can implement policies that are different from those in the national plan, and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration.In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials' Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen's administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.On 1 July 2010, the State Council dissolved the \"second line,\" and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.\" In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly-established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.On 18 August 2019, the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economical, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, intending to have the SEZ be a model city for others in China to follow.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.\nOver 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River, Maozhou River and Longgang River.Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most of them fall under the territory of neighbouring areas such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. But there are several islands under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou. (See List of islands in Shenzhen)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlthough Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 10 July 1980.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Shenzhen is structured in a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary (currently Wang Weizhong), outranks the Mayor (currently Chen Rugui). The party's standing committee acts as the top policy formulation body, and is typically composed of 11 members.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nShenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative Districts and one New District:\n\nSpecial Economic Zone Border\nTo enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.\nOn 1 July 2010, the original SEZ border control was cancelled, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to the whole city. The area of Shenzhen SEZ thus increased from 396 square kilometres (153 sq mi) to 1,953 square kilometres (754 sq mi). Since June 2015 the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ. Although the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been extended to cover the whole of Shenzhen, colloquially Shenzhen is still said to be separated into two areas, with the original four districts comprising the SEZ before 2010 as \"simplified Chinese: \u5173\u5185; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u5167; pinyin: gu\u0101n n\u00e8i; Jyutping: gwaan1 noi6; lit.: 'within the border') and the rest known as \"\u5173\u5916; \u95dc\u5916; gu\u0101n w\u00e0i; gwaan1 ngoi6; 'outside of the border').\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShenzhen was the first of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to be established by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As a SEZ, Shenzhen is given the privilege to embrace market capitalism policies under the guise of \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,\" unlike other cities in Mainland China which is based on a planned economy. As of 2018, Shenzhen has a nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion), which recently had surpassed neighboring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 2.29 trillion RMB (HK$2.68 trillion), making the economic output of Shenzhen the third largest out of Chinese cities, trailing behind Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, Shenzhen's GDP growth between 2016 and 2017 of 8.8% surpassed that of Hong Kong and Singapore, with 3.7% and 2.5% respectively. With a market capitalization of US$2.5 trillion as of 30 November 2018, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is the 8th largest exchange in the world.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nShenzhen's industry is described by its Municipal Bureau of Statistics to be upheld by its four-pillar industries: high-tech, finance, logistics, and culture. Shenzhen is primarily known for its high-tech industry, which has a value of 585.491 billion RMB (US$82.9 billion) in 2015, a 13% increase compared to last year. Out of the nominal GDP of 1,750.299 billion RMB in 2015, the high-tech industry comprises 33.4% of this amount. Shenzhen is home to a number of prominent tech firms, such as telecommunications and electronics corporation Huawei, internet giant and holding conglomerate Tencent, drone-maker DJI, and telecommunications company ZTE. Shenzhen annually holds the China International High-tech Achievements Fair, which showcases high-tech products and provides for dialogue and investment for high-tech. As a result, Shenzhen is dubbed by media outlets as \"China's Silicon Valley\" or the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware\" for the world.\nIn addition to its numerous high-tech companies, Shenzhen is also home to a number of large financial institutions, such as China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance and its subsidiary Ping An Bank. Since the city's establishment as a SEZ, a number of foreign banks had established offices in the city, including Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. In total, the financial industry accounts for 14.5% of the city's nominal GDP in 2015 (254.282 billion RMB), which was a 15.9% increase over the previous year. By the end of 2016, the total assets of the financial industry amounted to 12.7 trillion RMB (banking industry assets were 7.85 trillion RMB, security companies assets were 1.25 trillion RMB, and insurance industry assets were 3.6 trillion RMB), making Shenzhen's financial industry the third largest in China. In addition, Shenzhen is one of the world's top ten financial centers as of 2019, jumping five places to ninth place as determined by \"variety of areas of competitiveness, including business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial sector development and reputation.\"Addressing the logistics industry, courier SF Express and shipping company China International Marine Containers (CIMC) have their headquarters in Shenzhen.  The Port of Shenzhen, composed of Yantian International Container Terminals, Chiwan Container Terminals, Shekou Container Terminals, China Merchants Port and Shenzhen Haixing (Mawan port), handled a record number of containers with rising trade increased cargo shipments in 2005, ranking it as the world's third-busiest port. Together, the logistics industry accounts for around 10.1% (178.27 billion RMB) of the city's nominal GDP in 2015, which was an increase of 9.4%.Shenzhen had prioritized the cultural industry in according to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and planning the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. On 7 December 2008, UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network, and awarded the Shenzhen the title of \"United Nations Design Capital.\" Altogether, the cultural industry in turn contributes to 5.8% (102.116 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015.\nIn addition to the four pillar industries that was listed by the municipal government, Shenzhen also has a relatively notable real-estate industry. The real-estate industry altogether contributes to 9.2% (162.777 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015, which was an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Real estate developers such as Vanke and China Resources Land are headquartered within the city.\nAs a SEZ, Shenzhen has established several industrial zones to encourage economic activities. The Shekou Industrial Zone was approved and established back in 31 January 1979 by the Central Committee of the CPC to assist in the \"Hong Kong-based\" economy of Shenzhen. In 1996, the State Council approved and established the 11.5 km2 (4.4 sq mi) Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Development Zone, helping to develop Shenzhen's high-tech industry in areas such as electronics and information technology. In accordance to the National Plan in 2001, the Shenzhen Software Park, integrated within the High-tech Industrial Development Zone, was established for software production and assist in the development of the city's software industry. On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\" to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of \u2018top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its \"12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city's scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation. In 2015, the tourism industry's total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1% increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28% (35 billion RMB or US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2% from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51% increase from 2010.\n\nShenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings. Most of the tourist attractions are part of Overseas Chinese Town (OCT), a colloquial name for parks owned by OCT Enterprises and is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. These include the Window of the World, the Splendid China Folk Village, Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37), OCT East, and OCT Harbour. Other theme parks include Shekou Sea World (\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e16\u754c), Xiaomeisha Sea World, and the now-closed Minsk World. Shenzhen also has a number of popular public parks and beaches, such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, Wutongshan Park, Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa'). The city is also home to tall buildings such as the Ping An Finance Centre, KK100, and the Shun Hing Square (also known as Di Wang Tower).Shenzhen's tourism industry is recently expanding under the \"13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. Part of the plan includes organizing the tourist industry within five brands: theme parks, retail, natural recreational areas, sports, and international gatherings, as well as speeding up construction of future tourist attractions and turning Shenzhen into a Chinese hub for sports.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail is an important pillar of Shenzhen's tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen's tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion), retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen's FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.\n\nHuaqiang North (\u534e\u5f3a\u5317) is one of Shenzhen's notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world. Luohu Commercial City, a commercial complex located adjacent to Shenzhen Railway Station, is noted for having a variety of products that ranges from electronics and counterfeit goods to tailored suits and curtains. In addition to Huaqiang North and Luohu Commercial City, Shenzhen has numerous shopping malls and commercial areas, including COCO Park and its branches COCO City and Longgang COCO Park, Uniworld (\u58f9\u65b9\u5929\u5730), Uniwalk (\u58f9\u65b9\u573a), and Coastal City(\u6d77\u5cb8\u57ce).\"Smart retail\", which uses technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in production, circulation, and sales of consumer goods, has been growing popular within enterprises in Shenzhen. Businesses in Shenzhen are encouraged to use the Internet to develop the consumer market and new retail projects would be assisted with the use of technology. In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of \"smart retail\", with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a \"new retail\" hub.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nShenzhen is considered as a major innovation hub of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Over the years it has become one of the most important research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centers in the country.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nShenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China, with a population of 12,528,300 in the city as of 2017. With a total area of 1,992 km\u00b2, Shenzhen has a population density of 6,889 inhabitants per square kilometre. The encompassing metropolitan area of the city was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 23.3 million. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world's largest urban area according to the World Bank, and has a population of over 108.5 million according to the 2015 census.Before Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. However, since become a SEZ, Shenzhen has become a hub for migrants searching for work and opportunities within the city.\n\n\n=== Historic ===\nThere had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is Mandarin that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.\nShenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of the world's factory.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment. The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012\u201313, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a yoy increase of 500,000.\n\n\n=== Other statistics ===\nAt present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.The population structure has great diversity, ranging from intellectuals with a high level of education to migrant workers with poor education. It was reported in June 2007 that more than 20 percent of China's PhD graduates had worked in Shenzhen. Shenzhen was also elected as one of the top 10 cities in China for expatriates. Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.\nAccording to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen. Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is restricted.\nMainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an \"Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao\". Shenzhen residents can have a special 1 year multiple-journey endorsement (but maximum 1 visit per week starting from April 13, 2015) This type of exit endorsement is only issued to people who have hukou in certain regions.(See Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau.)\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n==== Koreans ====\n\nAs of 2007 there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. As of 2014 Donghai had about 200 Korean families.South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, Korean International School in Shenzhen. As of 2007 there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. As of 2014 spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nPrior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Rd. was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century. Younger generations of the Cantonese communities now speak the more standard version. Today, some aboriginals of the Cantonese and Hakka speaking communities disperse into urban settlements (e.g. apartments and villas), but most of them are still clustering in their traditional urban and suburban villages.The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city's linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism is on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers begin to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, local languages such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew are still commonly spoken among locals. Hokkien and Xiang are also sometimes observed.According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant churches, Catholic churches, and mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37% of Shenzhen's residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26% were Buddhists, 18% Taoists, 2% Christians and 2% Muslims; 15% were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn general, Shenzhen is a relatively safe city. However, in districts such as Bao'an and Longgang, the number of robberies, extortion, kidnapping, and fraud exceeds the national average. In the central part of the Luohu District, especially in the neighborhoods around the Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal, and the Luohu Commercial City Shopping Center, pickpocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. In addition, Luohu is a major center for trade in counterfeit goods and abundant in its nightclubs, bars, and karaoke salons, which not only attracts Shenzhen residents, but also residents from neighboring Hong Kong, which may attract criminal elements. The Nanshan District has a large concentration of foreigners, and is known for its abundance of prostitutes and beggars. Along with local gangs in Shenzhen, there is a notable presence of triads: notably Wo Shing Wo, Big Circle Gang, Sun Yee On, 14K, and Shui Fong. The level of corruption in the government is usually high, as seen in the arrest of the then-mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng, for accepting bribes in June 2009, as well as arrests and convictions of Li Yugo, the former head of the largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a customs officer of the city, for the same reasons.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nShenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as \"the world leader completing new skyscrapers,\" as it managed to complete 14 skyscrapers that are above 200 meters in 2018, four more than Dubai, and keeping this title for three years. In addition, the city is home to the most number of skyscrapers above 200 meters than any other cities in the world, with 82 completed as of July 2019. The city is ranked the third in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 223 of them completed as of July 2019, after Hong Kong and New York City. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 60 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2019. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599-meter, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. The second-tallest building is the Kingkey 100, rising 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and containing 100 floors of office and hotel spaces. Shenzhen is also the home to the Shun Hing Square (Diwang Building), the tallest in Asia (if the antenna is taken into account) when it was built in 1996. Guomao Building was furthermore the tallest building in China when it was completed in 1985.In addition to the Shenzhen's modern skyscrapers, Shenzhen also has a significant number of historical buildings. Chiwan Fort is located on a small seaside hill in the Nanshan District. Today, what is left only represents a fragment of the large fortress, as it was partially destroyed by the British during the Opium Wars. Tianhou Temple in the Nanshan District is dedicated to the goddess Mazu, a tutelary deity for fishermen and sailors. According to legend, the temple was founded in 1410 by Admiral Zheng He after his fleet survived a strong storm in the Pearl River Delta. The temple is repeatedly rebuilt and repaired. Part of the temple was converted to a museum, but the rest still continues to function as a religious building. The tomb of the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Bing, is located in the Nanshan district. The modern tomb dates back to the end of the 19th century, when a Hong Kong clan announced one of the imperial tombs after a long search, though this is disputed by historians. The tomb was reconstructed at the beginning of the 20th century, but later it fell into neglect until it was restored again in the 1980s. Dapin Fortress is located in the eastern part of the city, in the same area. It was built in 1394 to protect the coast from pirates and in 1571 suffered a long siege of Japanese corsairs. It later turned into a typical town during the Qing Dynasty, and during the First Opium War, the fortress garrison participated in the fight against the British. Walls and gates, narrow streets, temples, and the residence of the commandant in the fortress are still preserved today.  There is an old fortified Hakka village in the Longgang District, whose the architectural features of which are complemented by the Hakka Culture Museum.\n\nThe old town of Nantou (or Xin'an), located in the Nanshan District, has several historical sites dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. From the 4th century, there existed a significant city, but today most of the old buildings have been replaced by modern buildings. However, there are still a few historical buildings, such as fortress walls and gates dating back to the Ming period, the Guandi Temple (Guan Yu), some military and civilian buildings (for example, the residence of officials, the shop, and the opium house), and several streets.\n\n\n=== Parks and beaches ===\n\nShenzhen offers free admission to over of its twenty public city parks such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, and Wutongshan Park. The Xianhu Botanical Garden (\u4ed9\u6e56; 'Fairy Lake'), founded in 1982, is spread around the lake of the same name in the Luohu District on an area of 590 hectares. On one of the hills of the garden is Hunfa Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Shenzhen, which was built in 1985 on the site of an older shrine. Around the lake are a pagoda, tea houses, pavilions, the Museum of Paleontology, a garden of medicinal plants and an azalea garden. Wutongshan National Park (\u68a7\u6850\u5c71) is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station. Lianhuashan Park (\u83b2\u82b1\u5c71; Lotus Hill) is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of the mountain is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. The Shenzhen Garden and Flower Exposition Center, established in the Futian District in 2004 for the International Garden Exhibition, has many gardens of various styles, artificial ponds and waterfalls, a pagoda, pavilions, and statues. The Shenzhen Bay Park opened in 2011 which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay. The Shenzhen Safari Park in the Nanshan District combines a zoo and a large zoological center on a territory of 120 hectares. Xili Lake Resort (\u897f\u4e3d\u6e56), located in the Nanshan District, has a park with springs and waterfalls stretching around the lake, surrounded by a canopy, and a pagoda and a pavilion located on the top of Xili Mountain. Zhongshan Park (\u4e2d\u5c71), located in the Nanshan District, is the city's oldest park. It has several artificial lakes and ponds, an old city wall dating back to the 14th century, and many sculptures and monuments, including one of Sun Yat-sen. The Yangtai Mountain Forest Park is located around the 500-meter Yangtai Mountain (\u7f8a\u53f0\u5c71) in the Bao'an District. Nearby the mountain is Shiyan Lake (\u77f3\u5ca9\u6e56), which became a popular place of Xin'an County in the 16th century. It is famous for its several indoor and outdoor pools with hot thermal waters.Shenzhen has several beaches: Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa') in the Yantian District, and Jinshawan (\u91d1\u6c99\u6e7e; 'golden sands bay'), Nan'ao (\u5357\u6fb3; 'southern inlet'), and Xichong (\u897f\u51b2) in Dapeng Peninsula (in the vicinity of Dapeng New District, which is administered by the Longgang District).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBefore the 1980s, Shenzhen's education system was primarily based on primary and limited secondary schooling, with no residents admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. Shenzhen started implementing policies that will help develop a more high-quality education system, borrowing teachers from the best schools in the country with promises of higher pay and benefits. In addition, the city started building new schools and renovating the infrastructure of its existing schools to give teachers a more comfortable environment to teach.In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen's first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China's top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the innovative Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Institute of Technology. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.The 9-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. Secondary schools such as Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School, all of which have an on-line rate of over 90%, are dubbed as \"Shenzhen's four famous schools.\" As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools.According to Laurie Chen of the South China Morning Post, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou's count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen's by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nShenzhen is the second largest transportation hub in Guangdong and South China, trailing behind the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shenzhen has a developed extensive public transportation system, covering rapid transit, buses and taxis, most of which can be accessed by either using a Shenzhen Tong card or using QR codes generated by WeChat mini programs.\nRegarding air transport, Shenzhen is served by its own Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and the neighboring Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). Located 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the center of the city, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport serves as the main hub for passenger airlines Shenzhen Airlines and Donghai Airlines and a main hub for cargo airlines Jade Cargo International, SF Airlines, and UPS Airlines. Together, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport handled 49,348,950 passengers, 355,907 aircraft, and 1,218,502.2 cargo in 2018, making it the 5th busiest airport in China in terms of passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport in the country in terms of aircraft and cargo traffic. In addition to flying through Bao'an International Airport, ticketed passengers can also take ferries from the Shekou Cruise Centre and the Fuyong Ferry Terminal to the Skypier at Hong Kong International Airport. There are also coach bus services connecting Shenzhen with HKIA.\nThe Shenzhen Metro serves as the city's rapid transit system. The extension opened on 8 December 2019 put the network at 303.4 kilometres (188.5 miles) of trackage operating on 8 lines with 215 stations. By 2030 the network is planned to be 8 express and 24 non-express lines totalling 1142 kilometres of trackage. The average daily metro ridership in 2016 is 3.54 million passengers, which accounts for a third of public transportation users in the city. The metro also operates a tram system in the Longhua District.\n\nShenzhen is served by seven inter-city railway stations: Futian, Guangmingcheng, Pingshan, Shenzhen (also known as Luohu Railway Station) Shenzhen East, Shenzhen North, and Shenzhen West. High-speed rail (HSR) lines that go through the city are the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, and the Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen railway (forms part of the Hangzhou\u2013Fuzhou\u2013Shenzhen passenger railway). Non-HSR lines that go through Shenzhen are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway (forms part of the Kowloon\u2013Canton railway) and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.\nAs of August 2019, the city's bus system encompasses over 900 lines, with a total of over 16,000 electric vehicles, the largest of its kind in the world. The system is operated by multiple companies. As at January 2019 conversion of Shenzhen's taxi fleet to electric vehicles reached 99%. Electric taxis have a blue and white colour scheme. Petroleum fuelled taxis are coloured either green or red.Shenzhen serves as a fabric to China's expressway system. Expressways within the city include the Meiguan Expressway (part of the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway), the Jihe Expressway (part of the G15 Shenhai Expressway), the Yanba Expressway (part of the S30 Huishen Costal Expressway), the S28 Shuiguan Expressway, the Yanpai Expressway (part of the G25 Changshen Expressway and the S27 Renshen Expressway), and the S33 Nanguang Expressway. In response to being rejected from being a part of the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, Shenzhen is constructing a bridge across the Pearl River Delta to connect the city of Zhongshan.Private car ownership has been on the rise in Shenzhen, with the city having over 3.14 million cars in 2014. In response, the city imposed limits on car purchases to reduce traffic and pollution. The purchase of electric cars will be determined by a lottery, while traditional cars will be determined both a lottery and a bidding process. In addition, the city banned passenger vehicles with license plates issued in other places from four of Shenzhen's main districts during peak times on working days as of 29 December 2014.\n\nShenzhen is connected with Hong Kong (city and airport), Zhuhai and Macau through ferries that leave from and arrive at the Shekou Cruise Center. The Fuyong Passenger Terminal in the Bao'an District provide services to and from Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) and Macau (Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal). The Port of Shenzhen is the third busiest container port in the world, handling 27.7 million TEUs in 2018.Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has the largest number of entry and exit ports, the largest number of entry and exit personnel, and the largest traffic volume in China. Shenzhen is busiest in China when it comes to border crossings, with people entering and exiting the country through the city and Hong Kong reaching 239 million in 2015. In the same year, a total of 15.5 million vehicles crossed the border in Shenzhen, a 0.4% increase of last year.  Border crossing ports include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, and Luohu Port. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAs Shenzhen is located in Guangdong, the city historically has a Cantonese culture before its transition to a SEZ. Migrants coming to the city to find work and opportunities have turned Shenzhen into a cultural melting pot. Despite this, the municipal government and some of the residents living in Shenzhen, including those who are not from Guangdong, have invested in keeping and reflecting off the city's Cantonese heritage. Shenzhen has presented itself as a city of opportunity for young people in China. The competitive culture that the city promotes among the youth have resulted in the term \"Shenzhen speed,\" which describes a period of constant competition, quick changes, and high-efficiency.In 2003, the municipal government announced plans to turned Shenzhen into a cultural city by promoting design, animation, and library construction. The municipal government also intends to develop the city's cultural industry in accordance to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. Shenzhen's cultural industry specializes in being one of the largest handicraft manufacturers in China, and is also an industry center for oil painting in bases such as Dafen Village. Shenzhen also hosts the Shenzhen International Cultural Fair which specializes as an expo for the world's cultural industries, with the first expo being on November 2004. As a result of these developments, Shenzhen was awarded by UNESCO the title of \"United Nations Design Capital\" and was accepted entry into the Creative Cities Network on 7 December 2008.\n\nAs part of turning Shenzhen into a cultural city, the municipal government established the \"Library City\" (\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e4b\u57ce) concept in 2003. The plan would create a library network within the city through library construction, service improvement, and create a comfortable reading environment.  By the end of 2015, Shenzhen has 620 public libraries, including 3 city-level public libraries, 8 district-level public libraries, and 609 grassroots libraries.  Notable libraries include the Shenzhen Library and the Shenzhen Children's Library. Shenzhen also has bookstores, with the most notable being Shenzhen Book City in the Futian District. With an operating area of 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft), it claimed to be the largest bookstore of Asia at the time of its opening. Shenzhen has a number of museums and art galleries, such as the Shenzhen Museum, the Shenzhen Art Museum, the Shekou Maritime Museum, the Longgang Museum of Hakka Culture, the Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art, and the He Xiangning Art Museum. Shenzhen also has a few theaters, notably the Shenzhen Concert Hall, the Shenzhen Grand Theater, and the Shenzhen Poly Theater.\n\nAs with Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province, the main cuisine of Shenzhen is Cantonese. However, due to the recent growth of migrants to the city, Shenzhen also hosts a diverse array of cuisines, from Chinese cuisines such as Chaozhou cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hu Cuisine, and Xiang Cuisine, as well as foreign cuisines such as Korean, Japanese, French, and American. The Yantian District is known for its Chaozhou-based and Hakka-based seafood, with restaurants lined up along the coastline.  Some recreational areas in Shenzhen such as Xianhu Botanical Garden, Donghu Park, and Xiaomeisha, host barbecues where visitors bring their own food.  Street food such as Xinjiang lamb skewers, Northern Chinese pancakes, and black sesame soups, can be found in Xijie Street and the urban village of Baishizhou. Shenzhen also has its own tea culture. In regards to food chains, first McDonald's restaurant in mainland China opened for business in Shenzhen on 8 October 1990, providing the city American fast food. Shenzhen is home to the HeyTea chain of tea shops, which provides a variety of cheese and fruit teas and is popular among social media.Shenzhen has a prominent nightlife culture, with most of the activity centered in the entertainment complexes of COCO Park and Shekou, with the former being referred by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) as \"Shenzhen's answer to Lan Kwai Fong.\" There are many bars and clubs in the city, mostly unregulated, that stay open till the morning.  Tunnel raves, referred by the SCMP as \"a Shenzhen nightlife staple\", have earned a reputation in the world, though they are often cracked down by police.  Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui (\u6c99\u5634\u6751) in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShenzhen is the home to professional football team Shenzhen F.C., which participates in both China League One and the Chinese Super League. Another local football team, Shenzhen Ledman F.C., was once a part of China League Two until the club was disbanded in 2018. Shenzhen's top-tier basketball team, the Shenzhen Aviators, plays in the Southern Division of the Chinese Basketball Association. Shenzhen F.C. and the Shenzhen Aviators both are tenants of the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre.\nShenzhen Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that hosts many events. The stadium is located in Futian District and has a capacity of 32,500. It was built in June 1993, at a cost of 141 million RMB. The 26th Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen in August 2011. Shenzhen has constructed the sports venues for this first major sporting event in the city.Shenzhen Dayun Arena is a multipurpose arena.  It was completed in 2011 for the 2011 Summer Universiade.  It is used for the basketball, ice hockey and gymnastics events.  The arena is the home of the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\nShenzhen is also a popular destination for skateboarders from all over the world, due to the architecture of the city and its lax skate laws.The Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre was one of the venues at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 2019 to 2028 Shenzhen is hosting the WTA Finals, a major annual professional tennis tournament for the world's most top-ranked female players.\n\n\n== Relationship with Hong Kong ==\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below. Except where noted the statistics are taken from sections of the Hong Kong Government website.As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 teus/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary, while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.\n\nTrade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333 billion of imports of which US$298 billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card (Home Return Permit) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of Zhongshan on the Western side: the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge.\n\n\n==== Qianhai ====\n\nQianhai, which means foresea in Chinese language, formally known as the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone, is \"a useful exploration for China to create a new opening up layout with a more open economic system.\" A 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi) area located in western Shenzhen, Qianhai lies at the heart of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to Shenzhen international airport. Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta. With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from HSBC, \"This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nShenzhen has an advanced public media network, boasting one radio station, two TV stations, three broadcasting and TV centers, 19 cable broadcasting and TV sub-stations. In Shenzhen, there are 14 newspapers, one comprehensive publishing house, three video-audio products publishing houses, 88 bureaus of inland and Hong Kong media organizations, 40 periodicals, and about 200 kinds of in-house publications of which the majority belong to enterprises. The most prominent media companies in Shenzhen are the Shenzhen Media Group, the Shenzhen Press Group, China Entertainment Television (CETV), and Phoenix Television branch iFeng.Shenzhen News (\u6df1\u5733\u665a\u62a5, sznews.com) is a Chinese-language newspaper owned by the Shenzhen Press Group that serves as Shenzhen's main online new source. Shenzhen Daily is an English-language news outlet for Shenzhen. It also covers local, national and international news. That's Shenzhen is the Shenzhen edition of That's PRD, an English-language media company with an online, print and social footprint. That's Shenzhen covers news, arts, lifestyle and events in the city. ShekouDaily.com is an online media outlet providing news and resources that focus on the Shekou sub-district in Nanshan District of Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nShenzhen has been very active in cultivating sister city relationships. In October 1989, Shenzhen Mayor Li Hao and a delegation travelled to Houston to attend the signing ceremony establishing a sister city relationship between Houston and Shenzhen. Houston became the first sister city of Shenzhen. Up to 2015, Shenzhen has established sister city relationship with 25 cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Other twinnings ===\nThe Shenzhen Port is twinned and has collaboration agreements with:\n\n The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, June 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Shenzhen-related articles\nAdministrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\nEconomy of China\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPearl River (China)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBach, Jonathan (August 2010). \"\"THEY COME IN PEASANTS AND LEAVE CITIZENS\": Urban Villages and the Making of Shenzhen, China\".

        "wiki": "Shenzhen (; Chinese: \u6df1\u5733; Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0282\u0259\u0301n.\u0288\u0282\u0259\u0302n] (listen)) is a major sub-provincial city on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People's Republic of China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the northeast and Dongguan to the northwest, and shares maritime boundaries with Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai to the west and southwest across the estuary.\nShenzhen's cityscape results from its vibrant economy\u2014made possible by rapid foreign investment following the institution of the policy of \"reform and opening-up\" in 1979. The city is a leading global technology hub, dubbed by media China's Silicon Valley. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s, and has been ranked second on the list \"top 10 cities to visit in 2019\" by Lonely Planet.Shenzhen, which roughly follows the administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, officially became a city in 1979, taking its name from the former county town, whose train station was the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between Canton and Kowloon. In 1980, Shenzhen was established as China's first special economic zone. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000, but local police and authorities estimate the population at about 20 million, due to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents.Shenzhen hosts the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of numerous multinational companies such as JXD, Vanke, Hytera, CIMC, SF Express, Shenzhen Airlines, Nepstar, Hasee, Ping An Bank, Ping An Insurance, China Merchants Bank, Evergrande Group, Tencent, ZTE, OnePlus, Huawei, DJI and BYD. Shenzhen ranks 9th in the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index. It has the third busiest container port in the world.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe earliest known recorded mention of the name zhen could date from 1410, during the Ming Dynasty. Locals call the drains in paddy fields \"zhen\" (Chinese: \u5733; lit.: 'ditch, drain'). Shenzhen was named after a deep (Chinese: \u6df1; lit.: 'deep') drain that was located within the area.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory to Ming era ===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area on which Shenzhen was established dates back during the mid-Neolithic period. Since then, this area has seen human activity from more than 6,700 years ago, with Shenzhen's historic counties first established 1,700 years ago, and the historic towns of Nantou and Dapeng, which was built on the area that is now Shenzhen, established more than 600 years ago. The Hakka people also have a history in Shenzhen since 300 years ago when they first immigrated.\nIn 214 BC, when Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China under the Qin Dynasty, the area went under the jurisdiction of the established Nanhai County, one of three counties that were set up in Lingnan, and was assimilated into Zhongyuan culture. In 331 AD, the Eastern Jin administration split up Nanhai County into two counties: Dongguan County in the north and Bao'an County in the south, with both under the administration of Dongguan Prefecture. In 590, the Sui administration merged Dongguan County and Bao'an County back into Nanhai County, and set the local government in the town of Nantou, though this was reversed by the Tang administration in 757.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Nantou and the surrounding area became an important trade hub for salt and spices in the South China Sea. The area then became known for producing pearls during the Yuan Dynasty. In the early Ming era, Chinese sailors of a fleet would go to a Mazu temple in Chiwan (in present-day Nanshan District) to pray as they go to Nanyang (Southeast Asia). The Battle of Tunmen, when the Ming won a naval battle against invading Portuguese, was fought south of Nantou. In 1573, the Ming administration dissolved Bao'an County to establish Xin'an County, based in Nantou, which had authority over regions that would be Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Xin'an County's economy primarily was based on the production and trade of salt, tea, spices, and rice.\n\n\n=== Qing-era to 1940s ===\nTo prevent a rebellion from Ming loyalists under Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, on the Chinese coast, the recently established Qing administration re-organized coastal provinces. As a result, Xin'an County lost two-thirds of its territory to the neighboring Dongguan County and was later incorporated into Dongguan in 1669, though Xin'an was restored about 15 years later, in 1684. As of 1688, there were 28 towns in Xin'an County, of which one of the towns is named Shenzhen. When the Qing lost to the United Kingdom in both Opium Wars in 1842 and 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island were ceded from Xin'an to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and the Convention of Peking. On 21 April 1898, the Qing government signed a \"Special Article for the Exhibition of Hong Kong's Borders\" with the United Kingdom, and leased the New Territories from Xin'an to the United Kingdom for 99 years. Shenzhen was occupied by the British under Henry Arthur Blake, the then-governor of Hong Kong for half-a-year in 1899. From the 3,076 square kilometres (1,188 sq mi) of territory that Xin'an held before the treaties, 1,055.61 square kilometres (407.57 sq mi) of the county's land was ceded to the British.\n\nIn response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Xin'an residents rebelled against the local Qing administration and successfully overthrew them. In the same year the Chinese section of the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway (KCR) was opened to the public, and the last stop of the Chinese side, named Shenzhen Railway Station at the town of Shenzhen, which had opened recently, helped the town's economy and opened Shenzhen up to the world. In 1913, the Republic of China administration renamed Xin'an County back to Bao'an County to prevent confusion from another county of the same name in Henan Province. During the Canton\u2013Hong Kong strike, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions set up a reception station for strike workers in Hong Kong in Shenzhen. Strike workers were also given pickets and armored vehicles by the strike committee to create a blockade around Hong Kong. In 1931, Chen Jitang and his family established several casinos in Shenzhen, the largest of which being Shumchun Casino. While only in operation until 1936, they significantly increased KCR's passenger traffic to and from Shenzhen.\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and Nantou, forcing the Bao'an County government to relocate to the neighboring Dongguan County. In 1941, the Japanese army tried to cross into Hong Kong through the Lo Wu Bridge in Shenzhen, though this was detonated by the British, preventing the Japanese from entering Hong Kong. When Japan surrendered on May 1945, the Bao'an County government moved back to Nantou. \n\n\n=== 1950s to 1970s ===\nIn 1953, four years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Bao'an County government decided to move to Shenzhen, since the city was closer to the KCR and had a larger economy than Nantou. From the 1950s to the end of the 1970s, Shenzhen and the rest of Bao'an County oversaw a huge influx of refugees trying to escape to Hong Kong from the upheavals that were occurring in mainland China, and a range from 100,000 to 560,000 refugees resided in the county.\nIn January 1978, a Central Inspection Team sent by the State Council investigated and established the issue of creating a foreign trade port in Bao'an County. In May, the investigation team wrote the \"Hong Kong and Macao Economic Investigation Report\" and proposed to turn Bao'an County and Zhuhai into commodity export bases. In August 1978, the Huiyang District Committee reported to the Provincial Committee on the \"Report on the Request for the Change of Bao'an County to Shenzhen\". On 18 October, the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to change Bao'an County into Bao'an City and to turn it into a medium-level prefecture-level city with a foreign trade base. The Huiyang District Committee and the Bao'an County Committee, however, defended the change to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen, claiming that people in the world know more about Shenzhen and its port than they know about Bao'an County.\nOn 23 January 1979, the Guangdong provincial administration and the district of Huiyang announced their proposal to rename Bao'an County to Shenzhen and was approved and put into effect by the State Council on March 5 of that year. Also, the city would establish six districts: Luohu, Nantou, Songgang, Longhua, Longgang and Kuiyong. On 31 January 1979, the Central Committee of the Communist Party approved a plan to establish the Shekou Industrial Zone in Shenzhen with the purpose \"to lead domestic, overseas, and diversified operations, industrial and commercial integration, and trading\" based on the systems of that of Hong Kong and Macau. The Shekou Industrial Zone project was led by Hong Kong-based China Merchants Group under Yuan Geng's leadership and was to become the first export processing industrial zone in mainland China.\nAt the beginning of April 1979, the Standing Committee of Guangdong Province discussed and proposed to the Central Committee to set up a \"trade cooperation zone\" in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In the same month, the Central Working Conference decided on the \"Regulations on Vigorously Developing Foreign Trade to Increase Foreign Exchange Income\" and agreed to pilot the first special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen. In November, Shenzhen was elevated to the status of prefecture-level city at the regional level by the Guangdong provincial administration.\n\n\n=== Special Economic Zone (1980s\u2013present) ===\n\nIn May 1980, the Central Committee designated Shenzhen as an SEZ, which was promoted by then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and created to be an experimental ground for the practice of market capitalism within a community guided by the ideals of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\". On 26 August, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the \"Regulations of the Guangdong Special Economic Zone.\" Under these regulations, Shenzhen formulated a series of preferential policies to attract foreign investment, including business autonomy, taxation, land use, foreign exchange management, product sales, and entry and exit management. Through the processing of incoming materials, compensation trade, joint ventures, cooperative operations, sole proprietorship, and leasing, the city has attracted a large amount of foreign investment and helped popularize and enable rapid development of the SEZ concept.\n\nIn March 1981, Shenzhen was promoted to a sub-provincial city. There were plans for Shenzhen to develop its currency, but the plans were shelved due to the risk and the disagreement that a country should not be operating with two currencies. To enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). In November 1988, Shenzhen became a separate city (\u8ba1\u5212\u5355\u5217\u5e02), meaning that the city can implement policies that are different from those in the national plan, and was given the right of provincial-level economic administration.In December 1990, under the authority of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was established to provide a platform for centralized securities trading. In February 1992, the Standing Committee of the NPC granted the government of Shenzhen the power to make local laws and regulations. In 1996 and early 1997, the Shenzhen Guesthouse Hotel in Shenzhen was home to the Provisional Legislative Council and Provisional Executive Council of Hong Kong in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.By 2001, as a result of Shenzhen's increasing economic prospects, increasing numbers of migrants from mainland China chose to go to Shenzhen and stay there instead of trying to illegally cross into Hong Kong. There were 9,000 captured border-crossers in 2000, while the same figure was 16,000 in 1991. Around the same time, Shenzhen hosted the second Senior Officials' Meeting of APEC China 2001 on 26 May 2001 in its southern manufacturing center and port. In May 2008, the State Council approved the Shenzhen SEZ to promote Shenzhen's administrative management system, economic system, social field, independent innovation system and mechanism, system and mechanism for opening up and regional cooperation, and resource conservation and environmental friendliness.On 1 July 2010, the State Council dissolved the \"second line,\" and expanded the Shenzhen SEZ to include all districts, a five-fold increase over its pre-expansion size. On 26 August 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen SEZ, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone.\" In August 2011, the city hosted the 26th Universiade, an international multi-sport event organized for university athletes. In April 2015, the Shekou Industrial Zone and the Qianhai Zone were integrated within the newly-established Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.On 18 August 2019, the central government in Beijing unveiled reform plans covering economical, social, and political sectors of Shenzhen, intending to have the SEZ be a model city for others in China to follow.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShenzhen is located within the Pearl River Delta, bordering Hong Kong to the south, Huizhou to the north and northeast, Dongguan to the north and northwest. Lingdingyang and Pearl River to the west and Mirs Bay to the east and roughly 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. As of the end of 2017, the resident population of Shenzhen was 12,528,300, of which the registered population was 4,472,200, the actual administrative population was over 20 million. It makes up part of the Pearl River Delta built-up area with 44,738,513 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities (including Macau). The city is elongated measuring 81.4 kilometers from east to west while the shortest section from north to south is 10.8 kilometers.\nOver 160 rivers or channels flow through Shenzhen. There are 24 reservoirs within the city limits with a total capacity of 525 million tonnes. Notable rivers in Shenzhen include the Shenzhen River, Maozhou River and Longgang River.Shenzhen is surrounded by many islands. Most of them fall under the territory of neighbouring areas such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Huiyang District, Huizhou. But there are several islands under Shenzhen's jurisdiction, such as Nei Lingding Island, Dachan Island (Tai Shan Island), Xiaochan Island, Mazhou, Laishizhou, Zhouzai and Zhouzaitou. (See List of islands in Shenzhen)\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAlthough Shenzhen is situated about a degree south of the Tropic of Cancer, due to the Siberian anticyclone it has a warm, monsoon-influenced, humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa). Winters are mild and relatively dry, due in part to the influence of the South China Sea, and frost is very rare; it begins dry but becomes progressively more humid and overcast. However, fog is most frequent in winter and spring, with 106 days per year reporting some fog. Early spring is the cloudiest time of year, and rainfall begins to dramatically increase in April; the rainy season lasts until late September to early October. The monsoon reaches its peak intensity in the summer months, when the city also experiences very humid, and hot, but moderated, conditions; there are only 2.4 days of 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F)+ temperatures. The region is prone to torrential rain as well, with 9.7 days that have 50 mm (1.97 in) or more of rain, and 2.2 days of at least 100 mm (3.94 in). The latter portion of autumn is dry. The annual precipitation averages at around 1,970 mm (78 in), some of which is delivered in typhoons that strike from the east during summer and early autumn. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0.2 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) on 11 February 1957 to 38.7 \u00b0C (102 \u00b0F) on 10 July 1980.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Shenzhen is structured in a parallel party-government system, in which the Party Committee Secretary, officially termed the Communist Party of China Shenzhen Municipal Committee Secretary (currently Wang Weizhong), outranks the Mayor (currently Chen Rugui). The party's standing committee acts as the top policy formulation body, and is typically composed of 11 members.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nShenzhen has direct jurisdiction over nine administrative Districts and one New District:\n\nSpecial Economic Zone Border\nTo enforce law and order in the city, the Shenzhen government erected barbed wire and checkpoints between the land borders of the main sections of the SEZ and the SEZ outskirts, as well as the rest of China, in 1983, which was known as the second line (Chinese: \u4e8c\u7ebf\u5173). Initially, the border control was relatively strict, requiring non-Shenzhen citizens to obtain special permissions for entering. Over the years, border controls have gradually weakened, and permission requirement has been abandoned.\nOn 1 July 2010, the original SEZ border control was cancelled, and the Shenzhen SEZ was expanded to the whole city. The area of Shenzhen SEZ thus increased from 396 square kilometres (153 sq mi) to 1,953 square kilometres (754 sq mi). Since June 2015 the existing unused border structures have been demolished and are being transformed into urban greenspaces and parks. On 15 January 2018, the State Council approved the removal of the barbed wire fence set up to mark the boundary of the SEZ. Although the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone have been extended to cover the whole of Shenzhen, colloquially Shenzhen is still said to be separated into two areas, with the original four districts comprising the SEZ before 2010 as \"simplified Chinese: \u5173\u5185; traditional Chinese: \u95dc\u5167; pinyin: gu\u0101n n\u00e8i; Jyutping: gwaan1 noi6; lit.: 'within the border') and the rest known as \"\u5173\u5916; \u95dc\u5916; gu\u0101n w\u00e0i; gwaan1 ngoi6; 'outside of the border').\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nShenzhen was the first of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to be established by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As a SEZ, Shenzhen is given the privilege to embrace market capitalism policies under the guise of \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,\" unlike other cities in Mainland China which is based on a planned economy. As of 2018, Shenzhen has a nominal GDP of 2.42 trillion RMB (HK$2.87 trillion), which recently had surpassed neighboring Hong Kong's GDP of HK$2.85 trillion and Guangzhou's GDP of 2.29 trillion RMB (HK$2.68 trillion), making the economic output of Shenzhen the third largest out of Chinese cities, trailing behind Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, Shenzhen's GDP growth between 2016 and 2017 of 8.8% surpassed that of Hong Kong and Singapore, with 3.7% and 2.5% respectively. With a market capitalization of US$2.5 trillion as of 30 November 2018, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) is the 8th largest exchange in the world.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nShenzhen's industry is described by its Municipal Bureau of Statistics to be upheld by its four-pillar industries: high-tech, finance, logistics, and culture. Shenzhen is primarily known for its high-tech industry, which has a value of 585.491 billion RMB (US$82.9 billion) in 2015, a 13% increase compared to last year. Out of the nominal GDP of 1,750.299 billion RMB in 2015, the high-tech industry comprises 33.4% of this amount. Shenzhen is home to a number of prominent tech firms, such as telecommunications and electronics corporation Huawei, internet giant and holding conglomerate Tencent, drone-maker DJI, and telecommunications company ZTE. Shenzhen annually holds the China International High-tech Achievements Fair, which showcases high-tech products and provides for dialogue and investment for high-tech. As a result, Shenzhen is dubbed by media outlets as \"China's Silicon Valley\" or the \"Silicon Valley of Hardware\" for the world.\nIn addition to its numerous high-tech companies, Shenzhen is also home to a number of large financial institutions, such as China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance and its subsidiary Ping An Bank. Since the city's establishment as a SEZ, a number of foreign banks had established offices in the city, including Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia. In total, the financial industry accounts for 14.5% of the city's nominal GDP in 2015 (254.282 billion RMB), which was a 15.9% increase over the previous year. By the end of 2016, the total assets of the financial industry amounted to 12.7 trillion RMB (banking industry assets were 7.85 trillion RMB, security companies assets were 1.25 trillion RMB, and insurance industry assets were 3.6 trillion RMB), making Shenzhen's financial industry the third largest in China. In addition, Shenzhen is one of the world's top ten financial centers as of 2019, jumping five places to ninth place as determined by \"variety of areas of competitiveness, including business environment, human capital, infrastructure, financial sector development and reputation.\"Addressing the logistics industry, courier SF Express and shipping company China International Marine Containers (CIMC) have their headquarters in Shenzhen.  The Port of Shenzhen, composed of Yantian International Container Terminals, Chiwan Container Terminals, Shekou Container Terminals, China Merchants Port and Shenzhen Haixing (Mawan port), handled a record number of containers with rising trade increased cargo shipments in 2005, ranking it as the world's third-busiest port. Together, the logistics industry accounts for around 10.1% (178.27 billion RMB) of the city's nominal GDP in 2015, which was an increase of 9.4%.Shenzhen had prioritized the cultural industry in according to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and planning the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. On 7 December 2008, UNESCO approved Shenzhen's entrance into the Creative Cities Network, and awarded the Shenzhen the title of \"United Nations Design Capital.\" Altogether, the cultural industry in turn contributes to 5.8% (102.116 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015.\nIn addition to the four pillar industries that was listed by the municipal government, Shenzhen also has a relatively notable real-estate industry. The real-estate industry altogether contributes to 9.2% (162.777 billion RMB) of Shenzhen's economy in 2015, which was an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Real estate developers such as Vanke and China Resources Land are headquartered within the city.\nAs a SEZ, Shenzhen has established several industrial zones to encourage economic activities. The Shekou Industrial Zone was approved and established back in 31 January 1979 by the Central Committee of the CPC to assist in the \"Hong Kong-based\" economy of Shenzhen. In 1996, the State Council approved and established the 11.5 km2 (4.4 sq mi) Shenzhen High-tech Industrial Development Zone, helping to develop Shenzhen's high-tech industry in areas such as electronics and information technology. In accordance to the National Plan in 2001, the Shenzhen Software Park, integrated within the High-tech Industrial Development Zone, was established for software production and assist in the development of the city's software industry. On 26 August 2010, the State Council approved the \"Overall Development Plan for Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\" to solidify ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is gradually growing as an important industry for Shenzhen. Shenzhen has been ranked second on the list of \u2018top 10 cities to visit in 2019' by Lonely Planet. The Shenzhen administration in its \"12th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" had focused on turning the city into an international tourist hub, with emphasis on the city's scientific, fashion, and industrial elements. The Shenzhen tourist industry is claimed by the local administration in having a strong development advantage, due to the city being one of the tier-one cities in China, as well as being known for its coastal resources, climate environment, capitalist economy, and technological innovation. In 2015, the tourism industry's total revenue was 124.48 billion RMB (US$17.6 billion), a 98.1% increase from 2010. Out of the total revenue, 28% (35 billion RMB or US$4.968 billion) came from international tourists, an increase of 56.2% from 2010. In addition, in that year, Shenzhen received 11.63 million tourists, a 51% increase from 2010.\n\nShenzhen has numerous tourist destinations, ranging from recreational areas such as theme parks and public parks to tall buildings. Most of the tourist attractions are part of Overseas Chinese Town (OCT), a colloquial name for parks owned by OCT Enterprises and is classified as an AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration. These include the Window of the World, the Splendid China Folk Village, Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37), OCT East, and OCT Harbour. Other theme parks include Shekou Sea World (\u6d77\u4e0a\u4e16\u754c), Xiaomeisha Sea World, and the now-closed Minsk World. Shenzhen also has a number of popular public parks and beaches, such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, Wutongshan Park, Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa'). The city is also home to tall buildings such as the Ping An Finance Centre, KK100, and the Shun Hing Square (also known as Di Wang Tower).Shenzhen's tourism industry is recently expanding under the \"13th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development of Shenzhen\" as promoted under the Shenzhen local government. In this plan, the tourist industry plans to exceed 200 billion RMB and receive 150 million domestic and foreign tourists by 2020. Part of the plan includes organizing the tourist industry within five brands: theme parks, retail, natural recreational areas, sports, and international gatherings, as well as speeding up construction of future tourist attractions and turning Shenzhen into a Chinese hub for sports.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\n\nRetail is an important pillar of Shenzhen's tertiary sector. Out of the added value of Shenzhen's tertiary sector of 1.42 trillion RMB (US$201 billion), retail contributed 43% (616.89 billion RMB) of this amount, a 7.6 percent increase compared to last year (601.62 billion RMB). In addition, 10.9% of Shenzhen's FDI is directed towards the wholesale and retail sector.\n\nHuaqiang North (\u534e\u5f3a\u5317) is one of Shenzhen's notable retail areas, being known for having one of the largest electronics markets in the world. Luohu Commercial City, a commercial complex located adjacent to Shenzhen Railway Station, is noted for having a variety of products that ranges from electronics and counterfeit goods to tailored suits and curtains. In addition to Huaqiang North and Luohu Commercial City, Shenzhen has numerous shopping malls and commercial areas, including COCO Park and its branches COCO City and Longgang COCO Park, Uniworld (\u58f9\u65b9\u5929\u5730), Uniwalk (\u58f9\u65b9\u573a), and Coastal City(\u6d77\u5cb8\u57ce).\"Smart retail\", which uses technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in production, circulation, and sales of consumer goods, has been growing popular within enterprises in Shenzhen. Businesses in Shenzhen are encouraged to use the Internet to develop the consumer market and new retail projects would be assisted with the use of technology. In addition, the Shenzhen administration is setting up a new retail industry development fund to promote the use of \"smart retail\", with the intention of stimulating the economy of Shenzhen and to turn the city into a \"new retail\" hub.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nShenzhen is considered as a major innovation hub of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Over the years it has become one of the most important research and development (R&D) and manufacturing centers in the country.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nShenzhen is the fifth most populous city proper in China, with a population of 12,528,300 in the city as of 2017. With a total area of 1,992 km\u00b2, Shenzhen has a population density of 6,889 inhabitants per square kilometre. The encompassing metropolitan area of the city was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 23.3 million. Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region (covering cities such as Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Huizhou, Hong Kong, and Macau), the world's largest urban area according to the World Bank, and has a population of over 108.5 million according to the 2015 census.Before Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in 1980, the area was composed mainly of Hakka and Cantonese people. However, since become a SEZ, Shenzhen has become a hub for migrants searching for work and opportunities within the city.\n\n\n=== Historic ===\nThere had been migration into southern Guangdong province and what is now Shenzhen since the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) but the numbers increased dramatically since Shenzhen was established in the 1980s. In Guangdong province, it is the only city where the local languages (Cantonese, Shenzhen-Hakka and Teochew) is not the main language; it is Mandarin that is mostly spoken, with migrants/immigrants from all over China.\nShenzhen has seen its population and activity develop rapidly since the establishment of the SEZ as a magnet for migrants, beginning with blue collar or labor-intensive workers, giving the city the moniker of the world's factory.  Shenzhen had an official population of over 10 million during the 2011 census. However, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city, some estimates put Shenzhen's actual population at around 20 million inside the administrative area given at any specific moment. The population growth of Shenzhen follows large scale trends; around 2012\u201313, the city's estimated growth slowed down to less than 1 percent due to rising migrant labor costs, migrant worker targeted reforms, and moving of factories out to periphery and neighboring Dongguan. By 2015, the high tech economy began to gradually replace the labor-intensive industries as the city gradually became a magnet for a new generation of migrants, this time educated, white collar workers. Migration into Shenzhen was further promoted by hard population caps imposed on other Tier I cities like Beijing and Shanghai, previously the top destinations for white collar workers. By the end of 2018, the official registered population had been estimated as just over 13 million a yoy increase of 500,000.\n\n\n=== Other statistics ===\nAt present, the average age in Shenzhen is less than 30. The age range is as follows: 8.49% between the age of 0 and 14, 88.41% between the age of 15 and 59, and 3.1% aged 65 or above.The population structure has great diversity, ranging from intellectuals with a high level of education to migrant workers with poor education. It was reported in June 2007 that more than 20 percent of China's PhD graduates had worked in Shenzhen. Shenzhen was also elected as one of the top 10 cities in China for expatriates. Expatriates choose Shenzhen as a place to settle because of the city's job opportunities as well as the culture's tolerance and open-mindedness, and it was even voted China's Most Dynamic City and the City Most Favored by Migrant Workers in 2014.\nAccording to a survey by the Hong Kong Planning Department, the number of cross-border commuters increased from about 7,500 in 1999 to 44,600 in 2009. More than half of them lived in Shenzhen. Though neighboring each other, daily commuters still need to pass through customs and immigration checkpoints, as travel between the SEZ and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is restricted.\nMainland residents who wish to enter Hong Kong for visit are required to obtain an \"Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao\". Shenzhen residents can have a special 1 year multiple-journey endorsement (but maximum 1 visit per week starting from April 13, 2015) This type of exit endorsement is only issued to people who have hukou in certain regions.(See Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macau.)\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\n\n==== Koreans ====\n\nAs of 2007 there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. As of 2014 Donghai had about 200 Korean families.South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC.In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer.There is one Korean international school in Shenzhen, Korean International School in Shenzhen. As of 2007 there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. As of 2014 spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.\n\n\n=== Languages and religions ===\n\nPrior to the establishment of Special Economic Zone, the indigenous local communities could be divided into Cantonese and Hakka speakers, which were two cultural and linguistic sub-ethnic groups vernacular to Guangdong province. Two Cantonese varieties were spoken locally. One was a fairly standard version, known as standard Cantonese. The other, spoken by several villages south of Fuhua Rd. was called Weitou dialect. Two or three Hong Kong villages south of the Shenzhen River also speak this dialect. This is consistent with the area settled by people who accompanied the Southern Song court to the south in the late 13th century. Younger generations of the Cantonese communities now speak the more standard version. Today, some aboriginals of the Cantonese and Hakka speaking communities disperse into urban settlements (e.g. apartments and villas), but most of them are still clustering in their traditional urban and suburban villages.The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has drastically altered the city's linguistic landscape, as Shenzhen has undergone a language shift towards Mandarin, which was both promoted by the Chinese Central Government as a national lingua franca and natively spoken by most of the out-of-province immigrants and their descendants. However, in recent years multilingualism is on the rise as descendants of immigrants of out-of-province Mandarin native speakers begin to assimilate into the local culture through friends, television and other media. Despite the ubiquity of Mandarin Chinese, local languages such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew are still commonly spoken among locals. Hokkien and Xiang are also sometimes observed.According to the Department of Religious Affairs of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government, the two main religions present in Shenzhen are Buddhism and Taoism. Every district also has Protestant churches, Catholic churches, and mosques. According to a 2010 survey held by the University of Southern California, approximately 37% of Shenzhen's residents were practitioners of Chinese folk religions, 26% were Buddhists, 18% Taoists, 2% Christians and 2% Muslims; 15% were unaffiliated to any religion. Most new migrants to Shenzhen rely upon the common spiritual heritage drawn from Chinese folk religion. Shenzhen also hosts the headquarters of the Holy Confucian Church, established in 2009.\n\n\n=== Crime ===\nIn general, Shenzhen is a relatively safe city. However, in districts such as Bao'an and Longgang, the number of robberies, extortion, kidnapping, and fraud exceeds the national average. In the central part of the Luohu District, especially in the neighborhoods around the Shenzhen Railway Station, Shenzhen Bus Terminal, and the Luohu Commercial City Shopping Center, pickpocketing, prostitution, drug trafficking, fraud, and the sale of counterfeit bills are common. In addition, Luohu is a major center for trade in counterfeit goods and abundant in its nightclubs, bars, and karaoke salons, which not only attracts Shenzhen residents, but also residents from neighboring Hong Kong, which may attract criminal elements. The Nanshan District has a large concentration of foreigners, and is known for its abundance of prostitutes and beggars. Along with local gangs in Shenzhen, there is a notable presence of triads: notably Wo Shing Wo, Big Circle Gang, Sun Yee On, 14K, and Shui Fong. The level of corruption in the government is usually high, as seen in the arrest of the then-mayor of Shenzhen, Xu Zongheng, for accepting bribes in June 2009, as well as arrests and convictions of Li Yugo, the former head of the largest state-owned construction corporation in the city, and Zhao Yutsun, a customs officer of the city, for the same reasons.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nShenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as \"the world leader completing new skyscrapers,\" as it managed to complete 14 skyscrapers that are above 200 meters in 2018, four more than Dubai, and keeping this title for three years. In addition, the city is home to the most number of skyscrapers above 200 meters than any other cities in the world, with 82 completed as of July 2019. The city is ranked the third in the world in terms of the number of buildings above 150 meters, with 223 of them completed as of July 2019, after Hong Kong and New York City. There were more skyscrapers completed in Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined. The construction boom continues today with over 60 skyscrapers under construction across the city as of 2019. The tallest building in Shenzhen is the 599-meter, 115 floor Ping An Finance Centre, which is also the second tallest in China and the fourth tallest building in the world. The second-tallest building is the Kingkey 100, rising 441.8 metres (1,449 ft) and containing 100 floors of office and hotel spaces. Shenzhen is also the home to the Shun Hing Square (Diwang Building), the tallest in Asia (if the antenna is taken into account) when it was built in 1996. Guomao Building was furthermore the tallest building in China when it was completed in 1985.In addition to the Shenzhen's modern skyscrapers, Shenzhen also has a significant number of historical buildings. Chiwan Fort is located on a small seaside hill in the Nanshan District. Today, what is left only represents a fragment of the large fortress, as it was partially destroyed by the British during the Opium Wars. Tianhou Temple in the Nanshan District is dedicated to the goddess Mazu, a tutelary deity for fishermen and sailors. According to legend, the temple was founded in 1410 by Admiral Zheng He after his fleet survived a strong storm in the Pearl River Delta. The temple is repeatedly rebuilt and repaired. Part of the temple was converted to a museum, but the rest still continues to function as a religious building. The tomb of the last emperor of the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhao Bing, is located in the Nanshan district. The modern tomb dates back to the end of the 19th century, when a Hong Kong clan announced one of the imperial tombs after a long search, though this is disputed by historians. The tomb was reconstructed at the beginning of the 20th century, but later it fell into neglect until it was restored again in the 1980s. Dapin Fortress is located in the eastern part of the city, in the same area. It was built in 1394 to protect the coast from pirates and in 1571 suffered a long siege of Japanese corsairs. It later turned into a typical town during the Qing Dynasty, and during the First Opium War, the fortress garrison participated in the fight against the British. Walls and gates, narrow streets, temples, and the residence of the commandant in the fortress are still preserved today.  There is an old fortified Hakka village in the Longgang District, whose the architectural features of which are complemented by the Hakka Culture Museum.\n\nThe old town of Nantou (or Xin'an), located in the Nanshan District, has several historical sites dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. From the 4th century, there existed a significant city, but today most of the old buildings have been replaced by modern buildings. However, there are still a few historical buildings, such as fortress walls and gates dating back to the Ming period, the Guandi Temple (Guan Yu), some military and civilian buildings (for example, the residence of officials, the shop, and the opium house), and several streets.\n\n\n=== Parks and beaches ===\n\nShenzhen offers free admission to over of its twenty public city parks such as People's Park, Lianhuashan Park, Lizhi Park, Zhongshan Park, and Wutongshan Park. The Xianhu Botanical Garden (\u4ed9\u6e56; 'Fairy Lake'), founded in 1982, is spread around the lake of the same name in the Luohu District on an area of 590 hectares. On one of the hills of the garden is Hunfa Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in Shenzhen, which was built in 1985 on the site of an older shrine. Around the lake are a pagoda, tea houses, pavilions, the Museum of Paleontology, a garden of medicinal plants and an azalea garden. Wutongshan National Park (\u68a7\u6850\u5c71) is spread around the mountain of the same name in the Luohu District. From the observation deck, there is a view of the Shenzhen skyline as well as Hong Kong and the surrounding bay, and on the next peak there is a transmission tower of a local television station. Lianhuashan Park (\u83b2\u82b1\u5c71; Lotus Hill) is located on the territory of 150 hectares in the Futian District. At the top of the mountain is a large bronze statue of Deng Xiaoping. The Shenzhen Garden and Flower Exposition Center, established in the Futian District in 2004 for the International Garden Exhibition, has many gardens of various styles, artificial ponds and waterfalls, a pagoda, pavilions, and statues. The Shenzhen Bay Park opened in 2011 which included the nearby Mangrove Park. There are several thematic recreation areas and attractions, and along the 9-kilometer-long coastal strip there is an embankment. The Mangrove Ecopark was established in 2000 in the Futian District and at that time was the smallest national park in China. A large group of birds migrate to the ecopark in the mangroves on an area of 20.6 hectares in a 9-kilometer coastal zone of the Shenzhen Bay. The Shenzhen Safari Park in the Nanshan District combines a zoo and a large zoological center on a territory of 120 hectares. Xili Lake Resort (\u897f\u4e3d\u6e56), located in the Nanshan District, has a park with springs and waterfalls stretching around the lake, surrounded by a canopy, and a pagoda and a pavilion located on the top of Xili Mountain. Zhongshan Park (\u4e2d\u5c71), located in the Nanshan District, is the city's oldest park. It has several artificial lakes and ponds, an old city wall dating back to the 14th century, and many sculptures and monuments, including one of Sun Yat-sen. The Yangtai Mountain Forest Park is located around the 500-meter Yangtai Mountain (\u7f8a\u53f0\u5c71) in the Bao'an District. Nearby the mountain is Shiyan Lake (\u77f3\u5ca9\u6e56), which became a popular place of Xin'an County in the 16th century. It is famous for its several indoor and outdoor pools with hot thermal waters.Shenzhen has several beaches: Dameisha (\u5927\u6885\u6c99; 'big mesa') and Xiaomeisha (\u5c0f\u6885\u6c99; 'small mesa') in the Yantian District, and Jinshawan (\u91d1\u6c99\u6e7e; 'golden sands bay'), Nan'ao (\u5357\u6fb3; 'southern inlet'), and Xichong (\u897f\u51b2) in Dapeng Peninsula (in the vicinity of Dapeng New District, which is administered by the Longgang District).\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBefore the 1980s, Shenzhen's education system was primarily based on primary and limited secondary schooling, with no residents admitted to a university. Since Shenzhen's establishment as a SEZ in the 1980s, migrants poured into the city, and jobs requiring a university education grew. Shenzhen started implementing policies that will help develop a more high-quality education system, borrowing teachers from the best schools in the country with promises of higher pay and benefits. In addition, the city started building new schools and renovating the infrastructure of its existing schools to give teachers a more comfortable environment to teach.In the mid-1980s, as upper secondary education became popular, there was a need for higher education institutions in the city. Opened in 1983, Shenzhen Normal School, later upgraded to Shenzhen Normal College, trained students to become primary school teachers. Approved by the State Council in the same year, Shenzhen University became Shenzhen's first comprehensive full-time higher educational institution. In 1999, the Shenzhen Municipal Government set up the Shenzhen Virtual University Park in the Science and Technology Park, where teachers from China's top universities taught graduate students. In 2011, the innovative Southern University of Science and Technology was established followed in 2018 by the Shenzhen Institute of Technology. Other universities have established campuses in the city, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Harbin Institute of Technology, and Moscow State University.The 9-year compulsory education in Shenzhen is free. Secondary schools such as Shenzhen Middle School, Shenzhen Experimental School, Shenzhen Foreign Languages School, and Shenzhen High School, all of which have an on-line rate of over 90%, are dubbed as \"Shenzhen's four famous schools.\" As of 2015, Shenzhen has 12 higher educational institutions, 335 general secondary schools, 334 primary schools, and 1,489 preschools.According to Laurie Chen of the South China Morning Post, Shenzhen, which had 15 million people as of 2019, had not built as many primary and secondary schools for its populace as it should have, compared to similarly developed cities in China. Laurie Chen cited the acceptance rate of Shenzhen secondary schools in 2018: 35,000 slots were available for almost 80,000 applicants. She also cited how Guangzhou had 961 primary schools while Shenzhen had only 344 primary schools, as well as how Guangzhou's count of primary school teachers exceeded that of Shenzhen's by 17,000; Chen argued that Guangzhou and Shenzhen have similar populations. In response Shenzhen schools began increasing salaries for prospective teachers.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nShenzhen is the second largest transportation hub in Guangdong and South China, trailing behind the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shenzhen has a developed extensive public transportation system, covering rapid transit, buses and taxis, most of which can be accessed by either using a Shenzhen Tong card or using QR codes generated by WeChat mini programs.\nRegarding air transport, Shenzhen is served by its own Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and the neighboring Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). Located 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the center of the city, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport serves as the main hub for passenger airlines Shenzhen Airlines and Donghai Airlines and a main hub for cargo airlines Jade Cargo International, SF Airlines, and UPS Airlines. Together, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport handled 49,348,950 passengers, 355,907 aircraft, and 1,218,502.2 cargo in 2018, making it the 5th busiest airport in China in terms of passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport in the country in terms of aircraft and cargo traffic. In addition to flying through Bao'an International Airport, ticketed passengers can also take ferries from the Shekou Cruise Centre and the Fuyong Ferry Terminal to the Skypier at Hong Kong International Airport. There are also coach bus services connecting Shenzhen with HKIA.\nThe Shenzhen Metro serves as the city's rapid transit system. The extension opened on 8 December 2019 put the network at 303.4 kilometres (188.5 miles) of trackage operating on 8 lines with 215 stations. By 2030 the network is planned to be 8 express and 24 non-express lines totalling 1142 kilometres of trackage. The average daily metro ridership in 2016 is 3.54 million passengers, which accounts for a third of public transportation users in the city. The metro also operates a tram system in the Longhua District.\n\nShenzhen is served by seven inter-city railway stations: Futian, Guangmingcheng, Pingshan, Shenzhen (also known as Luohu Railway Station) Shenzhen East, Shenzhen North, and Shenzhen West. High-speed rail (HSR) lines that go through the city are the Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, and the Xiamen\u2013Shenzhen railway (forms part of the Hangzhou\u2013Fuzhou\u2013Shenzhen passenger railway). Non-HSR lines that go through Shenzhen are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway (forms part of the Kowloon\u2013Canton railway) and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.\nAs of August 2019, the city's bus system encompasses over 900 lines, with a total of over 16,000 electric vehicles, the largest of its kind in the world. The system is operated by multiple companies. As at January 2019 conversion of Shenzhen's taxi fleet to electric vehicles reached 99%. Electric taxis have a blue and white colour scheme. Petroleum fuelled taxis are coloured either green or red.Shenzhen serves as a fabric to China's expressway system. Expressways within the city include the Meiguan Expressway (part of the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway), the Jihe Expressway (part of the G15 Shenhai Expressway), the Yanba Expressway (part of the S30 Huishen Costal Expressway), the S28 Shuiguan Expressway, the Yanpai Expressway (part of the G25 Changshen Expressway and the S27 Renshen Expressway), and the S33 Nanguang Expressway. In response to being rejected from being a part of the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, Shenzhen is constructing a bridge across the Pearl River Delta to connect the city of Zhongshan.Private car ownership has been on the rise in Shenzhen, with the city having over 3.14 million cars in 2014. In response, the city imposed limits on car purchases to reduce traffic and pollution. The purchase of electric cars will be determined by a lottery, while traditional cars will be determined both a lottery and a bidding process. In addition, the city banned passenger vehicles with license plates issued in other places from four of Shenzhen's main districts during peak times on working days as of 29 December 2014.\n\nShenzhen is connected with Hong Kong (city and airport), Zhuhai and Macau through ferries that leave from and arrive at the Shekou Cruise Center. The Fuyong Passenger Terminal in the Bao'an District provide services to and from Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) and Macau (Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal). The Port of Shenzhen is the third busiest container port in the world, handling 27.7 million TEUs in 2018.Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, Shenzhen has the largest number of entry and exit ports, the largest number of entry and exit personnel, and the largest traffic volume in China. Shenzhen is busiest in China when it comes to border crossings, with people entering and exiting the country through the city and Hong Kong reaching 239 million in 2015. In the same year, a total of 15.5 million vehicles crossed the border in Shenzhen, a 0.4% increase of last year.  Border crossing ports include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, and Luohu Port. \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nAs Shenzhen is located in Guangdong, the city historically has a Cantonese culture before its transition to a SEZ. Migrants coming to the city to find work and opportunities have turned Shenzhen into a cultural melting pot. Despite this, the municipal government and some of the residents living in Shenzhen, including those who are not from Guangdong, have invested in keeping and reflecting off the city's Cantonese heritage. Shenzhen has presented itself as a city of opportunity for young people in China. The competitive culture that the city promotes among the youth have resulted in the term \"Shenzhen speed,\" which describes a period of constant competition, quick changes, and high-efficiency.In 2003, the municipal government announced plans to turned Shenzhen into a cultural city by promoting design, animation, and library construction. The municipal government also intends to develop the city's cultural industry in accordance to the 13th Five-Year Plan, establishing the Shenzhen Fashion Creative Industry Association and the 4.6 square-kilometer Dalang Fashion Valley. Shenzhen's cultural industry specializes in being one of the largest handicraft manufacturers in China, and is also an industry center for oil painting in bases such as Dafen Village. Shenzhen also hosts the Shenzhen International Cultural Fair which specializes as an expo for the world's cultural industries, with the first expo being on November 2004. As a result of these developments, Shenzhen was awarded by UNESCO the title of \"United Nations Design Capital\" and was accepted entry into the Creative Cities Network on 7 December 2008.\n\nAs part of turning Shenzhen into a cultural city, the municipal government established the \"Library City\" (\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u4e4b\u57ce) concept in 2003. The plan would create a library network within the city through library construction, service improvement, and create a comfortable reading environment.  By the end of 2015, Shenzhen has 620 public libraries, including 3 city-level public libraries, 8 district-level public libraries, and 609 grassroots libraries.  Notable libraries include the Shenzhen Library and the Shenzhen Children's Library. Shenzhen also has bookstores, with the most notable being Shenzhen Book City in the Futian District. With an operating area of 42,000 square metres (450,000 sq ft), it claimed to be the largest bookstore of Asia at the time of its opening. Shenzhen has a number of museums and art galleries, such as the Shenzhen Museum, the Shenzhen Art Museum, the Shekou Maritime Museum, the Longgang Museum of Hakka Culture, the Shenzhen Museum of Contemporary Art, and the He Xiangning Art Museum. Shenzhen also has a few theaters, notably the Shenzhen Concert Hall, the Shenzhen Grand Theater, and the Shenzhen Poly Theater.\n\nAs with Hong Kong and the surrounding Guangdong province, the main cuisine of Shenzhen is Cantonese. However, due to the recent growth of migrants to the city, Shenzhen also hosts a diverse array of cuisines, from Chinese cuisines such as Chaozhou cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hu Cuisine, and Xiang Cuisine, as well as foreign cuisines such as Korean, Japanese, French, and American. The Yantian District is known for its Chaozhou-based and Hakka-based seafood, with restaurants lined up along the coastline.  Some recreational areas in Shenzhen such as Xianhu Botanical Garden, Donghu Park, and Xiaomeisha, host barbecues where visitors bring their own food.  Street food such as Xinjiang lamb skewers, Northern Chinese pancakes, and black sesame soups, can be found in Xijie Street and the urban village of Baishizhou. Shenzhen also has its own tea culture. In regards to food chains, first McDonald's restaurant in mainland China opened for business in Shenzhen on 8 October 1990, providing the city American fast food. Shenzhen is home to the HeyTea chain of tea shops, which provides a variety of cheese and fruit teas and is popular among social media.Shenzhen has a prominent nightlife culture, with most of the activity centered in the entertainment complexes of COCO Park and Shekou, with the former being referred by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) as \"Shenzhen's answer to Lan Kwai Fong.\" There are many bars and clubs in the city, mostly unregulated, that stay open till the morning.  Tunnel raves, referred by the SCMP as \"a Shenzhen nightlife staple\", have earned a reputation in the world, though they are often cracked down by police.  Police has also cracked down on prostitution and pornography, which were elements of nightlife entertainment in Shenzhen, with one of the most prominent operations being centered in Shazui (\u6c99\u5634\u6751) in the Futian District in the mid-2000s, resulting in closures of entertainment businesses and a decrease of foreign tourists in that area of the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nShenzhen is the home to professional football team Shenzhen F.C., which participates in both China League One and the Chinese Super League. Another local football team, Shenzhen Ledman F.C., was once a part of China League Two until the club was disbanded in 2018. Shenzhen's top-tier basketball team, the Shenzhen Aviators, plays in the Southern Division of the Chinese Basketball Association. Shenzhen F.C. and the Shenzhen Aviators both are tenants of the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre.\nShenzhen Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that hosts many events. The stadium is located in Futian District and has a capacity of 32,500. It was built in June 1993, at a cost of 141 million RMB. The 26th Summer Universiade was held in Shenzhen in August 2011. Shenzhen has constructed the sports venues for this first major sporting event in the city.Shenzhen Dayun Arena is a multipurpose arena.  It was completed in 2011 for the 2011 Summer Universiade.  It is used for the basketball, ice hockey and gymnastics events.  The arena is the home of the Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays of the Canadian Women's Hockey League.\nShenzhen is also a popular destination for skateboarders from all over the world, due to the architecture of the city and its lax skate laws.The Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre was one of the venues at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 2019 to 2028 Shenzhen is hosting the WTA Finals, a major annual professional tennis tournament for the world's most top-ranked female players.\n\n\n== Relationship with Hong Kong ==\n\nHong Kong and Shenzhen have close business, trade, and social links as demonstrated by the statistics presented below. Except where noted the statistics are taken from sections of the Hong Kong Government website.As of September 2016, there are nine crossing points on the boundary between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, among which six are land connections. From west to east these include the Shenzhen Bay Port, Futian Port, Huanggang Port, Man Kam To Port, Luohu Port and Shatoujiao Port. On either sides of each of these ports of entry are road and/or rail transportation.In 2006, there were around 20,500 daily vehicular crossings of the boundary in each direction. Of these 65 percent were cargo vehicles, 27 percent cars and the remainder buses and coaches. The Huanggang crossing was most heavily used at 76 percent of the total, followed by the Futian crossing at 18 percent and Shatoujiao at 6 percent.  Of the cargo vehicles, 12,000 per day were container carrying and, using a rate of 1.44 teus/vehicle, this results in 17,000 teus/day across the boundary, while Hong Kong port handled 23,000 teus/day during 2006, excluding trans-shipment trade.\n\nTrade with Hong Kong in 2006 consisted of US$333 billion of imports of which US$298 billion were re-exported. Of these figures 94 percent were associated with China.  Considering that 34.5 percent of the value of Hong Kong trade is air freight (only 1.3 percent by weight), a large proportion of this is associated with China as well.Also in 2006 the average daily passenger flow through the four connections open at that time was over 200,000 in each direction of which 63 percent used the Luohu rail connection and 33 percent the Huanggang road connection.  Naturally, such high volumes require special handling, and the largest group of people crossing the boundary, Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship, use only a biometric ID card (Home Return Permit) and a thumb print reader. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport, the 5th busiest international airport in the world, handled 59,000 passengers per day in each direction.Hong Kong conducts regular surveys of cross-boundary passenger movements, with the most recent being in 2003, although the 2007 survey will be reported on soon. In 2003 the boundary crossings for Hong Kong Residents living in Hong Kong made 78 percent of the trips, up by 33 percent from 1999, whereas Hong Kong and Chinese residents of China made up 20 percent in 2006, an increase of 140 percent above the 1999 figure. Since that time movement has been made much easier for China residents, and so that group have probably increased further still. Other nationalities made up 2 percent of boundary crossings. Of these trips 67 percent were associated with Shenzhen and 42 percent were for business or work purposes. Of the non-business trips about one third were to visit friends and relatives and the remainder for leisure.After Shenzhen's attempts to be included in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project were rejected in 2004, a separate bridge was conceived connecting Shenzhen on the Eastern side of the Pearl River Delta with the city of Zhongshan on the Western side: the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge.\n\n\n==== Qianhai ====\n\nQianhai, which means foresea in Chinese language, formally known as the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industries Cooperation Zone, is \"a useful exploration for China to create a new opening up layout with a more open economic system.\" A 15 km2 (5.8 sq mi) area located in western Shenzhen, Qianhai lies at the heart of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to Shenzhen international airport. Strategically positioned as a zone for the innovation and development of modern services, Qianhai will facilitate closer cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as act as the catalyst for industrial reform in the Pearl River Delta. With the goal of loosening capital account restrictions, Qianhai authorities have indicated that Hong Kong banks will be allowed to extend commercial RMB loans to Qianhai-based onshore mainland entities. The People's Bank of China has also indicated that such loans will for the first time not be subject to the benchmark rates set by the central bank for all other loans in the rest of China. According to Anita Fung from HSBC, \"This new measure on cross-border lending will enhance the co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and accelerate cross-border convergence.\"\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nShenzhen has an advanced public media network, boasting one radio station, two TV stations, three broadcasting and TV centers, 19 cable broadcasting and TV sub-stations. In Shenzhen, there are 14 newspapers, one comprehensive publishing house, three video-audio products publishing houses, 88 bureaus of inland and Hong Kong media organizations, 40 periodicals, and about 200 kinds of in-house publications of which the majority belong to enterprises. The most prominent media companies in Shenzhen are the Shenzhen Media Group, the Shenzhen Press Group, China Entertainment Television (CETV), and Phoenix Television branch iFeng.Shenzhen News (\u6df1\u5733\u665a\u62a5, sznews.com) is a Chinese-language newspaper owned by the Shenzhen Press Group that serves as Shenzhen's main online new source. Shenzhen Daily is an English-language news outlet for Shenzhen. It also covers local, national and international news. That's Shenzhen is the Shenzhen edition of That's PRD, an English-language media company with an online, print and social footprint. That's Shenzhen covers news, arts, lifestyle and events in the city. ShekouDaily.com is an online media outlet providing news and resources that focus on the Shekou sub-district in Nanshan District of Shenzhen.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nShenzhen has been very active in cultivating sister city relationships. In October 1989, Shenzhen Mayor Li Hao and a delegation travelled to Houston to attend the signing ceremony establishing a sister city relationship between Houston and Shenzhen. Houston became the first sister city of Shenzhen. Up to 2015, Shenzhen has established sister city relationship with 25 cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Other twinnings ===\nThe Shenzhen Port is twinned and has collaboration agreements with:\n\n The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, June 2013.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Shenzhen-related articles\nAdministrative divisions of the People's Republic of China\nEconomy of China\nList of twin towns and sister cities in China\nPearl River (China)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBach, Jonathan (August 2010). \"\"THEY COME IN PEASANTS AND LEAVE CITIZENS\": Urban Villages and the Making of Shenzhen, China\".

          "We went to happy Valley with three children, 6 and 8. Most of the rides, including the kiddie rides are for over 140cm only which meant that our choice was limited to VR experience and a very limited number of activities. The park is worn down, there\u2019s a lot of extras that are",
          "Went to Shenzhen for sightseeing and Happy Valley after reading all reviews without hesitation we went to explore the park, its a great experience and beautiful park and great show though its in mandarin, need to give one day to explore the whole place, Great experienced \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "It's Normal theme Park. Most of Rides are Outdated and Some Rides are Closed. Near to Window of the World. Nearest Subway Station Window of the World (Line 2) long queues, expensive, avoid Chinese Public Holidays and weekends to Visit",
          "My first visit to Shenzhen is especially for the Teamlab, this is a famous light photo from Japan. Great shows and spent lots of time with my besties. Besides the teamlab, also many great street decor for photos. P.S. Teamlab ends on 30 Nov 2017",
          "I enjoyed my visit to Happy Valley. The flower field is one that I have never seen before!!! It was breath taking. The colors were amazing. I also enjoyed the garden of space pumpkins. I learned and appreciated the information I got from the garden plant descriptions. Great",
          "Came back after 6 years but still no progress. Only good thing was park was empty. Only few slides are open in water park rest are always closed as usual. And 2 slides have some stupid rules that if you are over 80 kgs you cannot sit on it. We finished the water park by 5 30.",
          "I went with two other friends. We went mainly for the water park. We arrived at around 11 to find most rides didn't open into half 11/12 and the water park didn't open till 12. It was a little disappointing. We rode some rides and with the waiting we only managed 4 before the",
          "Nice place , Bit expensive , Entire day will fly off.... A must place to see in Shenzhen , OCT itself is a beautiful township between Shennan road...",
          "The park was clean and well maintained but lacked the diversity/range of thrill seeking that westerners expect from their amusement parks. Only 2 roller coasters and very long lines. It was fun for a day but I wouldn't go back again. It is very family friendly if you have kids!",
          "Spent a few hours here, mostly waiting in lines for the rides. From my understanding I was here in quiet time (Wednesday at around 11am), so I imagine it's very hard to actually ride something in peak times. There is a large water park, which I didn't get a chance to try, but",
          "Everyone in Shenzhen knows Happy Valley and enjoys an evening out shopping and eating there. Its a large area and you need 3-4 hours to get a feel of the place. This area is another one that I would recommend to go to with Chinese friends. That also makes eating easier since",

          "I think the title says it all... The food is pretty good and the shows are entertaining. Be forewarned though, they are all in Mandarin. Good atmosphere. Tons to do. Peace!",
          "Both Ocean Park and Disneyland in Hong Kong are way better than this. There are no unique rides and the rides overall are quite outdated. Expensive admission and food. Get there by taking the MTR to Window of the World.",
          "It's little old and nothing new If compare other amusement parks It's is outdated totally If you compare one Gounzhou happy valley is nothing",
          "Good place to visit if you are in Shenzhen but not something to plan and travel especially to visit this park. The park is composed of nine themed areas including Spanish Square, Cartoon City, Mt. Adventure, Gold Mine Town, Shangri-la Woods, Sunshine Beach, Typhoon Bay, Playa",
          "We took the subway and stop to the Window of the world. On the opposite side there is a way to the Happy Valley and walk about 15 minutes to the theme park. the tickets is cost 230 yuan per person and for the child below 1.2meter is free. For 230 yuan cost you have access to all",
          "Yesterday i visted but worst place to visit in my life. To crowded, staff too rude and stupid water not clean and smelly.",
          "The worst place to play, so crowded. very long Q on the games, I wait around 1:30 hour on the roller coaster then suddenly they told us that go away as it is broken, but after 10 min it starts working (after they flush the huge Q). I paid 230 RMB and played only game during",
          "We had been 2 times for the last month;) the tickets is cost 230rmb per person and you have access to all area of amusement ride. We didn't have mouth time to discover outside rides, but we stayed only in the pool area,which is pretty nice if you have a baby. We just took a sits",
          "I visited Happy Valley in July 2016 during my visit in Mainland China. The theme park is easily accessible by yourself, just take the metro and get out at the 'Window of the World' station. Then just follow the crowd and signposts to the park, don't go mistakenly to Window of",
          "I went to Happy Valley with my wife and 2 kids. Lots of exciting rides there, suitable for adults and kids. Many stalls selling local foods and tidbits inside the park, but fast food chains such as KFC and Pizza Hut are located outside the park. Don't know whether can go out",
          "We took the MTR to Happy Valley stop and then walked about 1km to the park. The park itself has lots of awesome rides to keep everybody entertained for a full day. Our favourite activity was the river raft ride, you get quite wet but it is fun and there are water cannons at",
          "Like this place for its multicultural spirit. Great place to eat and feel good. Love the Mexican restaurantv there. Good place to spend half of the day.",
          "We went there together with my wife already two times and both times were just great! All this big attractios were so much fun! The best is the biggest American style fast cars! The aquapark was nice too... There are a lot of places to eat and drink! We will be back for sure!",
          "This was a great day! Lots of great rides, the place has potential for a five star but its upkeep lets it down. It is rather shabby and a dirty sad to say. The variety of rides and attractions however are fantastic. I loved it.",
          "Parts of this amusement park are a complete and total rip-off of Disneyland. That being said, the rides are great and it is still tremendous fun! And, surprisingly, the rides are well maintained! The best time of year is when its hot; the water-slide area cannot be beat. But,",
          "70% or was it 80% of the rides were closed. The ticket office forgot to mention this when we bought our ticket. And it wasn't a language barrier either as I can speak a little Mandarin. What few rides were open were unique and interesting. I personally am not one for fun fair",
          "This is really a very good place to visit. Shenzhen does not have a lot of things to see since it has mostly commercial activities. Well this is surely a place to visit",
          "if anybody wants to know the china and it's culture then this place is best and must visit. Try to make it around evening. lightening are good and place is enjoyable. spectacular china and happy valley.",
          "It was a great experience for me, i had the chance to try the roller-coaster there, the food is over priced, very big place but just few things to play and many shows, anyway it's a perfect place for some fun.",
          "Although the visit was last year, the experience is still fresh in my mind.Living so close to the gold coast and having visited Disney Hong Kong, my family (including 10 & 9 boys), were keen to try a Chinese theme park. Some of the rides were more than 10 years old and they",
          "Such a great day. 200rmb may seem a lot but the rides are more than worth it. Super fast roller coaster water rides and high rides. Lots of fair ground attractions also. Perfect for young children if you have them. I really enjoyed the various shows also. The food choices are",
          "We have a year pass. 630cny which is cheap cheap cheap since the play areas in malls are this or more for only a month or two. We went once on Spring Festival 3rd day and was empty. Go when empty! Mondays are a good bet. Get the year pass and leave if too busy. Go during",
          "Good place to be for some fun and free time with kids. Plenty of things to do in and around this place.",
          "Please don't go at winter and specially Wednesday of they stop almost all performing and nothing to enjoy expect few things. I can't find even a good map or any direction to the park inside. I enjoy the 4D 15 minutes show and cost roller also got some problem can't ride it. Just",
          "I'm tall (1.95m) so if the staff actually measured me, I wouldn't be able to ride any rides. I went in the off season (November) and it wasn't \\that\\ busy. However, it was still hot, and the water park was closed, so that was kind of a bummer. It is your standard amusement",
          "Chose Happy Valley as a day trip for my boyfriend and I to take a break from our hectic schedules. We weren't expecting too much as its an Amusement Park, which in general aren't \"breathtaking\" tourist attractions. Spent approx 4 - 5 hours there, rode plenty of rides - some",
          "Happy Valley (\u6b22\u4e50\u8c37 - Hu\u0101nl\u00e8 G\u016d) has nine themed areas, of which, 8 were open yesterday (Spanish Square, Cartoon City, Mt. Adventure, Gold Mine Town, Shangri-La Woods, Sunshine Beach, Typhoon Bay, and Happy Times. The Playa Maya Water Park was closed. Some rides remained closed",
          "We had a lot of expectations of Happy Valley, especially after paying 200 rmb for the tickets! The park itself is nice but the rollercoaster and all the amusement rides are inefficient and not comparable to western parks! The biggest ride which was also the most interesting was",
          "Hot in Shenzhen ? If you are looking for somewhere to enjoy classic amusement with sensations or surprising playground .... you are at the right place. from 3 to more than 80 years old ...you can enjoy games, show, nice view from the top of the pirat boat. 1st do not forget to",
          "It's a big park with enough to keep you busy all day. We were there for about 12 hours and still didn't do everything. The Halloween Haunted Houses are great and genuinely scary! The queues were quite long, but all except one moved quickly. They have a good range of rides from",
          "Most rides are old. Price was 200yuan which in my opinion was too much for what you expect. Don't bother with the upgrading of the ticket package with the monorail to the other parks.",
          "When you are asked to pay R400.00 or 200 RMB to enter you would be forgiven for thinking that the entire park is operational, not so, more than half of the best rides are not working and the queues are horrendous. Not for everyone.",
          "If you want to go somewhere you can have fun , high feelings, water crazy amusement (do not forget your swimsuit and towels) you are at the right place ... During day and night you can enjoy all these types of fun from inca pyramid and water play zone to classical park ... Crazy",

          "Visited first in November 2012, this is definitely one of the best spots to take photos, see new attractions. It certainly provided this Western European/cultural architectures that most of the Chinese craved for! This is pretty close to the Windows of the World in Shenzhen!",

          "This theme park is huge. There is also another water theme park within this park. There are lots of rides and quite a lot to explore. My complaint is that the line is too long. We waited almost 2 hours for one ride in the morning. In the afternoon, the queuing time was",
          "From the outside, it looks like there's a lot there but there wasn't at all...very deceiving. We saw a hotel (City Inn) and a couple of cafes/restaurants and a Ice Skating rink but there was a lot of areas not open to the public.",

          "Nice place. But if you want try out any ride you have to wait on the queue hours (I went there on a weekend however) Either which way the rides are great. Lots of attractions. The rides on the water was great. The Haunting houses were pretty basic. Not much adrenaline rush",
          "I took my daughter there last year and enjoyed the park. There is many great rides to choose from and lines are not to long. The one thing I didn't like is the largest roller coaster was not working. I believe it is down much of the time. They do great job of decorating the park",
          "I went with my 5 year old kid on a weekday just after Easter. - in brief: many attractions are in serious need of maintenance or are not even open. Other attractions are more suitable for older kids taller than 1,3m or even 1,4m. The amusement park was not too busy during the",

          "Only managed 4 or 5 rides. Just too many people. Prefer the smaller parks around town. The rides are less thrilling, but you can ride and ride and ride all day without the lines.",
          "This place is a huge waste of money. If you have a larger frame, don't bother. I explicitly asked at the front gate, before I bought tickets, if I could ride the rides, because I know that I am a big guy. The attendant assured me that there would be no problem with",

          "Went during the week, so it wasn't very crowded at all. We also went in the winter, and didn't expect the water park to be open, though we were surprised that the largest roller coaster wasn't operational for no reason. Our kids were not pleased, but that's China for you.",
          "We went in summer and the best part of the whole place was the waterpark. The downsides of the roller coaster theme park is that around 3 or so of the biggest, best and most impressive roller coasters were not functional. Either they were broken or simply not open. This was",
          "To be fair, we went during the winter slow season, so many attractions and rides were closed. The roller coasters looked OK, but the other rides looked so-so. Kids will like it, of course. Entry for adults is 200 yuan (about USD32). To get there: take the MTR line 1 or line 2",
          "We went there around 18hrs. Tickets at RMB80 instead of RMB200. Average park as all water based attractions closed at that time. Remaining attractions cannot accomodate strong European profiles as seats not adequate. 3D cinema was excellent. For travelling families, i recommend",

          "That's all there is here, and coffee shops. There is a huge boat that's a bar and restaurant (and possibly a hotel too). I can't see why you would want to bring kids here. They'll be bored and then fall into the water. The name implies that there might be an aquarium - there",
          "Sea world everything from the good restaurants to entertaining night clubs to sleazy bars and worse. All within less than a square kilometre. What started as a free haven for ship and oil rig staff off duty has now become the place to go for expats. Best see for yourself...",
          "We stayed in sea world for 1 day and it's worth to visit with family or just get away from town place. Lots of local and western restaurants, beautiful place for relax",
          "There doesn't seem to be a whole lot to do in this area of Shenzhen so Sea World is a welcomed spot. There are a number of great hotels and many western chains. If you done speak mandarin, this is the place to be as most people speak English.",
          "Shekou Sea World is actually built around a ship, Named Minghua. It is now a hotel and entertainment complex.This place have a lot of bars and eateries. Also have two-three clubs to hit the dance floor like club Viva... go around 8 pm to see the fountain show with lights !",
          "Amazing free musical Water fountain show everyday @ 7.00/8.00 & 9.00 pm everyday for 10 minutes near sea world metro station in Shenzhen. A cruise is also found near the venue which converted to restaurants. Very good attractive lightings on cruise and surroundings. I loved the",
          "The ship used to be on the real sea back in 1990s then the gov. did all those landfills and transformed this place numerous times just to make it more upscale and artificial Will never forget the days when you can swim iand walk on the cement bridge on the waters, and when",
          "Had a great time in sea world , visited many decent restaurants , good local bars and night clubs , always plenty to do and see during the night time. Prices were spot on for a place with a good mix of westerners and locals. Found a good bar just up the street fom Sea World ,",
          "This place was build as a tourist attraction but it has lots of locals too. Lots of western food and even a light show at night (on the hour). Not cheap but right on the metro and nice for a few hours of wondering around.",
          "I have had a celebration dinner at this restaurant / boat which is parked in something that looks like a pond. At night there is a fantastic water show, music, water fountains and firecrackers combined, is fantastic. Meals where ok, drinks even better. Try the Chinese Mouthai,",
          "Please research before you get caught up on the hype of the name \"Seaworld\". This attraction is not your original idea of what you expect Seaworld to look like if you have ever been to the real Seaworld. This location has multiple restaurants, bars, cafe's, nightclubs for",
          "I always go to SeaWorld at least once on my trips to south China and get my fix for all the European food I've been missing. Shekou, being an expat center, can support all sorts of foreign restaurants, so whatever your preference, they have it. There is a light show several",
          "Recommended for afternoon trips on weekdays (probably busy here on weekend days). Take a stroll along the harbour promenade and eat dinner at one of the many restaurants. Be sure to watch the fountain/light show in the evening. Very nice!",
          "I visited Seaworld several times. Why? Because it' s beautiful. Many restaurants to visit. A great ship is in the center. On this ship you can eat at several restaurants. During the week there is a lightshow in the water thats around. From the center you can walk to and climb",
          "Is it over rated - probably BUT it's a great place to go. Restaurants from all over the world - we chose Japanese but there is literally everything here. If you go at night the water and light shows are great and it has a really nice atmosphere too.",
          "Seaworld has a long history in Shenzhen as one of the places where a lot of expats gather. It's been growing a lot lately with the addition of a lot of restaurants. Before it used to be a central square in front of a marooned ship but now there's a lot of expansion around it. It",
          "Most visitors come to Shenzhen for business reasons. Sea World feels out of place in a positive way. Imagine beer garden out door dining with lots of options for western food. Since Shenzhen is warm all year round, it is a great location for open space dining. As it is a bit far",
          "This was a pleasant discovery. Never heard of the place before but was told by a friend to try and so we stayed here for 2 nights-3 days at the Hilton nearby. Basically the whole area is a collection of restaurants, bars, nightlife, some shops and spa. Whilst you can walk around",
          "Sea World Shekou is a marvellous and vast complex of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. Very near to the Hong Kong - Shekou ferry terminal. Whatever you like for breakfast, daytime or evening food and entertainment. Fantastic live music venues and lots of open air sights too.",
          "The atmosphere there is great with many people waiting for the music fountain opening. Very beautiful light and fountain shows.",
          "Sea World is essentially just a square with lots of restaurants and a cruise ship moored in the middle. Light and water show is on Tues-Sun at 19:00, 19:30 and 20:00 and is a bit of fun.",

          "The Sea World I am familiar with in San Diego, California is basically water-themed amusement park with great shows and all kinds of aquatic displays. This one called Sea World in Shenzhen shares same name but is just a nice, clean commercial area with all kinds of restaurants,",
          "Must come to Sea World if you travel to Shenzhen. This is a vessel, a real vessel on land. At night, this place is fantastic.",
          "We actually just stumbled upon this looking for a restaurant. This area is the place to be if you want to meet up with other ex-pats. At the end of the day its a ship with restaurants around it. Nothing exciting.",
          "With a stroller it is impossible to navigate. Stairs are everywhere without elevator or escalator... For elders or babies it is not convenient at all. A lot of western restaurants which is great even if sometimes it is expensive. By the way, because it is pedestrian area,",
          "You can find every kinds of food there. There price was cheap and the place was clean and well decorated. It was a good place for shopping and relaxation that might find every thing there.",

          "Not really my first time in the place but it never failed to amazed me everytime I go there. The Ship that you well see from the entrance of the place is the landmark of the place and you shouldn't forget to take pictures with you\ud83d\ude09. There's plenty of of restaurants to choice",
          "Nice for chilling out. Many restaurants to choose from in different cuisines. Nice view for strolling though a lot of people during weekends. Water show is also interesting. They also have some mini concerts during night time.",
          "Shekou sea world is the best place for anyone who wants to enjoy world cuisines in Shenzhen , the Mexican at coyote is one of my all time favourites , just 5 minutes from shekou ferry port you may also get confused that you are in China with so many expats in this area, it has",
          "nice area with a lot of restaurant and bar around, some massage shop also. the water show is amazing,",
          "Sea World has quite a nice theme. Located in Shekou, with direct access to the metro system, Sea World is the home to the Ming Hua, a Chinese cruiser that is located in a pool and contains a couple of bars, restaurants and a hotel. If you're going for the food and not the",
          "This is a Shopping center!! One of my colleague thought this was like the Sea World in the states and decided to plan a trip to make it out here. There is a huge ship that is also a restaurant and have random water shows. But, other then that it is a shopping center.",
          "I visited this in the evening. They had a nice water and light show and had a lot of places to eat in the vicinity. The ship is close to the pier and so nice place to take a walk as well. Lots of places to eat close by and very lively from a people perspective.",

          "Good place to eat, walk and have lots of fun specialy night time. Lots of foreigners in the area. Plenty of places to eat and dring (Irish, english pubs, bars and gardens).",
          "This place deliberately has avoided giving space over to retailers. Which means it's got a great buzzy atmosphere in the evening. Built in totally reclaimed land, the ship that you see in the photo has been sat there for decades, and has finally been renovated along with this",
          "This is a very nice place for friends, family, business, couples or solo, a lot of nice restaurants with different favor there. And there is a night music spray fountain at 7 pm, 8pm and 9pm. if you want some nice beers, just go to there as well, the Boat has a very nice German",
          "When Im in Shenzhen I always stay in Seaworld area. Its much more western, and also has lots of good restaurants. Its not a typical chinese experience, but after working in GuangZhou its a great place to get a more western experience of China. Also the mountain behind Seaworld",

          "Basically, Sea World is just a huge amount of different restaurants and bars arranged around a small man made pond that has a large ship in it where they have a light show a couple of times a night. Throw in a couple of different places to get a massage and a few boutique",
          "Excellent place to go for a night if you want to hit a few bars or eat out. I found it to be a hang out for many expat foreigner's and English seemed to be widely spoken here. There are also lots of little bars, cafes and restaurants on the surrounding streets, so have a walk",
          "love this place! fun and pretty and many places to eat and drink. at night they have a nightly water show with music,",
          "I wouldn't say there is anything really special about the area.. its more like a strip mall of tiny restaurants and bars. Oh and lets not forget the old boat at the end!! LOL... Actually, apart from the foreign owned/style bar on the far left of the boat, the rest of it is",

          "A huge vessel in the middle of land, turned into restaurant cum hotel?! Water fountain show at the pool of water with fire, smoke and lasers? It was all kind of strange and weird to me. Lots of restaurants in the area though, and they are not cheap by China standards. Yet,",
          "Good place and nice food, but i was angry with the hotel lived. I traveled to Shenzhen China on Jun 17 2015 and lived in Hilton Shenzhen Nanhai hotel.in the morning Jun 18, I went to swimming pool of hotel. After shower, I push the glass door to go outside, the door exploded",
          "We hit up Tairyo \"Big Fish\" Teppanyaki. The are is great to grab a coffee or a bite to eat. We stopped off here after taking the Shekou Ferry up for the Linkin Park show. I strongly recommend to eat here if you are in Shenzhen and are in the area. Spoiled for choice.",

          "This beautifully designed area on the waterfront is a real treat to browse through for many hours. The far south metro stop is by the same name, Sea World, so it is easy to find. The highlight of the area is a grounded ship called Minghua, converted into a hotel. Around the",

Its 18,931 square meter lot was purchased by Ping An Group via auction at a price of 1.6568 billion RMB on 6 November 2007. Design of the building began in 2008 with Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates providing the architectural design and Thornton Tomasetti providing structural design. Its foundation stone was laid on 29 August 2009, and construction started in November the same year. China Construction First Building Group was hired as the general contractor to construct the building.On 15 March 2013, the construction process was temporarily halted, due to the suspected use of concrete made with unprocessed sea sand, which could corrode the steel structure. Construction resumed on the building after sample testing.\nOn the morning of 15 July 2014, upon a 10-meter-long steel column being lifted to place, the skyscraper exceeded 443.8 meters in height, surpassing the KK100 Tower to become the tallest building in Shenzhen.\nThe building topped out on 30 April 2015, and became the second tallest skyscraper in China at a height of 599 meters. The original plan was to add a 60-meter-long antenna atop the building to surpass the Shanghai Tower and become the tallest building in China. However, in February 2015, it was decided that the antenna would not top the tower due to the possibility that it might obstruct flight paths.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe building contains office, hotel and retail spaces, a conference center, and a high-end shopping mall. Floor 116 feature an observation deck named Free Sky. As its name suggests, it is also the headquarters of Ping An Insurance. The design of the building is meant to be unique and elegant, and to represent the history and achievements of the main tenant. A stainless-steel facade that weighs approximately 1,700 metric tons provides a modern design to the building.The building has a total gross floor area of 378,600 square meters. The 115-story tower has a width-to-height aspect ratio of 1:10 and also has an 11-story podium. Including the podium, the building has 495,520 square meters of floor space. A five-level basement adds another 90,000 square meters of area. The 620,000 metric ton tower has eight main columns which form the superstructure. The column dimensions range from approximately 6 by 3.2 m at the lowest level to 2.9 by 1.4 m at the top of the tower.\n\n\n== Elevators ==\nThe Ping An International Finance Center is equipped with 33 double deck elevators, with its Destination Control going at speeds of up to 10 m/s.\n\n\n== Climbing attempts ==\nThe Ping An Financial Center has been the subject of frequent rooftopping attempts. In January 2015, daredevil Malaysian photographer Keow Wee Loong climbed the then incomplete building and released video footage and a photo taken from a crane at the tower's top.The structure was subsequently climbed during Chinese New Year on 19 February 2015 by two Russian and Ukrainian urban explorers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov from Ontheroofs, who further climbed out to a crane above the under-construction tower and documented their ascent with video and photos.\n\n\n== Phase 2 ==\nThe second building of the project, a 290-meter, 47-story skyscraper known as the South Tower, has been completed. Construction began in April 2014 and it opened in 2018/19. The complex includes a 5-star Park Hyatt hotel, a planned retail bridge connecting the two skyscrapers from levels 3 through 6.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nPing An Finance Center, Shenzhen\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBurj Khalifa\nShanghai Tower\nList of tallest buildings in Shenzhen\nList of tallest buildings in the world\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThorton Tomasetti\nPingan International Finance Center on Emporis.com",

        "wiki": "Yuen Long (Chinese: \u5143\u6717) is a town in the western New Territories, Hong Kong. To its west lie Hung Shui Kiu (\u6d2a\u6c34\u6a4b), Tin Shui Wai, Lau Fau Shan and Ha Tsuen, to the south Shap Pat Heung and Tai Tong, to the east Au Tau and Kam Tin (\u9326\u7530), and to the north Nam Sang Wai.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Cantonese name Yuen Long may refer to the limits of the original market town, Yuen Long New Town, Yuen Long Plain or Yuen Long District.\n\n\n== Market town ==\nThe central part of Yuen Long was traditionally a market town, in the area now known as Yuen Long San Hui (\u5143\u6717\u65b0\u589f), in Yuen Long District, where people from the surrounding villages sold their crops and fish. The market is still a place where people from villages in the northwest New Territories shop and trade. Like many market towns in Hong Kong, the market operates only on certain days each week. Modern shopping malls and restaurants have also established.\n\n\n== New towns ==\n\nTwo new towns have been developed in Yuen Long since the 1970s:\nYuen Long New Town was developed by the market town in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nTin Shui Wai New Town was established in the 1990s to the west of Yuen Long New Town, as separate from Yuen Long New Town. It is mostly residential.\nThere are Light Rail Transit and several bus routes serving between the two towns.\n\n\n== Housing estate ==\nThe private residential estate Fairview Park is in the northeast part of Yuen Long.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest market in Yuen Long was south of the main road, near Tai Kei Leng. In 1669, the market was moved north to the area near the present-day Yuen Long Station. This area is now known as Yuen Long Kau Hui (\u5143\u6717\u820a\u589f, lit. \"old Yuen Long Town\").  This market is sited south of a small hill.  While it is far from the coast today, it was beside the seashore when the market was first built.\nCheung Shing Street, which separates Nam Pin Wai and Sai Pin Wai, divides the centre of the market.  Temples were built for worship and to judge disputes. After the British leased the New Territories in 1898, they built Castle Peak Road to connect major areas of the New Territories and Kowloon. The villagers proposed and moved the market town to the main road. After the Second World War, Yuen Long Town dramatically increased in size, going from a small village into a large town known for its numerous cultural and sporting events.\n\n\n=== 2019 Yuen Long attack ===\n\nThe 2019 Yuen Long attack was a mob attack that occurred on 21 July 2019, in Yuen Long, Hong Kong. A mob of over 100 armed men dressed in white indiscriminately attacked civilians on the streets and passengers in the Yuen Long MTR station including the elderly, children, black-clad protesters, journalists and lawmakers. At least 45 people were injured in the incident, including a pregnant woman. The attack happened following an anti-extradition bill protest in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong and was an act threatening the pro-democracy protesters who were returning home to Yuen Long.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n== Cross-border activities ==\nDue to their proximity to the Shenzhen border in China's Guangdong province, towns in the northern parts of Hong Kong, notably Sheung Shui and Yuen Long, have become hubs for parallel traders who have been buying up large quantities of goods, forcing up local prices and disrupting the daily lives of local citizens. Since 2012, there has been a vertiginous increase in Chinese parallel traders arriving in the North District of Hong Kong to re-export infant formula and household products \u2013 goods popular with the Chinese \u2013 across the border to Shenzhen. Trafficking caused chronic local shortages of milk powder in Hong Kong, which led the government to impose restrictions on the amount of milk powder exports from Hong Kong.The first anti-parallel trading protest was started at Sheung Shui in September 2012. As government efforts to limit the adverse impact of Chinese trafficking were widely seen as inadequate, there have been further subsequent protests in towns in the North District including Sheung Shui. A campaign called Liberate Yuen Long was mounted on 1 March 2015 by localist groups to protest smuggling and parallel trading.\n\n\n== Public transport ==\nThe following information show transportation in Yuen Long.\n\n\n=== Inside Yuen Long Town ===\n\n\n==== Buses ====\nKMB routes 53, 54, 64K, 68A, 68E, 68F, 68M, 68X, 76K, 77K, 264R, 268B, 268C, 268P, 268X, 269D, 276, 276P, 869, 968, 968X, B1, N269, N368\nRoute B1 to Lok Ma Chau Station Control Point, a customs checkpoint between Hong Kong and China\nMTR Bus routes K65, K66, K68, K73, K74\nLong Win Bus routes A36, E34B, E34P, N30, N30S, NA34\nNew Lantao Bus route B2\nRoute B2 to Shenzhen Bay Port, a customs checkpoint between Hong Kong and China\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nMTR West Rail Line\nLight Rail routes 610, 614, 615 and 761P\n\n\n=== Outside Yuen Long Town (except via Yuen Long Town) ===\n\n\n==== Buses ====\nKMB routes 51, 64S, 69C, 69M, 69P, 69X, 251A, 251B, 251M, 265B, 265M, 265S, 269A, 269B, 269C, 269M, 269P, 276A, 276B\nMTR Bus routes K75, K75A, K75P\nLong Win Bus routes A37, E34A, E34X\nNew Lantao Bus routes B2P, B2X\nRoutes B2P and B2X to Shenzhen Bay Port, a customs checkpoint between Hong Kong and China\nCitybus routes 967, 967X, 969, 969A, 969B, 969C, 969P, 969X, N969\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nMTR West Rail Line\nLight Rail routes 705, 706 and 751\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nYuen Long residents are mainly local ethnic Han with a sizable Hoa immigrants, Vietnamese Chinese from the 1970s to 1990s.\nCirca 2018 there were approximately 800-1,000 people of African origins living in Hong Kong, about half of the total number of African origin people in the SAR.\n\n\n== Education ==\nYuen Long Public Secondary School\nN.T.

        "wiki": "Chengdu (Sichuanese pronunciation: [ts\u02b0\u0259n\u02e8\u02e9tu\u02e5], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [\u0288\u0282\u02b0\u0259\u030c\u014b.t\u00fa] (listen), UK: , US: ), alternatively  romanized  as Chengtu, is a sub-provincial city which serves as the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan. It is one of the three most-populous cities in Western China, the other two being Chongqing and Xi'an. As of 2014, the administrative area housed 14,427,500 inhabitants, the largest in Sichuan, with an urban population of 10,152,632. At the time of the 2010 census, Chengdu was the fifth-most populous agglomeration in China, with 10,484,996 inhabitants in the built-up area including Xinjin County and Deyang's Guanghan City. Chengdu is considered a World City with a \"Beta +\" classification, according to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.Chengdu is located in central Sichuan. The surrounding Chengdu Plain is known as the \"Country of Heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u5e9c\u4e4b\u56fd; pinyin: Ti\u0101nf\u01d4 zhi Gu\u00f3) and the \"Land of Abundance\". Its prehistoric settlers included the Sanxingdui culture. The site of Dujiangyan, an ancient irrigation system, is designated as a World Heritage Site. The Jin River flows through the city.\nFounded by the state of Shu prior to its incorporation into China, Chengdu is unique as a major Chinese settlement that has maintained its name mostly unchanged throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras. It was the capital of Liu Bei's Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms Era, as well as several other local kingdoms during the Middle Ages. During World War II, refugees from eastern China fleeing from the Japanese settled in Chengdu. After the war, Chengdu's importance as a link between Eastern and Western China expanded, with railways built to Chongqing in 1952, and Kunming and Tibet afterwards. In the 1960s, Chengdu became an important centre of China's national defense industry.\nChengdu is now one of the most important economic, financial, commercial, cultural, transportation, and communication centers in Western China. Its economy is diverse, characterized by the machinery, automobile, medicine, food, and information technology industries. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, a hub of Air China and Sichuan Airlines, is one of the 30 busiest airports in the world, and the Chengdu railway station is one of the six biggest in China. Chengdu also hosts many international companies and more than 12 consulates; more than 270 Fortune 500 companies have established branches in Chengdu. Chengdu is the seat of the Western Theatre Command region of the People's Liberation Army. Chengdu will host the FISU Summer World University Games in 2021, an international multi-sport event. It is considered one of the most livable cities in China.Chengdu's culture largely reflects that of its province, Sichuan; in 2011, it was recognized by UNESCO as a city of gastronomy. It is associated with the giant panda, a Chinese national symbol, which inhabits the area of Sichuan; the city is home to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Chengdu is attested in sources dating back to the Warring States period. It has been called the only major city in China to have remained at an unchanged location with an unchanged name throughout the imperial, republican, and communist eras, although it also had other names, for example it was briefly known as \"Xijing\" (Western Capital) in the 17th century. Etymology of the name is unclear. The earliest and most widely known explanation, although generally not accepted by modern scholars, is provided in the 10th-century geographical work Universal Geography of the Taiping Era, which states that the ninth king of Shu's Kaiming dynasty named his new capital Chengdu after a statement by King Tai of Zhou that a settlement needed \"one year to become a town, two to become a city, and three to become a metropolis\". (The character for cheng \u6210 may mean \"turned into\" while du \u90fd can mean either a metropolis or a capital.)\nThe present spelling is based on pinyin romanization; its Postal Map romanization was \"Chengtu\". Its former status as the seat of the Chengdu Prefecture prompted Marco Polo's spellings \"Sindafu\", \"Sin-din-fu\", &c. and the Protestant missionaries' romanization \"Ching-too Foo\".Although the official name of the city has remained (almost) constant, the surrounding area has sometimes taken other names, including \"Yizhou\". Chinese nicknames for the city include the \"Turtle City\", variously derived from the old city walls' shape on a map or a legend that Zhang Yi had planned their course by following a turtle's tracks; the \"Brocade City\", a contraction of the earlier \"City of the Brocade Official\", after an imperial office established under the Western Han; the \"Hibiscus City\", from the hibiscus which King Mengchang of the Later Shu ordered planted upon the city wall during the 10th century.\n\n\n== Logo ==\nThe city logo adopted in 2011 is inspired by the Golden Sun Bird, an ancient relic unearthed in 2001 from the Jinsha Ruins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nArchaeological discoveries at the Sanxingdui and Jinsha sites have established that the area surrounding Chengdu was inhabited over four thousand years ago, in 18\u201310th century BC. At the time of China's Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, it represented a separate ancient bronze-wielding culture which\u2014following its partial sinification\u2014became known to the Chinese as Shu. Shu was conquered by Qin in 316 BC and the settlement re-founded by the Qin general Zhang Yi. (A Chinese legend explains the town's nickname \"Turtle City\" by claiming Zhang planned the course of his city walls by following a turtle's tracks.) Although he had argued against the invasion, the settlement thrived and the additional resources from Sichuan helped enable the First Emperor of Qin to unify the Warring States which had succeeded the Zhou.\n\n\n=== Imperial era ===\n\nUnder the Han, the brocade produced in Chengdu became fashionable and was exported throughout China. A \"Brocade Official\" (\u9326\u5b98; j\u01d0ngu\u0101n) was established to oversee its quality and supply. After the fall of the Eastern Han, Liu Bei ruled Shu, the southwestern of the Three Kingdoms, from Chengdu. His minister Zhuge Liang called the area the \"Land of Abundance\". Under the Tang, Chengdu was considered the second most prosperous city in China after Yangzhou. Both Li Bai and Du Fu lived in the city. Li Bai praised it as \"lying above the empyrean\". The city's present Caotang (\"Grass Hall\") was constructed in 1078 in honor of an earlier, more humble structure of that name erected by Du Fu in 760, the second year of his 4-year stay. The Taoist Qingyang Gong (\"Green Goat Temple\") was built in the 9th century.\nChengdu was the capital of Wang Jian's Former Shu from 907 to 925, when it was conquered by the Later Han. The Later Shu was founded by Meng Zhixiang in 934, with its capital at Chengdu. Its King Mengchang beautified the city by ordering hibiscus to be planted upon the city walls.\nThe Song conquered the city in 965 and used it for the introduction of the first widely used paper money in the world. Su Shi praised it as \"the southwestern metropolis\". At the fall of the Song, a rebel leader set up a short-lived kingdom known as Great Shu (\u5927\u8700, D\u00e0sh\u01d4). Allegedly the Mongols called for the death of a million people in the city but the city's population had less than 30,000 residents (not Chengdu prefecture). The aged males who had not fled were killed while in typical fashion, the women, children and artisans were enslaved and deported. During the Yuan dynasty, most of Sichuan's residents were deported to Hunan during the insurgency of the western ethnic tribes of western Sichuan. Marco Polo visited Chengdu and wrote about the Anshun Bridge or an earlier version of it.At the fall of the Ming, the rebel Zhang Xianzhong established his Great Western Kingdom (\u5927\u897f) with its capital at Chengdu; it lasted only from 1643 to 1646. Zhang was said to have massacred a large number of people in Chengdu and throughout Sichuan.  In any case, Chengdu was said to have become a virtual ghost town frequented by tigers and the depopulation of Sichuan necessitated the resettlement of millions of people from other provinces during the Qing dynasty. Following the Columbian Exchange, the Chengdu Plain became one of China's principal sources of tobacco.  Pi County was considered to have the highest quality in Sichuan, which was the center of the country's cigar and cigarette production, the rest of the country long continuing to consume snuff instead.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1911, Chengdu's branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped trigger the Wuchang Uprising, which led to the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty.During World War II, the capital city of China was forced to move inland from Nanjing to Wuhan in 1937 and from Wuhan to Chengdu, then from Chengdu to Chongqing in 1938, as the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ultimately retreated to Sichuan to escape from the invading Japanese forces. They brought with them into Sichuan business people, workers, and academics who founded many of the industries and cultural institutions which continue to make Chengdu an important cultural and commercial production center.\nChengdu became a military center for the KMT to regroup in the War of Resistance. Chengdu was beyond the reach of the Imperial Japanese ground forces and escort fighter planes. However, the Japanese frequently flew in the then-highly advanced twin-engine long-ranged G3M \"Nell\" medium bombers to conduct massive aerial bombardments of both civilian and military targets in Chongqing and Chengdu. The massed formation of the G3M bombers provided heavy firepower against Chinese fighter planes assigned to the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu, which continued to cause problems for the Japanese attacks.However, in late 1940, unbeknownst to the Americans and European allies, the Imperial Japanese appeared in the skies over Chongqing and Chengdu with the world's most advanced fighter plane at the time: the A6M \"Zero\" fighter that dominated the skies over China against the increasingly obsolete Russian-made Polikarpov I-15/I-153s and I-16s that were the principal fighter planes of the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. This would later prove to be a rude awakening for the Allied forces in the Pacific War following the attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the first American ace fighter pilots of the war and volunteer for the Chinese Nationalist Air Force, Major Wong Sun-shui (nicknamed \"Buffalo\" by his comrades) died as a result of battling the Zero fighters in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nIn 1944, the American XX Bomber Command launched Operation Matterhorn, an ambitious plan to base B-29 Superfortresses in Chengdu and strategically bomb the Japanese Home Islands. The operating base was located in Xinjin Airport in the southwestern part of the Chengdu metropolitan area. Because the operation required a massive airlift of fuel and supplies over the Himalayas, it was not a significant military success, but it did earn Chengdu the distinction of launching the first serious retaliation against the Japanese homeland.\n\nDuring the Chinese Civil War, Chengdu was the last city on the Chinese mainland to be held by the Kuomintang. President Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo directed the defense of the city from Chengdu Central Military Academy until 1949, when the city fell into Communist hands. The People's Liberation Army took the city without any resistance after a deal was negotiated between the People's Liberation Army and the commander of the KMT Army guarding the city. On 10 December the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese government evacuated to Taiwan.The industrial base is very broad, including light and heavy manufacturing, aluminum smelting and chemicals. The textile industry remains important, with cotton and wool milling added to the traditional manufacturing of silk brocade and satin.\nChengdu is the headquarters of the Chengdu Military Region. Until the end of the year 2015, due to the revocation of military reform in Chengdu, the West Theater is founded and headquarters was stationed in Chengdu.\nThe Chengdu Tianfu District Great City is a sustainable planned city that will be outside of Central Chengdu, and is expected to be completely built later in the decade. The city is also planned to be self-sustaining, with every residence being a two-minute walk from a park.\n\n\n==== The Great City ====\nRecently, Chengdu overtook Shenzhen, China's technology hub, as the best-performing Chinese economy. The city has surged in population in the last two decades. Investments into a Europe-Chengdu Express Railway have been made, providing even more opportunity for the city to grow. As a way to preserve farmland and accommodate the growing population of Chengdu, China is building a hyper-dense satellite city centered around a central mass-transit hub called the Great City where any destination within the city is within a 15-minute walk. This proto-type city is intended to provide affordable, high-quality lifestyle, which provides people-oriented spaces that does not require a car to navigate.Their current urban-planning focus in the city of Chengdu is to make the city 'a city within a park' rather than creating parks within a city. The Great City falls in line with the Chengdu 'park city' initiative, prioritizing the environment, public space and quality of life. It will consist of 15% park and green space and be situated on a 1.3 km2 (0.50 sq mi) area. Although 25% of the space will be dedicated to roads, one half of the roads will be pedestrian-oriented. This transit system provides direct transport to Chengdu itself. It is expected that the city will consume 48% less energy than cities of similar size.The goal of the 'park city' project is to allow a city like Chengdu to compete with Beijing and Shanghai without stripping the city of its character. The city of Chengdu is already known for its focus on quality of life, which includes affordable housing, good public schools, trees and bike lanes. However, this project is considered an urban renewal project, and to carry out this project, demolitions and forced evictions are occurring. The Great City may be, in part, compensation for urban renewal project going on in Chengdu. The Great City fulfills the need for affordable housing as Chengdu carries out demolitions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe vast plain on which Chengdu is located has an elevation ranging from 450 to 720 metres (1,480 to 2,360 feet).\nNorthwest Chengdu is bordered by the high and steep Longmen Mountains in the north-west and in the west by the Qionglai Mountains, the elevation of which exceeds 3,000 m (9,800 ft) and includes Miao Jiling (5,364 m, 17,598 ft) and Xiling Snow Mountain (5,164 m, 16,942 ft). The western mountainous area is also home to a large primitive forest with abundant biological resources and a giant panda habitat. East of Chengdu stands the low Longquan Mountains and the west bordering area of the hilly land of middle reaches of Min River, an area noted by several converging rivers. Since ancient times, Chengdu has been known as \"the Abundant Land\" owing to its fertile soil, favorable climate, and novel Dujiangyan Irrigation System.\nChengdu is located at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin and sits on the Chengdu Plain; the dominating terrain is plains. The prefecture ranges in latitude from 30\u00b0 05' to 31\u00b0 26' N, while its longitude ranges from 102\u00b0 54' to 104\u00b0 53' E, stretching for 192 kilometres (119 mi) from east to west and 166 km (103 mi) south to north, administering 12,390 square kilometres (4,780 sq mi) of land. Neighbouring prefectures are Deyang (NE), Ziyang (SE), Meishan (S), Ya'an (SW), and the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (N). The urban area, with an elevation of 500 m (1,600 ft), features a few rivers, three of them being the Jin, Fu, and Sha Rivers. Outside of the immediate urban area, the topography becomes more complex: to the east lies the Longquan Mountains (\u9f99\u6cc9\u5c71\u8109) and the Penzhong Hills (\u76c6\u4e2d\u4e18\u9675); to the west lie the Qionglai Mountains, which rise to 5,364 m (17,598 ft) in Dayi County. The lowest point in Chengdu Prefecture, at 378 m (1,240 ft), lies in the southeast in Jintang County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nChengdu has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) and is largely warm with high relative humidity all year. It has four distinct seasons, with moderate rainfall concentrated mainly in the warmer months, and relieved from both sweltering summers and freezing winters. The Qin Mountains (Qinling) to the far north help shield the city from cold Siberian winds in the winter; because of this, the short winter is milder than in the Lower Yangtze. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in January is 5.6 \u00b0C (42.1 \u00b0F), and snow is rare but there are a few periods of frost each winter. The summer is hot and humid, but not to the extent of the \"Three Furnaces\" cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, and Nanjing, all of which lie in the Yangtze basin. The 24-hour daily mean temperature in July and August is around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), with afternoon highs sometimes reaching 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F); sustained heat as found in much of eastern China is rare. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. Chengdu also has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, with less sunshine annually than much of Northern Europe, and most days are overcast even if without rain. This is especially so in the winter months, when it is nearly continuously grey, compounded by the poor air quality. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 16 percent in December to 38 percent in August, the city receives 1,073 hours of bright sunshine annually. Spring (March\u2013April) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (October\u2013November). The annual mean is 16.27 \u00b0C (61.3 \u00b0F), and extremes have ranged from \u22124.6 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F) to 37.5 \u00b0C (99.5 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nChengdu is a sub-provincial city which has served as the capital of Sichuan since Chongqing's restoration to provincial status in 1997. It has direct jurisdiction over 12 districts, 5 county-level cities and 3 counties:\n\nTianfu New Area\nChengdu Economic and Technological Development Zone\nChengdu Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone\nChengdu Tianfu Software Park\nChengdu Export Processing Zone\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nAs of July 2013, the world's largest building in terms of floor area, the New Century Global Centre is located in the city. The 100-metre-tall (330 ft) structure is 500 by 400 metres (1,600 by 1,300 ft) in size with 1,700,000 square metres (18,000,000 sq ft) of floor area. The centre houses retail outlets, a 14-theater cinema, offices, hotels, a water park with artificial beach and waves and a Mediterranean-style village comprising a large 5-star hotel, a 164 yards (150 m)-long LED screen, a skating rink and a 15,000-spot parking area.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ancient fortress wall ===\nThe ancient fortress wall of Chengdu, 10 metres (33 ft) high and 11 km (6.8 mi) long, was built during the Qing Empire Era. Surrounding the city, the wall's bottom measures 10 m (33 ft) wide while the top measures 6 m (20 ft) wide, almost equivalent to the width of a street. 8,122 crenels, four octagons and four turrets were built on the wall.\nFour gates were constructed on all sides of the wall, with hibiscus trees planted outside.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAccording to the 2010 census, the municipality had 14,047,625 inhabitants, of whom 8,311,752 reside in the city, considered as 11 urban and suburban administrative districts. The built-up (or metro) area was home to 10,484,996 inhabitants including the 11 previous districts plus Guanghan City (in Deyang) and Xinjin County being urbanized quickly.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 18.1 million.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nIn 2006, China Daily named Chengdu China's fourth-most-livable city.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nSome of China's most important literature comes from Chengdu. The city has been home to literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Fu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Tang dynasty; Li Bai and Du Fu, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, \"A harvest year accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs.\"\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nDuring the period of the Five Dynasties, Huang Quan, a painter in Chengdu, initiated the Fine-Brush Flower-and-Bird Painting school with other painters. At that time, \"Hanlin Painting Academy\" was the earliest royal academy in China.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nChengdu contains official, Roman Catholic and Protestant congregations, some of which are underground churches.\n15 October 1696: The Roman Catholic Church established as Apostolic Vicariate of Szechwan\nIn 1890, the Methodist Missions of Canada was searching for more stations in Asia. In February 1891, Dr. Virgil Hart, who had been Superintendent of the New York Methodist Mission Society of Central China recommended that Chengtu be its first Mission sight. During the meeting, it was proposed he lead this contingency; having built western hospitals, Boy's and Girl's schools at Missions he established on the Yangtze and Gan Rivers from 1866 \u2013 1888. On 9 May 1891 Dr. Virgil Hart arrived in Chengtu and two weeks later bought a home and had it subdivided into living quarters and a dispensary, for the later arriving Missionary staff to move into.\nOn 24 June 1892, the doors of Chengtu's first Protestant Mission Headquarters were opened with over one thousand people of the community attending. The first Methodist religious service was held the following Sunday with only several attendants. The first western dispensary in Sichuan was opened 3 November 1892 with sixteen patients seeking care. The mission site became so popular that a larger space was secured near Chengtu's East Gate in the spring of 1893. This site is where the city's first Methodist church and hospital were built. These were later razed by rioting Chinese in 1895 and the Mission staff retreated to Chongqing and later Shanghai to escape the marauders. Dr. Virgil Hart traveled to Peking to demand redress and full payment of retribution was collected from Sichuan Viceroy Liu Ping Chang. The mission compound was quickly rebuilt only to be destroyed once more in the riots of 1901. These were rebuilt a third time and later missionaries would relocate and expand the Boys' and Girls' Schools just south of the city, dedicating the Divinity College as Hart College in 1914; a part of the West China Union University, that is now Sichuan University and the West China School of Medicine (Huaxiyida).The Methodist Church near the East Gate would be closed by the CCP and became a grain storage facility. It was reopened as a Methodist church in the mid-1980s.\nIn December 2018 the authorities attempted to close a 500-member underground church: \"The Early Rain Covenant Church\", led by Pastor Wang Yi. Over 100 members of the church were arrested including the pastor and his wife. The church's kindergarten and theological college were raided and the church's media outlets were closed down. Before his arrest, church member Li Yingqiang declared: \"Even if we are down to our last five, worship and gatherings will still go on because our faith is real. [\u2026] Persecution is a price worth paying for the Lord\". Police are said to have told one member that the church had been declared an illegal organisation. Chinese media were banned from reporting the events. Video footage which found its way onto western social media showed arrests and photographs alleged to be of injuries inflicted by the police. From a photo of Ms. Jiang's detention warrant it appears that the authorities have charged the church's leaders with \"inciting subversion of state power\", which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe saying \"Shu opera towers above all other performances in the world\" reflects the achievement of Sichuan opera and Zaju (an ancient form of comedic drama involving dancing, singing, poetry, and miming). In the city, the first named opera \"Bullfighting\" was written in the Warring States Period. The first detailed recorded opera was staged in the royal court of Shu Kingdom during the Three Kingdom Period. China's first clearly recorded Zaju was also performed in Chengdu. Tombs of witty Han dynasty poets were excavated in Chengdu. And face-changing masks and fire breathing remain hallmarks of the Sichuan opera.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe native language in Chengdu is Sichuanese, otherwise referred as Sichuan dialect. More precisely, \"Chengdu Dialect\" (\u6210\u90fd\u8bdd/\u6210\u90fd\u65b9\u8a00) is widely used in lieu of \"Sichuanese\" due to the largely different accents of Sichuanese speakers residing elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Culinary art and tea culture ===\n\nThe distinct characteristic of Sichuan cuisine is the use of spicy chilies and peppercorns. Local dishes include Mapo doufu, Chengdu Hot pot, and Dan Dan Mien. Mapo Doufu and Dan Dan Mien contain Sichuan peppers. An article by the Los Angeles Times (2006) called Chengdu \"China's party city\" for its carefree lifestyle. Chengdu has more tea houses and bars than Shanghai despite having less than half the population. Chengdu's tea culture dates back over a thousand years, including its time as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road.\nCommon snacks in Chengdu include noodles, wontons, dumplings, pastries, tangyuan (sweet rice balls), drinks, salads and soups.\nChengdu is an officially recognised UNESCO City of Gastronomy.\n\n\n==== Teahouse ====\nTea houses are ubiquitous in the city and range from ornate traditional establishments with bamboo furniture to simple modern tea houses. Teas on offer include jasmine, longjing and biluochun tea. Tea houses are popular venues for playing mahjong. Some larger tea houses offer live entertainment such as Sichuan opera performances.\n\n\n==== Hot pot ====\nHot pot is a traditional Sichuanese food, made by putting vegetables, fish, or meat into a specially-made spiced soup. Chengdu residents eat hot pot often, sometimes inviting friends to go with them to one of the many hot pot restaurants that are widely distributed throughout Chengdu. Hot pot is a typical part of Chengdu residents' daily diet.\n\n\n=== Mahjong ===\n\nMahjong has been an essential part of most local peoples' lives. After every day' s working, people gather their friends in their home or in the tea houses on the street to play Mahjong. On sunny days, local people like to play Mahjong on the sidewalks to enjoy the sunshine and also the time with friends. Almost every person aims to play Mahjong with money.\nMahjong is the most popular entertainment choice among locals for several reasons. Chengdu locals have simplified the rules and made it easier to play as compared to, Cantonese Mahjong. Also, Mahjong in Chengdu is a way to meet old friends and to strengthen family relationships. In fact, many business people negotiate deals while playing Mahjong. Furthermore, the elderly like to play Mahjong because they believe Mahjong makes them think and prevents dementia.\n\n\n=== Rural tourism: Nong Jia Le ===\nChengdu claims to have first practiced the modern business model of 'Nong Jia Le' (Happy Rural Homes). It refers to the practice of suburban and rural residents converting their houses into restaurants, hotels and entertainment spaces in order to attract city dwellers.\nNong Jia Le features different styles and price levels and have been thriving around Chengdu. They provide gateways for city dwellers to escape the city, offer delicious and affordable home-made dishes, and provide mahjong facilities.\nSome of the most popular ones are located in Sansheng Village east of Chengdu, and Nongke Village in Pidu District (\u6b27\u7279\u7f8e\u5bb6), northwest of Chengdu.\n\n\n=== Customs and festivals ===\n\n\n==== Grand Temple Fair ====\nChengdu's annual Grand Temple Fair is held every year during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) in Wuhou Shrine, Jinli, the Culture Park, and several other city parks. The 15-day-long festival showcases both traditional Sichuan folk art and modern fashions of the city. Food stalls on site offer over 100 varieties of freshly made local snacks.\n\n\n==== Lantern Festival ====\nChengdu's annual Lantern Festival is held every year during the Spring Festival in Tazishan Park in the eastern part of Chengdu. Lanterns of different designs and themes are on display with traditional art performances including Sichuan opera, acrobatics shows, and local talk shows.\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Water Releasing Festival ====\nThe Dujiangyan Water-Releasing Festival takes place on 5 April each year in Du Jiang Yan, 58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu. Residents dress up in ancient costumes and read elegies for Li Bing and his sons, in order to honor them for their contribution to the irrigation project they built over 2,000 years ago.\n\n\n==== Huanglongxi Fire Dragon Festival ====\nFire Dragon Festival of HuangLongXi is celebrated from the 2nd to the 15th day of the first lunar month of each new year.\nThe festival originated from South Song dynasty (1127\u20131279 AD). Celebrations include lighting paper dragons, a lion dance, floating lanterns on the water, and various street activities.\n\n\n==== South China Snow and Ice Festival ====\nThe South China Snow and Ice Festival takes place from January to March at the Xiling Snow Mountain Ski Resort, 95 kilometres (59 miles) west of downtown Chengdu. The festival is popular among locals, especially children, since it rarely snows in Chengdu and people relish the sight of snow. A large variety of snow activities are offered during the festival.\n\n\n== Home of the giant panda ==\n\nThe giant panda, a Chinese national treasure, is one of the rarest animals in the world. The total number is estimated to be 1,500, including those living in the wild, 80 percent of which are in Sichuan Province.A breeding center for giant pandas called Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding was founded in the north suburbs of Chengdu. It is the only one of its kind in the world that's located in a metropolitan area. In order to better protect wild giant pandas, Chengdu has established nature reserves in Dujiangyan City, Chongzhou City, and Dayi County. Sichuan Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, the biggest of its kind in the world, is only 130 km (81 mi) outside Chengdu. After the Wenchuan earthquake, most of it was moved to Ya'an.\nAiming for the conservation of national wildlife, Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has developed a Chengdu Field Research Center for Giant Pandas of CRBGPB-\"Panda Valley\". This center creates a natural habitat, possessing up to 700 species of animals and plants for the pandas and provides them a natural environment without human disturbance.\nThe western world came to know giant pandas only after a French missionary named David first encountered this species in Sichuan in 1869. Now, the somewhat clumsy giant panda is a symbol representing the World Wildlife Fund. They are also a messenger of friendly communication between Chengdu and international cities. Currently, giant pandas are also reared in U.S.A, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Thailand as well as Mexico.\nChengdu has established the world-renowned breeding and research base for giant pandas, which attracts almost 100,000 visitors each year. Covering tens of hectares with bamboo groves and a native-like habitat, the base is the only one of its kind located in an urban area. A museum is open to the public throughout the year.\nOn 11 January 2012, six captive-bred pandas were released to a \"semi-wild\" environment in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. Scientists believe that success in the reintroduction project would potentially help save the endangered giant panda. Retired NBA basketball star and animal activist Yao Ming attended the ceremony.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== World natural and cultural heritage sites ===\n\n\n==== Mount Qingcheng ====\nMount Qingcheng is amongst the most important centres of Taoism (Daoism) in China. It is situated in the suburbs of Dujiangyan City and connected to downtown Chengdu 70 km (43 mi) away by the Cheng-Guan Expressway.\nWith its peak 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, Mount Qingcheng enjoys a cool climate, but remains a lush green all year round and surrounded by hills and waterways. Mount Qingcheng's Fujian Temple, Tianshi Cave, and Shizu Hall are some of the existing more well-known Taoist holy sites. Shangqing Temple is noted for an evening phosphorescent glow locally referred to as \"holy lights\".\n\n\n==== Dujiangyan Irrigation System ====\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation System (58 km (36 mi) away from Chengdu proper) is the oldest existing irrigation project in the world with a history of over 2000 years diverting water without a dam to distribute water and filter sand with an inflow-quantity control.

It is the largest remaining continuous habitat for giant pandas and home to more than 80 percent of the world's wild giant pandas. Globally speaking, it is also the most abundant temperate zone of greenery. The reserves of the habitat are 100\u2013200 km (62\u2013124 mi) away from Chengdu.\nThe Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries are the most well-known of their kind in the world, with Wolong Nature Reserve, generally considered as the \"homeland of pandas\". It is a core habitat with unique natural conditions, complicated landforms, and a temperate climate with diverse wildlife. Siguniang Mountain, sometimes called the \"Oriental Alpine\" is approximately 230 km (140 mi) away from Chengdu, and is composed of four adjacent peaks of the Traversal Mountain Range. Among the four peaks, the fourth and highest stands 6,250 m (20,510 ft) above sea level, and is perpetually covered by snow.\n\n\n=== Culture of poetry and the Three Kingdoms ===\n\n\n==== Wuhou Shrine ====\nWuhou Shrine (Temple of Marquis Wu) is perhaps the most influential museum of Three Kingdoms relics in China. It was built in the Western Jin period (265\u2013316) in the honor of Zhuge Liang, the famous military and political strategist who was Prime Minister of the Shu Han State during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280). The Shrine highlights the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple and the Hall of Liu Bei (founder of the Shu Han state), along with statues of other historical figures of Shu Han, as well as cultural relics like stone inscriptions and tablets. The Hui Mausoleum of Liu Bei represents a unique pattern of enshrining both the emperor and his subjects in the same temple, a rarity in China.\n\n\n==== Du Fu thatched cottage ====\n\nDu Fu was one of the most noted Tang dynasty poets; during the Lushan-Shi Siming Rebellion, he left Xi'an (then Chang'an) to take refuge in Chengdu. With the help from his friends, the thatched cottage was built along the Huanhua Stream in the west suburbs of Chengdu, where Du Fu spent four years of his life and produced more than 240 now-famous poems. During the Song dynasty, people started to construct gardens and halls on the site of his thatched cottage to honor his life and memory. Currently, a series of memorial buildings representing Du Fu's humble life stand on the river bank, along with a large collection of relics and various editions of his poems.\n\n\n=== Ancient Shu civilization ===\n\n\n==== Jinsha Ruins ====\nThe Jinsha Ruins are the first significant archeological discovery in China of the 21st century and were selected in 2006 as a \"key conservation unit\" of the nation.

It is believed that it was constructed during the East Han period and has appeared in written records since the Tang dynasty. It was destroyed during the Ming dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1607, the ninth year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, it was rebuilt.\n\n\n==== Qingyang Taoist Temple ====\nLocated in the western part of Chengdu, Qingyang Temple ('Green Goat Temple') is not only the largest and oldest Taoist temple in the city, but also the largest Taoist temple in Southwest China. The only existing copy of \"Daozang Jiyao\", a collection of classic Taoist scriptures, is preserved in the temple.\nAccording to history, Qingyang Temple was the place where Lao Tzu preached his famous Dao De Jing to his disciple, Ying Xi.\n\n\n=== Featured streets and historic towns ===\n\n\n==== The Wide and Narrow Lanes ====\nThe Wide and Narrow Lanes (Kuan Xiangzi and Zhai Xiangzi) were first built during the Qing dynasty for Manchu soldiers.

According to legend, the Shu Han emperor Liu Shan dropped his jade belt into a well when he passed through this small town. Thus, the town was named 'lost belt' (\u843d\u5e26). It later evolved into its current name \u6d1b\u5e26 with the same pronunciation, but a different first character.\nLuodai Historic Town is one of the five major Hakka settlements in China.

Three of the roads supported the east part of the city, the other two led to the south. It established the foundation of the Eastern and Southern sub-centers of Chengdu. The two major sub-centers determined people's eastward and southward living trends. Large numbers of buildings appeared around the east and south of the 2nd Ring Road. The Shahe River renovation project together with Jin River project also set off a fashion for people living by the two rivers. It was said that the map of Chengdu should update every three months.In 2000, dozens of commercial real estate projects also appeared. While promoting the real estate market, the Chinese government encouraged citizens to buy their own houses by providing considerable subsidies. Houses were included in commodities.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nChengdu is served by the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport located in Shuangliu County 16 km (9.9 mi) southwest of downtown. Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the busiest airport in Central and Western China and the nation's fourth-busiest airport in 2018, with a total passenger traffic of 53 million in 2018. Shuangliu Airport is one of the two core hubs for Air China, together with Beijing, as well as the main hub and headquarters for Sichuan Airlines.

The Chengdu Railway Bureau manages the railway system of Sichuan Province, Chongqing City, Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province. Chengdu has four main freight railway stations. Among them, the Chengdu North Marshalling Station is one of the largest marshalling stations in Asia. Since April 2013, companies are able to ship goods three times a week (initially only once a week) to Europe on trains originating from Chengdu Qingbaijiang Station bound for \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. It is the first express cargo train linking China and Europe, taking 12 days to complete the full journey.\nThere are three major passenger stations servicing Chengdu: Chengdu Railway Station (commonly referred to as the \"North Station\"), Chengdu South Railway Station (ChengduNan) and Chengdu East Railway Station (ChengduDong). In addition, Chengdu West Railway Station is scheduled to open by 2030.Chengdu is the terminus of the Baoji-Chengdu railway, the Chengdu-Chongqing railway, the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Chengdu-Dazhou railway, the Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Lanzhou railway, the Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway, the Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway, and the Chengdu-Dujiangyan high-speed railway.\nThe Chengdu\u2013Dujiangyan high-speed railway is a high-speed rail line connecting Chengdu with the satellite city of Dujiangyan and the Mountain Qingcheng World Heritage Site.

There will also be a road that connects Longquan Town to Longquan Lake; it is connected to the Chengdu\u2013Jianyang Expressway and hence shorten the journey by 10 km (6.2 mi). By the end of 2008, there are ten expressways, connecting the centre of Chengdu to its suburbs. The expressways are Chenglin Expressway, extensions of Guanghua Avenue, Shawan Line, and an expressway from Chengdu to Heilongtan.\nThe toll-free Chengjin Expressway in the east of Chengdu is 38.7 km (24.0 mi) long. After it opens to the public, it will take only about half an hour to drive from central Chengdu to Jintang, half the time of the current journey.\nThe expressway between Chengdu to Heilongtan (Chengdu section), going to the south of the city, is 42 km (26 mi) long. It is also toll-free and a journey from downtown Chengdu to Heilongtan will only take half an hour.\nThe extension of Guanghua Avenue, going towards the west of the city.

Bus cards are available that permit free bus transfers for three hours.\n\n\n=== River transport ===\nHistorically, the Jin River was used for boat traffic in and out of Chengdu. However, due to the size of the river itself and the reduced water depth over time, the Brocade River is no longer capable of carrying any type of water traffic. Therefore, Chengdu has no direct access to the Yangtze River or any other larger river. However, to ensure that Chengdu's goods have access to the river efficiently, inland port cities of Yibin and Luzhou\u2014both of which are reachable from Chengdu within hours by expressways\u2014on the Yangtze have commenced large-scale port infrastructure development. As materials and equipment for the rebuilding of northern Sichuan are sent in from the East Coast to Sichuan, these ports will see significant increases in throughput.\n\n\n== Education ==\nChengdu is home to the greatest number of universities and research institutes in Southwestern China.

The Chinese government is aiming to increase that by 15 percent every year. The nation's tennis market has reached $4 billion annually, according to Tom Cannon, a professor and sports finance expert at the University of Liverpool Management School in England.\nThe women's tour upgraded the China Open in Beijing to become the only combined event with the men's tour in Asia.

          "I went by car, so I won\u2019t take the way to my review if going there by public transport, I guess it must be not easy. The entrance cost less than 20 rmb/person at weekend. The beachside is very wide and long. Most of chinese gathered at one part, after entrance, but if you\u2019ll go",
          "Xichong (and it\u2019s sister beach, Dong Chong), are the best beaches in Shenzhen (though not in the area). This place is most popular with Shenzhen surfers, expats, and couples taking engagement photos. The scenery is really nice, and the distance from downtown keeps the worst of",
          "It's still worth to recommend compared with others,even it was my 2nd visit. We arrived around beach 3.00 PM. There're 3 entrance to get in the beach,we choose the No.3 Beach because here there's more place for parking. We bought 2 tickets total cost 40Yuan ($5.88),as the kid",
          "Not so clean, however it's the best of the Shenzhen beaches by far. Far away from city need 1 hour on the bus easily. Need hired bus or didi. Take cash as mobile service for wechat pay may not work. Still you definitely need to visit",
          "Just want to make clear this is not really a beach destination, so the \"very good\" is compared to other beaches you may find in China. Xichong Beach is accessible by private car, taxi or bus, about 1 1/2 hour drive from central Shenzhen. You have to pay a little to enter the",
          "We travelled here on a Monday, mainly to avoid the weekend hordes. My husband and I are avid beach goers and have been to Dameisha, as well as almost all the beaches in Hong Kong. We decided to check this one out ourselves after hearing so many different opinions. First off, the",
          "The best hiking route I have ever taken in China. If possible, make sure you pick a cloudy day so you won't get burned that much. Take the boat!",
          "clean water, sandy beach, green nature... Also a small cafe run by an american making good pizzas, european beers and also can rent wind surfs. itd ideal for a day or a weekend....",
          "One of the few surfing beaches near Shenzhen. Clean water and beach (sometimes because of the crowds). I go there whenever there are waves and when it does break the surf can be good. Whilst there find the Secret Spot Cafe for some great Western food.",
          "think long long beach, practically deserted with clear blue waters and delicious restaurant. Small places and nice horse riding place",
          "Nice sandy beaches, warm water and not as busy as Dameisha beach. It's a bit far out of town and traffic can be bad during national holidays.",
          "I highly recomend Xicong Beach which is located about an hour east from Shenzhen. You and your friends, family and/or partner can have some relaxing days full of sunshine, fresh air, nice waves, good food and relaxation here. My friend runs one of the newest Ghuesthouses",
          "I've seen this beach beautiful and welcoming on a Friday evening. Turquoise water, just enough surf and clean sands. I visited again on a Sunday afternoon and it was disgusting - I couldn't believe it was the same beach. Trash everywhere and at least 3 dozen pigs feet washed",
          "I like sunny days but I don't like rainy days. Fortunately, the weather is warm. Sea water is relatively clean, so, overall is a good experience.",
          "We took a van from Nan Ao Main Station sharing with a little family at 10rmb per person. Upon arriving at our cabins and checking in we ran down to the sea. So many people and a lot of garbage, however for China it wasnt bad at all. The beach is really long and there is a lot to",
          "The best time get there is on Friday night for check in the local hotel , on Saturday and Sunday, you will hit a lot of traffic on the road ! The beach is about 6 miles long with the most clean sea water from the big ocean , enjoy the different foods from the local restaurants",
          "Came on a work trip. Quite difficult to get to without a coach or bus as it's about 45 mins outside of xiaomeisha. Lovely sand beach. Not too busy. Can get a shaded tent area for 200 per hour. Beach was quite clean. Got a speedboat to Lovers Island which is about 5 mins",
          "First problem is the inconvenience of going from Futian. You need to pick a few buses to get there and it takes about 2 hrs to reach. The second is the amount of people there in summer... which implies lots of trash and little space to swim. Plastic bags in the w\u00e1ter, disposable",
          "was a long journey to get there but was greeted by a long beach without many tourists. Plenty of eateries to choose from serving fresh seafood and local fare.",
          "We Hike from DongChong to Xichong! amazing views! When we arrive to Xichong we found a beautiful beach, little bit crowded, but cheap hotel and showers!",

          "Place is not bad, beach is spacious, enviroment is not the best you can see but is also pleasent and has its moments. HOWEVER, reaching there on weekends takes up to 3 hours from Shenzhen (nanshan even worse), for such time is easier to pass custom to Hong Kong and in similar",
          "Beach by itself could be beautiful place but Chinese people don't care, they make garbage from the beach!!! Trash everywhere, it's even scary to step because can be glass or something else... I have no comments, really sad about that place! Hope they will change their behavior",
          "A few years ago it was the place to go as it was not as well know, but now its crowded and dirty so you're better off heading over to a beach in Hong Kong.",
          "OK- While Xichong is by no means a wonder of the world, there have been multiple occasions where I've had to stop and take in its beauty. I can most distinctly recall one day where I was playing in an ultimate frisbee tournament and the sky momentarily became grey. What may",
          "If this is the best beach in Shenzhen and Guangdong, then the standards are very low. Visited on an average weekend in the summer, this beach was very dirty and fairly crowded, despite being an enormous pain to get to. Locals are happy to eat and leave the trash (bones, rinds,",
          "Yes I guess it is one of the best beaches in Guangdong but still dirty and not very pleasant. It is nice for a couple of hours but also nice to leave again. Usually too many People and therefore also quite dirty.",

          "We were very excited as it was said to be among the \"8 best beaches in China\" but were disappointed when we arrived. The beach itself is pretty with a 4-5km stretch, however these ppl don't know how to maintain it, leaving garbage on the beaches (a LOT!), i stepped on many beer",

        "quote": "Hong Kong Disneyland (Chinese: \u9999\u6e2f\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c\u6a02\u5712) (also known as HK Disneyland or HKDL) is a theme park located on reclaimed land in Penny\\'s Bay, Lantau Island. It is located inside the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and it is owned and managed by Hong Kong International Theme Parks. It is the largest theme park in Hong Kong, followed by Ocean Park Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland was opened to visitors on Monday, 12 September 2005 at 13:00 HKT. Disney attempted to avoid problems of cultural backlash by incorporating Chinese culture, customs and traditions when designing and building the resort, including adherence to the rules of feng shui. Notably, a bend was put in a walkway near the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort entrance so good qi energy would not flow into the South China Sea.The park consists of seven themed areas: Main Street, U.S.A., Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land. The theme park\\'s cast members speak Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Guide maps are printed in traditional and simplified Chinese as well as English.\\nThe park has a daily capacity of 34,000 visitors \u2014 the lowest of all Disneyland parks. The park attracted 5.2 million visitors in its first year, below its target of 5.6 million. Visitor numbers fell 20% in the second year to 4 million, inciting criticisms from local legislators. However, the park attendance jumped by 8% in the third year, attracting a total of 4.5 million visitors in 2007. In 2009, the park attendance again increased by 2% to 4.8 million visitors. The attendance continued to surge and received 5.23 million guests in the 2009/2010 fiscal year. Since the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland, the theme park has hosted over 25 million guests. According to AECOM and TEA, Hong Kong Disneyland is the 13th most visited theme park in the world in 2013, with 7.4 million visitors.Majority-owned (53%) by the Hong Kong Government but managed by Disney, the park first turned an annual net profit of HK$109 million (US$13.97 million) for the year ended 29 September 2012. However, it has operated at an increasing loss in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Hong Kong Disneyland currently occupies 27.5 hectares (68 acres) and hosts 6 million to 7 million visitors annually. The park capacity will increase to handle up to 10 million visitors annually over a 15-year expansion period.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\n\\nPenny\\'s Bay was filled in to provide land for the construction of Hong Kong Disneyland. The bay was previously undeveloped except for the Cheoy Lee Shipyard, which opened in the 1960s.Chief Executive of Hong Kong Tung Chee Hwa was instrumental in introducing the Disneyland project to Hong Kong. When the SARS epidemic devastated the city\\'s economy in 2003, it was hoped that the new Disneyland would help boost confidence in Hong Kong\\'s tourism industry.Hong Kong Disneyland had one of the shortest construction periods of any Disneyland-style theme park. On 12 January 2003, more than 400 guests celebrated the groundbreaking of Hong Kong Disneyland after the finishing of land reclamation in Penny\\'s Bay. The audience included Tung Chee Hwa; Michael D. Eisner, former chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company; Bob Iger, president of The Walt Disney Company; and Jay Rasulo, former president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. On 23 September 2004, a special \"castle topping ceremony\" was held in the park to commemorate the placing of the tallest turret on Sleeping Beauty Castle. Hong Kong Disneyland was officially opened to the public on 12 September 2005 by then Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, Chief Executive Officer Michael Eisner, President Bob Iger. Beijing offered its significant support by sending Zeng Qinghong as Vice President of the People\\'s Republic of China. In order to help Hong Kong Disneyland grow, Beijing also deliberately slowed down the development of Shanghai Disney Resort, which was first planned for the early 2000s.\\n\\n\\n=== Expansion ===\\n\\nIn January 2012, Hong Kong Disneyland has been in the progress of negotiating with the Government of Hong Kong to invest its HK$5 billion profit for new attractions. Further details of the expansion would be announced within a 12-month period from January 2012. A shopping complex and new hotels would be taken into consideration for the new expansion plan.\\nIn Hong Kong financial secretary John Tsang\\'s 2013\u201314 budget speech, he announced that a new night time parade: \"Disney Paint The Night Parade\", as well as a themed area featuring characters from the Marvel Universe, will be built in Hong Kong Disneyland. On 8 October 2013 then Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Thomas O. Staggs confirmed the development of the Iron Man Experience.On 17 February 2014, Hong Kong Disneyland announced its 2012\u201313 financial results as well as a plan for the third hotel at the resort. The third hotel would be the largest hotel at the resort, featuring 750 rooms with an adventure and exotic theme, and would cost HK$4.26 billion to build. The third hotel, Disney Explorers Lodge, opened on 30 April 2017.Hong Kong Disneyland was also built with the space for a second park directly across from the entrance to the current park. Disney has not yet announced that the second park is in development. Land is also available for additional hotels other than the three current, but the common thought is that the second park will be built before a fourth hotel.On 22 November 2016, the Walt Disney Company and the Hong Kong Government announced plans for a multi-year, HK$10.9 billion expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland. The proposed expansion includes a Frozen-themed area (announced for 2021), a Marvel-themed area (opening in phases from 2018 to 2023), a redesigned Sleeping Beauty Castle and hub (announced for 2020), a reimagined attraction (announced for 2021), a new Moana stage show (announced for 2018), and live entertainment.On 24 May 2018, Hong Kong Disneyland opened the first project part of the multi-year expansion: Moana: a Homecoming Celebration, an atmosphere stage show performed daily at the newly built Jungle Junction venue in Adventureland. The park also gave more information on the coming projects as well as the revised dates for these projects: the shooting dark ride Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, replacing Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, opened in 2019 and the new expanded castle will be unveiled in 2020, in time for the park\\'s 15th anniversary. Park officials also confirmed the rumors that the future Frozen-themed area will feature a copy of Epcot\\'s Frozen Ever After and a family roller coaster named Wandering Oaken\u2019s Sliding Sleighs, replacing the previously announced Dancing Sleighs ride, and that the area will open in 2021.\\nOn January 26, 2020, the park temporarily closed until further notice due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic along with Ocean Park Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland Park. It remained closed for nearly five months and reopened on June 18, 2020, becoming the second Disney park to reopen after Shanghai Disneyland. It reopened with similar strict rules as Shanghai Disneyland\\'s with limited guest attendance, social distancing, temperature checks, and wearing of face masks. However, it was later announced that Hong Kong Disneyland would close again on July 15, 2020 due to a heavy upsurge in domestic cases. \\n\\n\\n=== Timeline ===\\n\\n\\n== Park layout ==\\n\\nThe park, partially in Islands District and Tsuen Wan District, is divided into \"lands\" (themed areas) and well-concealed backstage areas. On entering a land, a guest is completely immersed in a themed environment and is unable to see or hear any other realm. The idea behind this was to develop theatrical \"stages\" with seamless passages from one land to the next. The public areas occupy approximately 27.4 hectares (68 acres). When the park initially opened, it consisted of only four themed areas instead of the traditional five lands:\\n\\nMain Street, U.S.A., designed to resemble an early 20th-century Midwest town;\\nAdventureland, featuring jungle-themed adventures;\\nFantasyland, bringing to life characters and places from Disney\\'s movies for children;\\nTomorrowland, an optimistic vision of the future.On 30 June 2009, Donald Tsang, the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong, announced that the expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland had been approved by the Executive Council. The park received three new themed lands \u2014 Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point and Toy Story Land \u2014 all located outside the Disneyland Railroad track, south of the current area.\\n\\nToy Story Land, based on the Disney\u00b7Pixar film series Toy Story. Opened 18 November 2011.\\nGrizzly Gulch, reminiscing an abandoned mining town set amidst mountains and woods. Opened 14 July 2012.\\nMystic Point, heart of a dense, uncharted rain forest where supernatural events take place. Opened 17 May 2013.On 2 May 2017, the Executive Council approved another multi-year expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland, adding two new themed lands \u2014 Arendelle: The World of Frozen and Stark Expo Hong Kong \u2014 to the park.\\n\\nArendelle: The World of Frozen, themed to the popular Disney franchise Frozen. Opening in 2021.\\nStark Expo, inviting guests to combat villains with Marvel superheroes. Opening in 2023.Throughout the park are \\'Hidden Mickeys\\', or representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor.\\nAn elevated berm supports the 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad (built by Severn Lamb) that circumnavigates the park.\\n\\n\\n=== Lands of Hong Kong Disneyland ===\\n\\nThe park currently has seven themed areas hosting various rides, shops, restaurants, and live entertainment.\\n\\n\\n==== Main Street, U.S.A. ====\\n\\nInspired by the Main Street, U.S.A. in Disneyland, the buildings of this Main Street are almost identical to those in Anaheim. Like other Disney theme parks, Hong Kong Disneyland\\'s Main Street, U.S.A. serves as the entrance of the park. Plans originally featured a restaurant under the Railroad station, but were scrapped due to budget reasons. The decor is small-town America from the years 1890\u20131910.\\nThough being very similar to Anaheim\\'s main street, the theme is heavily influenced by European immigrants. Plaza Inn \u2014 which has the identical exterior design as the one in Disneyland \u2014 mimics a classical Chinese eatery that was created by a wealthy American couple who were infatuated with Chinese culture. Another restaurant, the Market House Bakery is reminiscent of a bakery founded by a Viennese pastry chef who brought the world\\'s most famous desserts from the Austrian imperial court.\\nUnlike Main Streets from other parks, Main Street at Hong Kong Disneyland is built mainly of wood instead of stone. There are no horse-drawn streetcars, though tracks for another of the Main Street Vehicle can be seen in concept art.\\n\\n\\n==== Adventureland ====\\n\\nHong Kong Disneyland\\'s Adventureland is the biggest among all Disney parks. It features a large island area home to Tarzan\\'s Treehouse, which is circled by the Jungle Cruise (Jungle River Cruise) \u2014 much like the Rivers of America in most Frontierland theme areas. The Adventureland is also home to the \"Festival of the Lion King\" show. The new atmosphere stage show \"Moana: a Homecoming Celebration\" debuted on 25 May 2018 at Jungle Junction. A new outdoor venue. it is the first part of the multi-year expansion being unveiled to the public.\\n\\n\\n==== Fantasyland ====\\n\\nFantasyland features Sleeping Beauty Castle as its icon. It also has several attractions based on Disney films such as The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, it\\'s a small world and Cinderella\\'s Carousel. There is also Fantasy Gardens where costumed Disney characters can be met, and a Fairy Tale Forest.\\n\\n\\n==== Tomorrowland ====\\n\\nTomorrowland at Hong Kong Disneyland features an emphasis on metallic trim, dominated by blue and purple hues. Since the opening of the park, unique attractions have been added into the Hong Kong\\'s Tomorrowland, such as a new Autopia and Stitch Encounter. The first ever Marvel attraction in a Disney theme park, The Iron Man Experience, opened on 11 January 2017 in an area previously envisioned for a Star Tours-type attraction. The land also featured Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters on opening day, but that was replaced with Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, which opened on 31 March 2019.\\n\\n\\n==== Toy Story Land ====\\n\\nOpened 18 November 2011, Toy Story Land is the first new themed land since the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland in 2005. It is located to the west side of the park, behind Fantasyland. Toy Story Land is themed using bamboo to act as giant blades of grass surrounding the area. The themed land makes use of characters from the Toy Story movies, such as an enlarged Woody, Rex, an oversized paper plane, and Luxo Jr.\\nToy Story Land was marketed by the park as \"Asia exclusive\". For some time its only counterpart, Toy Story Playland, is located at Walt Disney Studios Park in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, France. Since Toy Story Land became popular at this park, it will become more common. One at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Orlando opened in June 2018, and one in Shanghai Disneyland opened even earlier.\\n\\n\\n==== Grizzly Gulch ====\\n\\nOpened on 14 July 2012, this land is the Hong Kong equivalent of Frontierland and Critter Country. The themed land reminisces an abandoned mining town called \"Grizzly Gulch\", set amidst mountains and woods. The centrepiece structure is Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, inspired by Grizzly Peak in Disney California Adventure Park. The town was set to be founded 8 August 1888 \u2014 the luckiest day of the luckiest month of the luckiest year \u2014 by prospectors looking to discover gold.\\n\\n\\n==== Mystic Point ====\\n\\nOpened on 17 May 2013, Mystic Point is a new themed land in Hong Kong Disneyland. It is also the final area opened in Hong Kong Disneyland\\'s current expansion. It is set in 1909 at an adventurer\\'s outpost established in 1896 in a dense, uncharted rain forest surrounded by mysterious forces and supernatural events. The site features Mystic Manor, home of Lord Henry Mystic, a world traveler and adventurer and his mischievous monkey, Albert.\\n\\n\\n==== Future: Arendelle: World of Frozen ====\\n\\nA land behind Fantasyland will host two rides themed to the movie Frozen. Opening in 2021, Frozen Land is set in the fictional Kingdom of Arendelle. The land will feature two rides, a sleigh style family rollercoaster,  and a Frozen dark ride similar to Frozen Ever After at EPCOT.\\n\\n\\n==== Future: Stark Expo ====\\n\\nOn 22 November 2016, it was announced that Tomorrowland would be partly transformed into a Marvel-themed area, as part of a massive six year expansion plan. This expansion would see the replacement of Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters by an attraction featuring Ant-Man and The Wasp, named \"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!\" for 2019 and the construction, on the former Autopia site, of a major E ticket attraction, \"Avengers Quinjet\", based on the Avengers franchise to be completed by 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Entertainment and celebrations ==\\nThe park features a daytime parade \"Flights of Fantasy\", as well as a nighttime parade \"Paint the Night\", and a former nighttime firework show \"Disney in the Stars\". Seasonal entertainment, such as \"Disney\\'s Haunted Halloween\", \"A Sparkling Christmas\", and \"Disney\\'s Chinese New Year\", are held in the park to celebrate major holidays.\\n\\n\\n=== Entertainment ===\\n\\n\\n==== Flights of Fantasy Parade ====\\n\\nThe parade premiered on 18 January 2011 as part of \"Celebration in the Air\", celebrating the 5th anniversary of the Hong Kong Disneyland. The parade replaced Disney on Parade, which had been running since the park\\'s opening. It is produced by Steve Davison, the producer of World of Color in Disney California Adventure Park.\\n\\n\\n==== Disney Paint the Night ====\\nDisney Paint the Night parade debuted in September 2014. It is a successor of the Main Street Electrical Parade and the first fully LED parade Disney has ever created. It features seven original floats containing over 740,000 individual lights. According to David Lightbody, Director of Entertainment and Costuming of the resort, the creative team spent over 2 years and developed over 1,000 scenic and lighting designs to ensure the parade.\\n\\n\\n==== \"We Love Mickey\" Projection Show ====\\nSince March 2018 and in replacement of the \"Disney in the Stars\" firework spectacular which ended because of the castle transformation, this nightly show of approximately 15 minutes is described as a surprise celebration that will transform the buildings along Main Street, U.S.A. into a canvas of vibrant, colorful visuals that pay tribute to Mickey Mouse\\'s major milestones, the birthday edition of the show softly opened on 18 November and fully opened on 19 November. The original edition of the Show returned on 25 February.\\n\\n\\n==== Future: New Daytime & Nighttime Spectacular ====\\nOn 22 November 2016, Hong Kong Disneyland announced a massive multiyear expansion plan which includes a completely redesigned Castle and hub area. After the reconstruction, the hub will house a new daytime stage show, featuring various Disney friends and princesses. The show is scheduled to debut in September 12, 2020.\\n\\n\\n=== Park celebrations ===\\n\\nHong Kong Disneyland has organised entertainment and a number of shows as part of the festive celebrations to attract more visitors, especially young adults.\\nOne of the events is the world\\'s exclusive Disney\\'s Haunted Halloween, which is the only Magic Kingdom-themed park in the world to celebrate the Halloween season with frightening walk-through attractions. Even though the attractions are full of living haunts and spectres that appear around corners, Disney tradition is preserved and gory scenes are excluded. It was later replaced by Disney Halloween Time event for serious challenge.\\n\\n\\n== Hong Kong Disneyland: The Grand Opening Celebration Album ==\\nHong Kong Disneyland: The Grand Opening Celebration Album was the soundtrack for the grand opening ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Much of the album are Cantonese or Mandarin cover of theme songs of animated Disney films. The package contains a DVD featuring music videos. The album does not contain any music used in the park.\\n\\n\\n=== Track listing ===\\nReleased: 2 September 2005\\nLabel: Sony Music Entertainment (Hong Kong)\\nLanguage: Cantonese and Mandarin\\nStatus: Out of printJacky Cheung \u2013 \"Let the Wonder Soar\" (\u8b93\u5947\u5999\u98db\u7fd4) (Cantonese)\\nTwins \u2013 \"it\\'s a small world\"\\nEason Chan \u2013 \"A Whole New World\" (from Aladdin)\\nKaren Mok \u2013 \"When You Wish upon a Star\" (from Pinocchio)\\nTwins \u2013 \"Mickey Mouse Theme\"\\nJolin Tsai \u2013 \"Under the Sea\" (from The Little Mermaid)\\nKelly Chen & Kellyjackie \u2013 \"On a Date With Him to Disneyland\" (\u4ed6\u7d04\u6211\u53bb\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c)\\nNicholas Tse \u2013 \"Bare Necessities\" (from The Jungle Book)\\nCoCo Lee \u2013 \"Colors of the Wind\" (from Pocahontas)\\nJoey Yung \u2013 \"Undying True Love\" (from Beauty and the Beast)\\nKelly Chen \u2013 \"Reflection\" (from Mulan)\\nHarlem Yu \u2013 \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" (from The Lion King)\\nJacky Cheung \u2013 \"Let the Wonder Soar\" (\u8b93\u5947\u5999\u98db\u7fd4) (Mandarin)DVD\\n\\nSubtitles: Traditional Chinese\\nRegion Code: All region\"Let the Wonder Soar\" (\u8b93\u5947\u5999\u98db\u7fd4) music video \u2013 Jacky Cheung\\n\"On a Date With Him to Disneyland\" (\u4ed6\u7d04\u6211\u53bb\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c) music video \u2013 Kelly Chen & Kellyjackie\\nCars trailer\\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe trailer\\nChicken Little trailer\\nSky High trailer\\n\\n\\n== Public transport ==\\n\\n\\n=== MTR ===\\n\\nThe park is accessible on the MTR via the purpose-built Disneyland Resort Line, a themed shuttle train service between the Disneyland Resort station adjacent to the park, and Sunny Bay station, where passengers can transfer to the Tung Chung Line for access to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, or Tung Chung. The line runs modified Metro Cammell M-Trains on the 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) non-stop route. The trains have been converted to run fully automatically without drivers.\\n\\n\\n=== Bus ===\\n\\nLong Win Bus operates 3 regular routes to the Disneyland Resort Public Transport Interchange in front of the park.\\nRoute R8 is a circular route running between Disneyland and the Lantau Link Toll Plaza Bus Interchange. The latter can be accessed by any of the routes with the A or E prefixes (e.g. A11 or E32), and is always the first stop after crossing the Tsing Ma Bridge. It is the only all-day route serving the park, and is jointly operated with vehicles from Citybus.\\nTwo additional regular routes, running on weekends and public holidays only, provide direct service between other places in the New Territories and Disneyland. They are route R33 to Tuen Mun station and route R42 to Tai Wai station via Tsuen Wan and Sha Tin. For both routes, one trip departs towards Disneyland in the mornings and the return trip departs approximately 20 minutes after the evening fireworks display.\\nIn addition to the above regular trips, seven special routes (including one cross-harbour route) operate to and from Disneyland before and after special events at the park, of which two are operated by Citybus and the other five by Long Win Bus.\\nCertain midday and late evening trips of Citybus route B5 between the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Sunny Bay station are routed via Disneyland.\\n\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\n\\n\\n=== Overcrowding problems ===\\nJust before the grand opening, the park was criticised for underestimating the daily capacity.  The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on 4 September 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park. The event turned out to be a disappointment, as there were too many guests. Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes, and wait times at rides went up to 2 hours.\\nAlthough the park\\'s shareholders and the Hong Kong Government set pressure upon the park to lower the capacity, the park insisted on keeping the limit, only agreeing to relieve the capacity problem by extending the opening time by one hour and introducing more discounts during weekdays. However, the park stated that local visitors tend to stay in the park for more than nine hours per visit, implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem.During the Chinese New Year 2006, many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets, but were refused entry, because the park was already at full capacity. Some disgruntled visitors, mainly tourists, attempted to force their way into the park by climbing over the barrier gates. Disneyland management was forced to revise their ticketing policy and designated future periods close to Chinese public holidays as \\'special days\\' during which admission would only be allowed through a date-specific ticket. Ticket prices during the week were changed to reflect cheaper prices. Meanwhile, weekend prices were raised. The prices were changed in an attempt to crowd-control so the crowds would be more even throughout the week and therefore the lines would not be as bad on weekends.\\n\\n\\n== Public relations ==\\nDisney initially refused to release the attendance figures after media reports surfaced saying the park\\'s attendance numbers might be lower than expected. Disney finally declared on 24 November 2005, that Disney had over 1 million guests during its first two months of operation.\\nIn response to negative publicity locally and to boost visitor numbers, Hong Kong Disneyland offered $50 discounts for admission tickets to holders of Hong Kong I.D. cards in the period before 2005 Christmas. Also, from March to June 2006, the park offered Hong Kong I.D. card holders the opportunity to purchase a two-day admission ticket for the price of a single day ticket.\\n\\n\\n== Park ambassador ==\\nHigh glory ambassador2015 to present is Kay Tse\\n2005 to 2015 Jacky Cheung\\n\\n\\n== Attendance ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nShanghai Disneyland Park\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website",

          "My last visit to HK Disneyland was 5 years ago with my first born. This time round we came again with 2 children. Transportation to the theme park is easy with the MTR, which stops just right outside the theme park. The photo session begins from the trains as these are",
          "If you are in south-east Asia and you want to visit Disneyland then HK is your best bet to go. I am from India and the biggest reason we visited HK is Disneyland. I had been to LA Disneyland which is pretty big but i want to take my son to Disneyland from India and since we dont",
          "Even though I came with my little daughter there, I also enjoyed it very much. Everything is picturesque ... invested to a very high standard. As you walk around Fairyland. We spent all day and night there.",
          "I would not recommend a visit to Disney at the moment a lot of new work going on and many attractions are closed or covered over, once the work is completed I would recommend then do not know when work will be completed.",
          "This was my families first experience at an international Disney property and it couldn\u2019t have gone better. We went for 2 days and stayed at the Explorers Lodge. 2 days might be a little overkill at this park for the time we went. We visited during the week in November, which",
          "I enjoyed the parade especially the last part wherein everyone is seated waiting for the fireworks display.",
          "Me and my family had a great time in HKDL. It was our first time to visit the place and my daughter had an amazing experience from the rides, parade, and show. Will definitely come back! Truly the Happiest Place on Earth...",
          "Visited Hong Kong Disney on Halloween and it didn't disappoint. Loved the MTR trains with Mickey Mouse shaped windows, hand rails and the statues on board. The park was wonderfully decked out in Halloween decorations and we thoroughly enjoyed collecting Halloween 'baddie'",
          "This may come as a surprise to some of you, but the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong has deterred up to 80% of the normal crowd in Hong Kong Disneyland. The place is quiet, and the smaller crowd has led to a number of restaurants being shut. There are only a few dining options when",
          "Bought the adult ticket online via Klook - much cheaper than buying ticket at the entrance. Spent 9hrs there, good time of year because hardly any queues. Castle was undergoing renovation & many cafes/food places were also closed. Ironman ride was great, along with it\u2019s a small",
          "Due to the recent \"unrest\" in Hong Kong, visitors to Hong Kong Disney have been drastically reduced. I took my grandson to the park last week. We enjoyed every minute of it. There was no lining up at most of the attractions. We repeated Ant Man, Iron Man and Winnie the Pooh",
          "Such an amazing afternoon spent at Disney! Didn't stay for the night fireworks due to the heat of the day! Only complaint, not enough food/drink vendors!",
          "Great day at Disneyland with friends visiting from Australia. The rides were perfect for the boys (8 & 9 years old) and our 2 year old daughter loved all the Princesses.",
          "It was a fun and imaginative place. Definitely captures the essence of what Disney is about. A little let down due to the fact that it is way smaller than Disney in the US. But it was magical like always.",
          "It is a typical Disney being very clean and nice for the children. All of the rides worked and it was a great 2 days.",
          "Its the 2nd disney amusement park we visited. Lines are short because probably its a week day. Asian food serves sumptuous meal that\u2019s worth your buck. The light parade is a spectacular way to end the day of magic.",
          "Ok, so this is the smallest DisneyLand on earth in term of size, BUT it has its own merits. First, the lines and wait times were only 15 minutes max for attractions. Second, a smaller park means you don't need to walk a long way or rush from show to show. Third and most",
          "Visited during Halloween period. The queues were minimal - 5 to 10 minutes maximum wait time with the exception of character pic taking. they are taking time with character poses, each can have a minute to 3, hence it will take longer than rides We enjoyed low crowds and",
          "We visited Hong Kong Disneyland for 2 days over Halloween. We arrived on Halloween itself using the MTR so the portions of the journey from Sunny Bay to Disneyland was using their train, which was a great start to the journey. We had a two day ticket which great value as cost",
          "This is the smallest of all the Disney lands and probably the only one you can complete within a day. Most of the rides are for kids. For adults you might only want to see tommorow land, adventure land and gristly glutch ride..",
          "Visited during halloween period. They seem to have shortened park hours since my last visit Weekdays are now 1030 to 730pm. Not much queues for the rides but very long queues for the character meet and greets. Maybe they should add more character meet and greets since there",
          "Visited the park on a Saturday, castle is still under renovation for almost a year. Half the eateries are closed. Food cart choices are limited and not tasty. Rides and shows are ok with short queues due to the protest situation in the country. The worst part are the staffs\u2019",
          "No long lines during our visit. Strong wifi, drinking fountain, shops everywhere! Very festive mood during the parade. Too bad we didn\u2019t catch the fireworks, if there were any.",
          "It was our first time to go to Disneyland on a Halloween and it was a nice experience. We love the candies! So yummy! I wish they could provide more.",
          "I purchased an entry ticket for hong kong disneyland through the klook app, I made a mistake and purchased the child ticket instead of the adult, I have sent numerous emails and messages to the customer service of the klook app and was advised my booking could not be amended, I",
          "A must day trip when visiting Hong Kong. We managed to see and do everything in one day and queues were mainly short. Download the App for waiting times to maximise your day. Easily accessible on the MTR.",
          "Everything was stunning and exceptionally well designed in every conceivable detail. We enjoyed low crowds and spent 1,5 day and tried everything. The Star Wars indoor rollercoaster was the favourite followed by the Mine Coaster and Iron Man 4D. The Tarzan island was great and",
          "So so excited to share this review. We had a fabulous day at Disneyland Hong Kong today! The weather was beautiful and clear. The train ride was a breeze. There were almost NO queues and we had a blast!! It was super organised but not crazy busy. The shops are set out",
          "Had the best visit to HK Disney! The rides here are similar to the parks in the U.S. but with some cool twists and unique changes. And of course the landscaping is gorgeous and the staff is stellar!",
          "This is my third time visiting Disneyland, there was a big mess in the lineup. I complain to the staff for the first time, there are too many people jump in the line, especially the mainland China people. but when I came back for the second time and the third time, they have not",
          "I have been to all disney except the one is shanghai so I believe I am at a good position to comment on Hk Disneyland. Disneyland in Hk is way too small comparing with those in the US and France. Number of entertainment facilities are not enough as well. Just one theme park is",
          "Visited here on an afternoon after going to see the big Buddha. It was on the train line on the way back to Hong Kong so hopped off. Had a fab time, park wasn't crowded, max wait for rides 15 minutes. There was nothing I didn't like about the park. First time to Disney and felt",
          "Park is smaller than Paris or Singapore and attractions are much simpler. No big rides at all. Not much to do there",
          "Your management sucks. Of all the theme parks I went. I have never seen one that requires people to stand. Most will ask guests to sit. Especially you have so much guests are children, young children. Many adults were unable to watch the shows, what more children. I had come to",
          "We went to Disney HK yesterday and booked with Klook online a few days ago. We bought a ticket with food combo (food and a drink worth up to $133 after 4:30pm). We grabbed an Uber to get there but the MTR is easy and cheap too. Due to the riots, it was almost empty for Disney",
          "After my test, my friends and I decided to go away from the stressful classes and spend a nice day ni Disneyland. At first, I refused to go since I think it is only a place for childish people. However, after spending a day there, I found out that my previous thoughts were",
          "In Hong Kong for a few days and couldn\u2019t resist a visit to Disney and so pleased we did. It quite different from Paris, Los Angeles and Florida all of which we have previously visited. It not as big as the others but just as good, the Disney magic extends to Hong Kong,",
          "Well run theme park. Due to the protests, wait for most rides was 5 minutes. The whole park and toilets are very clean, beautiful gardens. Rides were fun. It\u2019s a small world was just beautiful. Loved it.",
          "We visited Hong Kong Disneyland at a quiet period. No line ups for rides and easy to walk around. We purchased a ride priority ticket but it turned out we didnt need to outlay extra money. The park was clean and staff pleasant. The centre of park where castle is is closed and",
          "Disneyland never disappoints.. Do come early so you can take pictures with the characters.. If you're lucky, you will be picked to be the visitor to open the Disneyland gates and take pictures with Mickey and Minnie.. Food is readily available everywhere.. When I went, the",
          "We obviously timed our visit well the longest we lined up was 10 minutes. A fabulous day for two full grown humans who just loved the nostalgia, rides and playfulness. One day was enough for us. And so easy to get there on the MTR.",
          "HK disney is the smallest I have visited - I have been to paris and LA. It was the size that appealed as its easy to do in one day. worth waiting for the fireworks or go to one of the hotels for dinner and see the fireworks. My daughter loves it and tries to visit every time",
          "Very friendly staff. This park is a little bit smaller than the others in the rest of the world but also make it more efficient to try a lot of games just in one day",
          "If you are into the Disney experience and in the area then you need to go to this even though its very pricey.",
          "Your first step in to the Lantau island and you will forget your life outside it till the time you are in Disneyland. It\u2019s a magical place with everything Disney about it! The souvenir shops, the restaurants and the Rides everything is AMAZING! I had visited the Paris Disneyland",
          "A lot of things were closed when we were there. It could have been the protest/economy problems, I'm not sure. Many snack carts and some eateries were closed. The castle had refurbishments going on, so there was a big crane and fencing around that. The park was also sunning",
          "My first visit to a Disney and it was outstandingly fantastic from the quality of service of the staff to the rides, all this and more enhanced our experience. A truly great experience and I would definitely revisit and recommend this place to others!",
          "Visited Disneyland and had a great time. Very quiet as it appears people are put off by the troubles currently happening. We manged to get on all the rides without waiting more than 10 minutes. We loved a few of the shows that managed to incorporate Mandarin, Cantonese and",
          "Brilliant experience for the kids. Disneyland hotel was grand and beautiful. Very expensive for dining and kids princess experiences though. We stayed in a kingdom club room which was good value as you get access to the lounge with food and drink throughout the day. All the",
          "We just spent two weeks there, we loved it even though they have renovations going on there was still plenty to see and do, this was our second trip here and its great, first week was hot and busy, second week a little cooler and less busy, the queues were only around 5 minutes,",
          "Good little park. can easily be done in 1 day no need for 2 days better for the little ones rather than teenagers.",
          "This is our 2nd Disney we\u2019ve been too. 1st was in Shanghai. We bought tickets there instead of online. There was like a queue of 3 people, so that was great. Then we had to line up at turnstiles. Looked like heaps of people but it didn\u2019t take long to get through. So we decided",
          "My wife and I paid a return trip to HK Disneyland and were not disappointed. We chose a Friday out of school holidays and apart from the parachute drop (30 minutes) the lomgest queue was 5 minutes. It is great for smaller children as there are only a few scarey rides, Be aware",
          "Hong Kong Disney is the smallest out of the parks I have been to, however, I still thoroughly enjoyed it! This park is well maintained, exceptionally clean and the people are polite. Most rides had a 5-10 minute wait. We liked how there were small variances in rides. We",
          "A nice day trip to Disney. Found the rides to be mainly child/ young person orientated. All the usual Disney theme. Good for a day trip. Rail network takes you straight there from HK centre.",
          "Love the magic there, all the shows are incredibly amazing. Going on a weekday seems to be a wise idea! Came during the festive season, special parades are arranged!",
          "We took the train to Disneyland and the kids thought it was the best thing to catch the Mickey train from Sunny Bay to Disneyland station. Once you reach the station, it's another 5-8 minutes walk (depending on the age of your kids) along avenues with statues, signs and water",
          "As a huge fan of Disney parks, Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. I\u2019ve been to this park 6 times and I would go again and again. Lots to do both on rainy days and sunny days, the park is the smallest of Disney parks but it still offers a wide range of attractions,",
          "I realised, on my first ever visit to Disney World, that Disney knows about queues. They snake the lines this way and that, have things for you to look at, sometimes screens playing video related to the attraction... As a result of it being a school day after a National",
          "Great experience for younger kids- targetted more for the 3-8 age group. Shows through the day, parades, rides, and a 'become a princess' set-up as well. Not a lot of good veggie-friendly food options.",
          "Disneyland always flairs with the magical feels. The rides were fun, safe and set up well. The 3D and 4D experiences were awesome! Naturally lines can be long. I feel some rides could close a little later. The fireworks in the end were stunning! Only downfall is how pricey",
          "I suppose I loved it so much because we were staying at the hotel, which meant that when my 4 year old broke after 3 hours, we could go back to the hotel for a rest, and return in the afternoon. It was Halloween themed and all the shows were full of the bad guys. BIG TIP: Ask",
          "This is not a top attraction in Hong Kong we found it in much need of updating and very unorganized without many adult rides But I am sure its great for children",
          "We loved our trip. Lots of rides extreme and kid friendly. Shows were high quality. Extremely clean.",
          "I absolutely adore this park. I am currently living in Shanghai and this park definitely shows its age in comparison (in the very best way)! There are so many different things that you can do and you're day will be filled with fun activities, meet and greets, rides, and very",
          "One day is more then enough here. It\u2019s a very small Disneyland. Short waiting time at the rides (few people during our visit). Not much for older kids.",
          "Of all the Disney parks, Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest, but it is expanding fast. Toy Story Land, Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch are recent additions. At present, the Castle is under wraps, to be unveiled as a much taller one in 2020. However, there are plenty of new",
          "My second visit to Hong Kong Disneyland and again it was an absolute treat. I love how there are attractions we all know and love from other parks, but that there are also attractions unique to this park. On both visits, there were virtually no lines at the park or very short",
          "Went in July 2019 and weather and humidity was atrocious. Queues were 1 to 1.5 hours long for the bigger rides. Fast pass was at least 3 hours in advance. Whilst great to see, it doesn\u2019t live up to the magic of Disneyland Anaheim or disneyworld. Atmosphere is just not the",
          "Easy to get to, pleasant surroundings & clean environment Went with adult children but more suited to small children. Need more restaurants and food choices, as many restaurants were closed. Reasonably priced & fortunately no queues, but not many rides to go on. Went in",
          "Really had a great time to enjoy & relax with the family. Even grow ups now, we still manage to be children once again upon seeing Mickey Mouse & Friends, Avengers, Star Wars & other Disney Characters. The parade was so colorful & watchable, so sad to see the Disney Castle is",
          "Absolutely love Disneyland. It was so much fun! They know how to make everything not only great. My family loved our experience. The weather was perfect. My son got to see all the super heroes. Food is pricey but it is what it is. The park was very clean & their selection of",
          "This place was amazing. It's like you are in some magical and wonderful world. Disneyland Hong Kong have a lot of exciting attraction. such as toy story land, tomorrow land, and fantasy land. Disneyland is also one of the world - famous theme park in the world. But Disneyland",
          "Awesome experience with my colleagues. The place is very clean, wide and beautiful. The sounds makes you feel in the place of magic and enchanted. All the characters are good looking and the food was also great. You will enjoy every single attractions here in Hongkong",
          "I am a Disney fan. I was looking forward to my return visit to Hong Kong Disneyland but, this time, I was disappointed. A big area of the park is under reconstruction and there were no fireworks. However, the Lion King performance was wonderful, the Moana presentation was",
          "We arrived at Disney land on a Tuesday morning. The admission cost was 1917.00 HKD for three adults.I did not feel that this was excessive at the time but as we walked through the park we found that three quarters of the food outlets were closed. The rides were underwhelming",
          "First discovery, if you are over 65 years old, entry price at ticket booth is 100 hkd instead of the regular rate. Wow! There is no line as visitors are much less, mist the many Chinese from mainland China. So good news is that you can enter each ride and show without much",
          "Great place to spend a day even without children and let your inner child have fun! As they were celebrating Halloween the park was decorated with pumpkins, ghouls, etc. Great atmosphere. Best to get there early as there were no long queues for the rides. Found all the staff",
          "We added this park to our Asian Adventure just coming back two days prior from Shanghai Disney. The rides were fantastic and of course the park was immaculate being Disney. It's a must do if you're in HK we didn't do any shows but we hit every ride two + times. Because of the",
          "We went to disneyland on a tuesday. Barely any lines at any rides, which was really nice. Main street was lovely decorated for halloween. We enjoyed the rollercoaster at Grizzly gulch the most, but there were several other rides appropriate for adults. The Stark experience og",
          "The site is under renovation and possibly needs to have a discounted price while this is happening. Some attractions are closed. Kids still had a great day out.",
          "not really worth 130 odd dollars each wasnt alot to do and see a very small park.completed park in 2 hours probably best suited to small children",

          "Not a lot to do at Disneyland and a disappointment. Only enjoyed one show, rides were few and food choice was sadly lacking, unless you were Asian.",
          "It's definitely one of the smaller Disneylands and it's under a bit of construction, but it does some things really well. The shows were all exceptional...we loved all of them - the Festival of the Lion King, Mickey & the Wonderous Book, 3D Mickey's Philharmagic and of course",
          "To reach Disneyland from any part of Hong Kong is as smooth as cake. Kids had a blast. Suggest to reach as early as possible. The later you reach, more lines you will get in each attractions.",

          "Just wanted to say how excellent Jason and candy were when we booked in and how helpful they were. The rooms were amazing",
          "Visited today and oh my goodness it was such a great day. I would reccomend this Disney as the best one to take little kiddies to, just because today there was no waitlines on any of the rides, there was plenty of water play areas and you could take your time. My favourite area",
          "Their rides was amazing and the best thing was the parade i saw every single cartoon my Litlle brother was. Very very happy",
          "We used this attraction and hotel as a stopover on our way to London. We had my 7 year old grandson and surprised him. Because of the issues in Hong Kong, or supposedly as we did not see any, The attraction was nearly deserted which was a shame in one way and not in another. We",
          "First time i saw it i feel so excited entering inside. Im so amazed to see the beauty of it. I enjoyed to eat the foods. At end of the day ..watching the oarade is so unpredictable.. Very beautiful.ad uniqye how it was made especially the cartoon characters. So different.",
          "With all the media scaring tourists away from HK, this meant for a relaxed and pleasant day at Disneyland. No queues for any rides so we went on multiple times just cos we could! Only downside was that the castle was closed for renovations.",
          "Very nice place to visit but for me not very recommended to enter the Disneyland when bring small baby or toddlers. Entrance fees a bit expensive but depend on your type of visit. For me take photo together at entrance is good enough.",
          "This is quite a small disneyland compared to other disneyland. However my kids like thia theme park. There is no long queue as we took fast pass to skip the queue just come back to the specific attraction at the specified time. Unlucky that during my last visit, the firework was",
          "We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and signed up to the Kingdom club which was a set floor of the hotel that supplied a buffet breakfast and 24/7 snacks. Fantastic staff and great for a late flight arrival. The park itself was VERY QUIET due to it being a week before Halloween",
          "There is no place in the world that is managed as good as Disneyland. They hold the ultimate standard in customer service. The attractions were spectacular. The park was super clean. The staff was polite and super friendly. This was a great day at the park. Although, everything",

          "Disneyland Hong Kong was the perfect introduction to a Disney park for my 3 kids. It\u2019s big enough to enjoy all the special rides and attractions that Disney is known for but small enough to not feel too overwhelmed. The park is spotless, lines are not too long, and the staff is",
          "We were travelling with kids and it was raining cats and dogs during our 2 days visit. Tho, it rained a lot, the best thing was there are no queues to the best of rides and shows that we finished experiencing them all in one day!",
          "I was so excited to visit this park. But it was a little disappointing, especially when compared to other Disneyland Parks in Japan and the USA. I think the park is in the middle of a transition/renovation, so quite a few attractions were closed. There were more gift shops",
          "It was different experience this time because way back in 2015, me and my husband went there on a winter season. This time, it\u2019s summer and we have a toddler with us. We decided not to bring my son\u2019s personal stroller as we saw that stroller rental is available there. Yes it",

          "This summer we took our 10 year old grandson to Hong Kong enroute to Australia. Despite the demonstrators we were able to continue our plans without problem. Disneyland is much smaller than the American one but that was expected. It had the flavour of the original and certainly",

          "Why Hongkong Disneyland don\u2019t just close totally the park when it\u2019s under construction, specially the Castle? Or maybe just reduce the entrance fee. It\u2019s really expensive and when you are inside its frustrating. No fireworks unlike other Disneyland that every night there is a",
          "We absolutely loved this park, yes it is a bit smaller than Anaheim, but it\u2019s the exact same look and feel without all the crowds, the Disney train to get there was super cool. There was barely any lines for rides and the themed areas were fantastic. It was a shame that the",

          "I really enjoyed our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's not a big park, but it has some very fun rides that you cannot find at the other Disney parks. Mystic Manor was definitely my favorite ride. Tomorrowland has some very fun Marvel themed rides. This is worth a visit!",
          "Its a great getaway from work stress and school at the same time. Kids had fun so did us adults. worth every buck, sweat and tiredness you put in to go around the whole land. lining up for rides and photos was a bit a pain but did manage to get through some without lining up. im",
          "Wonderful place for the Daybreak. As usual crowded. Don't miss Iron man, Ant man, Star wars, Lion King, Donald duck, Mystic point, Little Small world shows. Wild River cruise is good. Fantasy land shows r good. Don't miss the night parade on main street. Very Good Indian",
          "No words can explain how amazing and nostalgic this place is. It is more geared toward kids especially the rides and attractions. But as a young adult, this place was still amazing. Been here 3 times and the magic is still there.",
          "WE had a fun time at disney world Hongkong. We were there on a weekday so that we get less crowd and we can take more rides. This worked well. We completed most of the sections, had a train ride, attended parades and clicked snaps with most of the characters. The staff gives",
          "very lucky - overcast day, very small crowds and maximum wait on most rides 5-10 minutes. plenty of places to get refreshments, mostly Asian food, plenty of water stall as it was humid. we had a great time - maybe should habe taken some grandchildren with us!!!",
          "The park is the perfect size for a day visit - we were there from 10 to 9 and went on 17 ride, saw 2 shows and did 3 meet and greets. We didn't have to queue for more than 25 minutes for any ride and the average wait was less than 15 minutes at the end of July. The park is",

While this was the surprise for my kids , once you enter , the castle is Under Construction, what takes a little the magic away. The park is also under construction( bigger) It\u2019s quit expensive",

          "As in other Disneyland Parks, they have brand to maintain, so I don't think you'll be disappointed being here (as some negative comments said). One thing that bothered us is that a few uneducated visitors will try to cut the lines. But in all attractions we got, we only see one",

          "For a lot of people, Disneyland is this magical place you always dreamed of going as a child. I've been there twice and my latest visit there was March this year and we took our 12 year old Granddaughter with us. The price you pay for your admission ticket, covers all the",

          "As lovely as the place was, there is lots of wiring as there are far too many adults wiring up to go on the rides which are meant for children. I understand that Disneyland is for all ages, but I do feel children should come first. We waited for quite sometime with my young",

          "In my recent trip to Disney Hong Kong was about the worst place I have ever been. I was traveling with my wife and daughter. It was our first time to Disney in Hong Kong . What made this trip so bad was the people from China. I will explain. I have heard about how rude people",
          "I have booked 2 rooms for 2 nights which cost be $500plus per room per night. In light of the recent protest in Hong Kong and I am bringing young kids, I requested for hotel cancellation. if unable to cancel, I told the staff to provide me with 1 year of validity for me to visit",

          "once you've been to the US Disney, nothing compares. The weather was very hot and humid so make sure to bring sunscreen, a fan, an umbrella and plenty of water. I loved that they splashed water during the parade to help cool us off. The castle was under renovation so there was",

          "It was the Easter holidays when I went there. It was surprisingly not crowded. The new Ant Man and Wasp ride has just opened and it was awesome. It was once a Buzz Lightyear ride. The acting by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly was realistic yet funny.",
          "The castle is being updated so it doesn\u2019t have the same awe arriving and walking up Main Street. They said it will be finished by next year not sure when. They have a new ride Ant Man and The Wasp which is a cool shooting game. The Iron Man right beside it all at Tomorrowland.",
          "We were there for two days. I know many people said one could\u2019ve finished in one day. But since it was July, super hot, and we had young children, we decided to take it slow and take breaks in the middle of the day at our hotel, and opted for the 2-day tkts. We had a great",
          "We went towards the end of July on a weekday. We got there for open at 10am and stayed until close after the parade at 9pm. The MTR is a super easy way to get to and from Disneyland and the specific disney line was all themed. Wait times for rides were pretty good, the longest",

          "Hong Kong Disney is great, it is Disney after all! When we went a typhoon came through so most of the place was closed on the first day. That was disappointing but unavoidable. The second day we arrived early and the weather cleared up so everything was open. My tips are to get",
          "Fun filled day with the family. Much smaller then California but we went with out 2 year old and I can safely say it was perfect for her age. So many things to do, the wait time was amazing on every ride max we waited was prob 8 mins. We went during school holidays to and it",
          "Not quite Disney World, however we had an Amazing day There are lots of great rides to make the day go buy, no need to go for more than one day as you can do it all in one, ride lengths are not too bad either for Disney. Food prices and drinks prices in the park however are",
          "Such a fantastic magical place to bring the family. Kids love it and adults love it because the kids love it. If you are staying in Hong Kong for quite sometime, meaning even just 2 weeks or more... get the annual pass, very worth it. So many rides and cute things to see and",

          "We had a layover in Hong Kong and decided to visit Disneyland. Park is smaller than the ones in US, but very similar rides and activities. It was super hot and humid so had to duck into shops to cool off. I was glad that we went, we had a lot of fun.",
          "Having just been to the Disney at Anaheim this year, and Orlando last year, the Hong Kong park has a lot to catch up on. In particular, some of the cast members are so miserable and really spoil the experience. I understand that you may be having a bad day, but as with any",

          "Husband and I visited in June, glad we purchased the fast pass as it was a very hot busy day. I do recommend bringing a hand held fan for when you are waiting in line. We enjoyed ourselves however it\u2019s more of an adventure park for family\u2019s with children :)",
          "Disneyland is definitely the best place for kids travelling to Hong Kong. Queue is quite long even though on weekday, especially the photo shooting session. Restaurant is crowded as well. Suggest to reach there once it's opened so that you have enough time to cover everything.",
          "It is interesting what universal appeal Disneyland has around the world! It beats any form of professional diplomacy in building cultural bridges!",

          "It was my ultimate childhood dream to visit Disneyland and the experience was unfortunately gloomy. The epic meet and greet with Disney's Royals, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, became an unfair situation upon our 3rd attempt to join the line. Unfortunately we were a few minutes late",
          "I had the best time here with my family. The queues are better here than the HK Ocean Park because most areas are covered unlike in HK Ocean Park the rides are cool and really child friendly. The food though were expensive but I will still definitely come back.",
          "To start off there was no waiting for rides! It was a big thing for us with a 3.5year old. I have been to Disneyland LA and it is nowhere as big but just as exciting for the little ones and my husband who hasn\u2019t been before. There was only 2 rides my daughter couldn\u2019t go on in",

          "The park is small enough that if you arrive when it opens you can probably do all the rides by the end of the day. The queues aren't too bad other than for a couple of things. All the rides have something different to what you'd normally get and are done exceptionally well,",
          "HK disneyland is well maintained including its comfort rooms and restaurants. But one thing for sure all is expensive including water. The souvenir shops are a craze and they add new items all the time. The rides were great and enjoyed their splash parade.",
          "It is a good place for a family however when going to Disneyland please be ready with the unpredictable weather. Bring umbrella and stroller if you have little ones like us coz renting a pram will cost you $240. Each bottle of mineral water there will cost you $28-$33 per drink",
          "Yes, it's the smallest of the Disney parks worldwide but whilst that may not appeal to some, it did to us. As a family of four with two toddlers it was absolutely perfect for us to navigate with ease. We visited late June and had read it would be quiet. Nope. It was still pretty",

          "We went on a Sunday morning. Variety of ways to get out to Disneyland on Lantau island, we drove and parked which is convenient but the parking is expensive. Advise to get their as early as possible. Chinese restaurant is a good option for food and stock up at the Main Street",
          "We especially stayed till the end for the parade @8pm. Wonderful, not to be missed! Weekdays are the best since the park is less crowded. Queues for the rides were shorter. Rather disappointed as the castle is under construction so there were no fireworks display until further",
          "Kinda disappointed that the castle was under construction, but it was our first disney experience and i think it was the perfect one for us. It wasnt too overwhelming you can literally do the whole park in like 4 hours. Long lineups to see the characters but that wasnt a issue,",
          "Fairytale like world, however expensive and not worth of tickets charged for. Also items avaliable inside Disneyland are very expensive. We visited on Sunday and there is huge rush, therefore always better to visit on week day.",
          "Small, compact Disneyland. Easy to get around. Not a lot of shady areas when walking to each attraction. Enjoyed our time there, unfortunately the Water ride at the Western area was not operational. Suits families with children under 10 as there are not many attractions suited",
          "not worth every penny. you will spend 95% of your time queuing . very bad managed considering you pay that much for this. not recommended at all.",
          "A fantastic place to visit in Hong Kong. This is my second time there since 2014. They have improved in crowd control and queue timings is much better. New rides like Iron Man and Antman are very good. Unfortunately, the train and castle is being upgraded at the moment. No fire",
          "This is my 3rd time here. The first time as a couple was not bad, second time with a toddler was soso. But then I regret coming back for the third time cuz they have gotten so much worse. I don\u2019t even see the point of giving a bad review cause honestly I doubt the admin in",
          "Had a great time at Disney. Was to easy to get to. Hardly any queues. Staff were as usual helpful. Great time to be there. Will be back again at some point.",
          "This place has great views but is so commercialised that it has lost a lot of its appeal. Still worth a visit but it\u2019s lost its gloss.",
          "Overall, I find the HK people unfriendly. Small park, can finish in a day. Thanks to a morning thunderstorm so crowds disseminated so that queues were shorter. Food wasn't great. Rides not bad for little kids. Generally my kids enjoyed.",
          "It was my first time visiting a Disenyland theme park it was hot but thats what youd expect in Hong Kong in the sumner time. Besides that, it was a overall good fun experience. Prob because of the weather and it being the middle of the week the wait time wasnt long and I manage",
          "After visiting Ocean Park so many times, visited Disneyland HK instead. Boring.... too small and all you have are rides, there is more variety in Ocean Park. Far cry from Disney in the U.S. Good price for seniors above 65 though only HK$100. Food inside not bad.",
          "Since I had a lot of time in Hong Kong I decided to take the bus from Hong Kong Island to Lantau, bus A10 or bust A12 and in Lantau I took the train to Sunny bay where the Disney Park is Located, the train is really cute and the park itself is really nice, I love small world and",
          "Must go for anyone of any age who love Disney! Of course if you have no interest, dont bother going and wasting the high price entrance fees. I'm weak at heart so I dont take the rides. Went in to relive my childhood days, pretended I'm a child all over again. Love their parade.",
          "I am a huge Disney fan and as we had a plane delay, we made the most of it by visiting Hong Kong Disney. (Thank you Finnair). The park is about twenty minutes from the airport and take a blue taxi. Price was approx $135 hk each way ($30 aud approx). Park entrance was $639 hk.",
          "We live in Orlando and are annual pass holders to the Disney World parks, so we were eager to see Hong Kong Disneyland, and how it compares or differs from the other Disney parks. We're happy to report we loved our day at HK Disneyland, and would definitely recommend it for the",
          "We were able to get two day tickets through Disney's web site for less than $14 each. What a deal!!! we've been to Disney parks in Annaheim, Orlando, Paris, and Tokyo. While Tokyo's park is the best, we enjoyed our time at HK Disneyland. Especially worthwhile is the Majestic",
          "Having been to the Disney Parks in the US, we were curious how this one would compare. By the end of it, we thought it had some interesting new takes on familiar, tried and true Disney themes. Starting with the train from the MTR station, with it's Mickey Mouse window openings,",
          "Enjoyed our 2 day visit to HK Disney. Yes, this park is a lot smaller than its counterparts, but it is still a magical place to visit. We visited the park in February so it was not too crowded and we were able to do all we wanted to do except evening show in one day. Our",
          "It was our first time for our family to visit HK Disneyland, and I must say it was the most amazing experience. almost all the rides & shows were great. the parade featuring all the disney casts was incredible. Overall, all our experience was beyond our imagination.",
          "Smaller than the usual Disneyland but it was just right for us since we have a 5 y.o kid with us. The Disney Princess meet and greet was a plus for the little girl. The Lion King show was superb. Loved the electric parade, high tech effects and colorful lights and costumes!",
          "If you love thrill rides, then don't miss Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars & RC Racer!!! Other fun (not so intense) rides are Hyperspace Mountain, Iron Man Experience, ANATW Nano Battle & Mystic Manor. Definitely stay for the nighttime parade. FYI: The castle is",
          "Been here 6 times over the 10 years and this place is still very well kept and added more rides and performances as well. The castle is under repair and hence no fireworks but there is still a closing night street parade.",
          "HK Disneyland is well connected via HK MTR (transfer at Sunny Bay station and hop on the Disneyland line). Reached around 1130am and it was scorching hot. Relatively short queues (mostly 20mins or less) even though it was a Sunday on the day of our visit. The longest queue we",
          "Actually, I visited HK Disneyland while having a layover. Lines in the entrance are long but too fast to enter. The staff are very accommodating. HK Disneyland is recommended for all ages. The designs for each area and entertainment are very awesome.",
          "with our 6&7 year olds, we did not have to spend the whole day in Disneyland since there are rides that has age or height limits. i downloaded the Disneyland HK App. It was a huge help and time-saver. From that app, you can already plan your route in the park or know when to go",
          "This was our fourth Disney park, having been to Walt Disney World, Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris and our experience measured up to them so it simply comes down to ... if you like Disney, you'll like this park! We were there off-season on a weekday and the crowd definitely",

          "I won't say that Disneyland Hong Kong doesn't have crowds, but it's less crowded than the U.S. parks and WAY less congested than other parts of Hong Kong. On a Sunday in May, our longest line was 10 minutes. Hong Kong cousins of Space Mountain, Small World, Haunted Mansion, and",
          "HK Disneyland is very homely place. The staff are wonderful and the experience great. The park is smaller than most Disney parks but the upside is that this can be done in 1 day.",
          "Clean, adn very few line ups the day we went. But there were a few things closed. No place to sit and have a glass of wine or a beer. As two adults we were planning to spend the day, and have dinner there. Food places not great, and we had done everything by 2:30. Home by 3;30.",
          "We've been to Disneyland/World in California, Florida and Japan. Hong Kong didn't live up to the others (Japan is my favorite). It's got some good rides, and it's still Disneyland, but it doesn't quite have the same magic Disney feel that the others do. Still worth a visit.",
          "This was my 1st visit to the HK Disney but I have been to the Disneyworld in FL twice before. This is a scaled down version. Go early - when the park opens and you will find the rides empty. Around 1pm is when the rush starts to build up. Can be completed easily in a day. It is",
          "My sister wallet was stolen in DisneyLand, precisely at The Shop beside Disney Oprah, and i like when the staff fast respon about the problem. But unfortunately the wallet wasn't founded. And like other disneyland we must queued up if you want play the thingy. And for the vibes",
          "Travelled to Hong Kong from Manila to do Disney and sites of Hong Kong. First day if Disney heavens opened but that did not deter us or the characters at Disneyland. A truly magical experience with 3 generations in the family. We concentrated mainly on the children's magical",
          "Some tips: 1. Go early. Crowds start around 12pm 2. Explore Klook for deals on entrance tickets + meals 3. Went on a rainy day. Hardly any queues 4. There are water fountains scattered around Disney. Bring your own bottle to reduce plastic 5. No fireworks display as castle is",
          "We booked our tickets in advance and did not have a long wait. Beautiful place, we've tried the roller coasters, dumbo the flying elephant, visited the sleeping beauty castle,the grizzly mountain ride, garden of wonders, 4D animated movies, mickey and the wondrous book and so",
          "Great for any age, well organised, but missed seeing the Disney characters, expected to see them roaming around",
          "This was our 3rd trip to Disneyland Hong Kong. Bought a 2 days pass like our previous trip as we wanted to enjoy Disneyland to the fullest. Chose a wrong day to go as the weather was wet. The waiting time for rides were short. Some of the attractions were closed too due to",

          "Though it is hot and humid, but we have so much fun in Disney. There is some renovation of the park, the theatre Golden mickey being repacked by Mermaid theme. It is new and also interest. Worth to visit. Especially the parade. It is hot but dancer did a great job under strong",
          "My kids have always loved theme parks. So while visiting Hong Kong disneyland was part of the agenda. It was a rainy day when we set out. The crowds were comparitively less and we chose a weekday. The usual Disney rides were quite good. We didn't even have to get the fast pass.",
          "The disneyland is much smaller than Anaheim, we got there by 9am though it was raining in the first half of the day, most of the rides where functioning, it was absolute fun esp. in tomorrowland.",
          "the cast members here must hate their jobs, hate the guests, or both? Walt Disney's vision for Disneyland is happy alternate reality where you can go to cheer up and be around cheerful people. HK Disneyland is not that. You can go just to say you've been, or to collect pins",
          "We availed of Klook Lunch Coupons and selected Starliner Restaurants only to be informed that we needed to claim our coupons at the gate entrance. My daughter went there, lined up for the 2nd time only to be advised that our coupons were \"expired\", we went back to the customer",
          "My daughter and I have been to all the Disneyland\u2019s now except for the Tokyo one. It is familiar territory for us by now so it is always good so compare the differences. For started this has to be one of the smaller ones around and the castle is by far the smallest. I understand",
          "Disneyland hongkong lives upto its name from the moment you take the special Disney metro. Kids get so excited from the very moment as creates a different world feeling for them. It's not as big as other Disneylands but it's really tiring to cover it fully in one day so would",
          "We have been to Disneyland in California, Tokyo, and now Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong is the smallest park, it still has a lot to offer. Our favorite rides were the Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. Two days was plenty in the park to get a chance to ride everything and",
          "One of the best places that I've been to with my 9 year old daughter. Beautiful place, fantastic shows and rides and amazing food. I would recommend to buy a priority pass as this place is usually pretty crowded. Priority access allows you fast access to some of the best rides",
          "As always you can forget about everything and be happy at Disney Hong Kong. everyone is friendly....",
          "1 day pass is not enough so we had 2 days but we did not really ride all. We had so much fun and thinking of visiting another Disneyland location by next year. Better go on Friday (with less line) and Saturday (when all attractions are open). I just wished there was fireworks.",
          "This was my first visit to Disneyland and it was amazing. Though i read quite a lot about Disneyland HK that it is quite smaller than others but for us it was quite big and we went there twice. Got the package deal of two days visit from their own website which came in handy and",
          "While in Hong Kong continued our quest to visit Disney around the world. It\u2019s a small footprint. Four lands- Fantasy, Tomorrow, Toy Story, and Adventure. Weekday visit is key, less crowds. Rode almost everything. With little to no wait we were done in 4 hours and back",
          "Perfect for young kids! They have a lot of rides that can allow your little ones - 4 yrs old and below to ride. Our favorite - Its a small world after all.",

          "HK Disneyland is a small park and can be done in one day, two if you like to take your time like I do. Festival of the Lion King was a surprise favourite and I ended up watching it three times. Mystic Manor was the stand out for me, I totally fell in love with it and with Albert",

          "I have a fun trip to HK Disneyland although I didn't catch a glimpse of fireworks display (the castle part is under renovation) I have to say they compensate it with a lot of show coming from Mickey. Nice job team HK Disney!",

          "The management of the park just made a dog\u2019s breakfast of this recent new program: Fast Pass is slowly rolled out, Priority Special is in. No more freebies for Platinum members. Too bad. Instead, HKD299 buys you priority admission to eight attractions. What\u2019s wrong? Staff needs",
          "It\u2019s nothing special compared to US Disney. Expect to be underwhelmed. I\u2019m told the local government too cheap to invest and make the place properly. Don\u2019t waste your time here.",

          "So have friends who are not fan of crowds but are fans of Disney and rollercoasters....So HK Disneyland seemed like a good introduction to Disney parks. The park itself is easy to get to using Hong Kong's subway system, it has it's own line and is very easy to navigate;",

However, the castle was under construction while I was there and we had no idea because when we booked the tickets it didn\u2019t state anything about anything being under construction.

          "My child did not have fun at all. To stand in queue for 50 minutes or longer for a very short ride is just horrible. We did not experience the magic of Disney. It was just frustrating to wander around and to see all those extreme long waiting lines. Way too expensive to spend",
          "Super, awesome, excellent... more and more adjectives! A very good theme park. Though the park is not very wide / large as compared to few other Disney parks, its good if one is travelling with toddlers. Wait times are manageable and priority access pass also helps. Vegetarian",

I wouldn't buy the food pass either as its limited to what you can use it on. 4 stars because it doesn't have that Disney Magic feel, but it was super clean and the rides were fun.",

But as an adult solo traveller, the park is small and very tame when it comes to thrill rides.\n\nFor the cost to enter, you could have more fun elsewhere in Hong Kong.\n\nIf you're a die hard Disney fan, stop by, otherwise give it a miss.",

          "Truly magical experience. Waiting times were minimal. Everything was great - rides, staff, food, shows, parades. Beats going to other crowded theme parks at this time of the year. Its definitely the silver lining behind a dark cloud. Stayed at the resorts hotel too, the hospitality is also great",

          "This place is so bad. The only character I saw was Mickey and he only waved and didn't stop for children. Most of the stands weren't even open. Ride time is shorter than the wait. It's basically just a park. If you wanna go to a theme park in Hong Kong I highly recommend Ocean Park!",

          "Who doesn\u2019t like disneyland ? It\u2019s a great theme park and offers plenty of rides for the whole family. Best enjoyed when your child is at least 5 yes of age. Food can be a little on the pricey side but that\u2019s expected. Only let down for us was some of the staff members which seemed to be rude.",
          "One of the smaller Disney parks, able to get through it in a day easily or even half a day if you walk fast. Still worth going with short lines on a Monday!",
          "Some fun and unique to this park rides. Ridiculously expensive for the local economy. Their website wouldn't work to give us shown deal, and no one could override locally.",
          "It's a wonderful place to go especially for the kids, a lot of rides,movies & souvenirs ( its more expensive) to buy. And to see  a different kinds of cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, tinker bell, Woody & Jessie,etc.",
          "Not many people and queuing time is not long",
          "If you want to avoid big crowds, now is the best time to visit. The trade-off is that some of the attractions are closed for renovations, but the cast members are as bubbly and all smiles as ever.",

          "Hong Kong Disney is beautiful and magical but not as thrilling as Euro or US.  The rides seem a bit toned down and catering to the little kiddies.  Ocean Park seems to have more variety.  The bonus is that you are allowed to carry in your own food and drink. Very very few vegetarian options and almost no vegan option s.",

          "A dream land for all the people in the world. In the theme park, there are a lot of Disney characters for you to take photo with. Besides, there are a lot of fun and adventurous games are ready for you to challenge them. When you are in the theme park, you are surrounded by the nice and excitement disney songs.",
          "Wait times are always great. \nThe queue to see Christmas Stitch was probably longer than most rides.\nBut eateries around lunchtime, shows at showtimes, and the main street gift shop towards the end of the day seem really up to capacity on weekends; it was PACKED. So I suggest doing your souvenir shopping throughout the park.",
          "Must spend one day in here. Iam pretty everyone will like this magical place, even you are adult or kids. There are so many atraction and game you can do. Make to sure to stay until night to watching the fireworks show.",
          "Visited Disneyland for the second time. They had Christmas events and we really enjoyed the time here. There were lots of new rides as well.",
          "Disneyland Hong Kong is great for the young and young at heart. You will see all of your favourite Disney characters. To visit all the attraction it would take at least all day if not more, so it pays to plan what you really want to see. There are fireworks in the evening.",
          "Excellent for kids. Also grown ups will have fun. Even if not as big as other Disney parks, this only is true to the Disney magic, with a spark of Asian taste.",

          "There is many rides at Disneyland that are all different kinds and suitable for all different kinds of ages. The food there and restrooms are really easy to access, there were many people dressed as characters and princesses and they were \u2026",
          "Fun fulfilled, fun packed, smiles and giggles family fun time. It's 1 of our happy places - we all enjoy, and we all leave happy (& usually exhausted!)",
          "Best place to spend your overall day. The fireworks at the ending are just something else. That cannot be described in words. Must visit place when in hongkong",
          "Small park much we had tons of fun. Most important lines were short.",
          "Truly the happiest place in the world! It is fun to spend your day here and reminisce your childhood together with your family or friends. We were lucky to have the place when there were not a lot of tourists so there was minimal queueing \u2026",
          "Very small compared to other Disneylands and most theme parks. Fun, but most (if not all) rides are for small kids. Not a ton to do as an adult. Plus, currently, the castle and many other sections are in the process of being updated. Fun for a half day at most.",
          "Love this place so much.  This is the first disneyland that I visited,  the athmosphere is very magical. All disney characters is very cute.  The park is big,  designed well with attention to details.  All games and attraction is very fun. \u2026",
          "During our visit, the castle is under renovation but who cares? THIS IS DISNEYLAND and yes, I did enjoy our visit here. This will surely make you a kid again. I was able to meet only Cinderella among the Disney Princesses due to hour \u2026",
          "Very nice attraction.Kids will enjoy. Have some shows and train rides which kids and adults will enjoy.Enjoyed many rides.",
          "I would not recommend go there nowadays because lot of attraction are under reconstruction, train is not running at all, mine cart roller coaster also not working until mid November and price for entry is still same, so schedule your visit rather for later",
          "Excellent place, my kids and wife enjoyed a lot. Worth visiting once a life time",
          "It was a great day to visit the park- perfect weather and no lines. It was very fun! The only problem was that the park is smaller than we thought, so we finished all the fun rides in about 3 hours (we planned to spend the whole day)",
          "There's a lot of attractive place to take a picture with and the best place to bring your kids.You might think that only your kids will enjoy the place, you got it wrong. The place is very enjoyable for everyone even the adults.",
          "Nice, many animals there",
          "Off to see Hong Kong Disneyland!\n\nThis will be the second Disney property that I\u2019ve been to, the first being Disney World in Florida, USA.\n\nI\u2019m spending my final full day in Hong Kong and decided to add this attraction to my bucket list.\n\nThis sure beats the winter weather back in Toronto, Ontario Canada.",
          "Was not at all crowded when we visited early January 2020 which made for a wonderful experience. Otherwise Disneyland can be so tiring with ling wait times",
          "Very good place to visit \nThere are more rides for kids .\nBut some rides are very good like iron man experience and star wars highspeed rollercoaster and many more. \nMust visit!!",
          "Smaller than most Disney's, but still Disney! Always a fun time at the park with a magical experience to make you feel like a kid",
          "Excellent place for kids, oh yeah, kidults as well. It\u2019s relatively smaller than the other Disneyland theme parks, but it should be good enough for spending a day. Then you should explore the other wonders in Hong Kong.",
          "Great place for family and dates. Quite a spectacular place to be in.",
          "Dream come true for all HK travellers. Disney characters and other rides you enjoy inside.",
          "I have no words to express. My dream come true going to Disneyland. Absolutely loved it.",
          "Much smaller than other Disney lands. Otherwise, it\u2019s great and lots of fun. \n\nI hated the food at the park. Such limited and bad options. \ud83e\udd2f",
          "its comparatively small but is one of the most wonderful and magic places ever! their fireworks at night are so astonishing and lively! Would bring my kids here for sure next time!",
          "Very small. Clean and organise. Workers were friendly. Food expensive. No fireworks at night. Final parade was fantastic. Good for kids and young people.",
          "I always wanted to go but now there is lockdown",
          "Me and My Family let loose our wildest dreams and imaginations, experiencing all the wonders and fantasies of the place. We truly enjoyed our stay.",
          "Great place. Not as big as some of the other Disney parks in the world. Great for young kids.",
          "It is a one day enjoyment.\nThere is a lot to see.\nHad a great time being there...but haven't seen the whole even though we returned at night from there.\nThere are shows and many more that are really awesome.\nThere are restaurants and small shops also.",
          "Very well managed. Very clean. Crowd management done very well. Staff are professional and friendly. All facilities are well maintained and well kept.",
          "Having been to Florida and Paris this is a very similar layout it was really quiet when we visited and we managed to get on all the rides with nothing more than a 20 min wait. A good days worth of fun with lots to see and do, but I'd say it's smaller than the other Disney parks. Loved the recent marvel updates to some of the rides!",
          "It is a smaller Disneyland but the ticket price relects that. It is still all magical with tons of shows and rides. It is busy with tons of people! Highest tier Season pass holders get to jump the lines (need to book in advance)  and closer parking.",
          "Clean and Beautiful settings\nMostly Enjoyable for child aged between 5~13\n(Of course with some exceptions)\n\nPrice of food is absurd even for an amusement park, which might be the reason preventing you from bringing in any food under the \u2026",
          "Smaller than Disneyland in the US  but still an amazing happy place.",
          "Loved the place,.my daughter enjoyed all the shows...",
          "Quite nice looking. It is obviously targeting kids younger than 10 years. For older kids only the part \"Tomorrowland\" is attractive which is too small to make the entrance price acceptable.",
          "Very small, but high quality. Very happy family fun, wonderful staff, polite guests & wonderful memories to grow old too. Magical.",
          "The experience is amazing! It makes you feel young again, will definitely come back again.",
          "It's so good, it has better machineries on their tech stuffs, there are a lot of places that you can go to.",
          "The best place to exhaust kid's stamina! You definitely need two full days to fully explore the whole theme park.",
          "very nice place, you can feel being a child if you are in this place!",
          "Despite going during the summer heat, the whole family had very good experience. There's something for everyone. Using the phone app was very helpful in terms of avoid long lineups.",
          "Disneyland Hong Kong is a very big theme park with rides, shows, music, parade, fireworks, animated people, etc, etc. Always crowed with people enjoying wearing Micky headband. The adventure land shows are exquisite. Almost all shows are \u2026",
          "I had a great time in Hong Kong Disneyland. The queues were short, everyone was happy. The parades were amazing.",
          "No lines when we went which was great. Small park can be easily done in a day. Worth the visit",
          "Great place! Fantastic world! Where dreams come true!",
          "Not great for adults. Most rides are kids friendly. Couple of good rides for thrill seekers. Good thing is wait times were minimum and we could cover the entire park. But castle closed. No parades. Not many characters spotted. Overall experience could be better.",
          "Love the place and adoring and lovable Disney's characters.",
          "Went here with a friend to celebrate her birthday.\nThe main street bakery was my favourite shop as there were lots of cute birds in there.",
          "It was one of the happiest place on earth, indeed.",
          "If you are staying in HK for more than 3 nights and you are a Disney fan (like me), you should go. It is small, but beautiful and shows are awesome. Just keep in mind that in low season many restaurants are closed, but the longer line will be 5 min or less :)!!!",
          "It's a nice place for both adult and children..",
          "Indeed happiest place on earth!!! Never been so alive in themed parks. Disney Princess everywhere, photo ops, incredible rides, lots of things to do. Download the Hongkong Disneyland app, it will guide you with your tour in Disney.",
          "A lovely theme park that you should spent at least one day",
          "Castle was sadly under construction \ud83d\ude41 but still had a great time! Went during Halloween and they gave out marshmallows and gummies for Trick or Treat! \n\nLines for character meet and greet took soooo long though. Waited for over 2 hours to get a photo with Mickey and Minnie at the entrance pavilion.",
          "Not bad, really. The best of all to me is the Star Wars Hyperspace Roller Coaster or something like that. Awesome. Then there is the Iron Man Experience. Really high tech. Tomorrowland, Adventureland are the best, I guess. Superb.",
          "Excellent ambience and decor. Smaller than other Disney worlds around the world. Some of the attractions are really good. Don't miss the iron man experience and spacex roller xoaster",
          "A bit crowded at times but the rides are high quality and the shows are all well made. I'd prefer if they set up more fast pass ques, or sold them, as the ques on anything but a normal weekday can be daunting.",
          "Fun and charming park still finding its way. Very little crowds at the time of visit. Could use a few more attractions.",
          "We had good fun! Hyperspace mountain, grizzly gulch and RC car rides are must try ones.",
          "Good place to visit. Small park which can be done in 1 day if it is less crowded.\nMostl of the rides are very simple and targeted for small children.\nTomorrow land rides are too good",
          "Fairly getting by, it isn't as good as few years before. I wish it become better after renovation project.",
          "Most Magical place;the Lion King Show(might I add very talented and handsome performers\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude18) and night parade are my fav and must see. Christmas time coming up and the christmas theme made it extra magical loved the fake snow effect...",
          "Love it so much! I feel like a kid again. Truly, a magical place. The happiest place on earth.",
          "Hongkong Disneyland is very amazing, cool, so much fun and worth having memory for me. It brought me back to my childhood heart of hearts. Everyone is having fun there. All walks of life, all ages were smiling and very happy and so excited. \u2026",
          "Great day out. Kids enjoyed it as much as I did",
          "The rumors are true. All the fun of Disneyland but with no lines and smaller size so can do it all in a day.",
          "So Happy to be here, most people also having the same feeling when they come this magician world, but unfortunately i came  here was late around 3 pm, then i decided only tour around the resort and magnificiant hotel with free shuttle bus and shop the souvenir and also taking picture.",
          "Disneyland is one of the place that can make you smile widely all day. What more to say? You can meet your favourite Disney characters,  enjoy the thematic rides, eat the delicious food, watch the shows and parade. One day is not enough to explore the whole area",
          "We had an amazing experience even the train line was magical. And you can buy tickets when you arrive no need to buy them early. The prices of the tickets has gone up a little bit. The park was very empty. We typically had between 5 to 15 \u2026",
          "Magical.. No place like it... Every turn is an adventure. From the train ride to the park you are in a Disney adventure",
          "Smaller than the parks in the US, but great to take your kids here, can do the while park in a day pretty much.",
          "Wow I did enjoy despite of my age \ud83d\ude01",
          "All of the rides were awesome but it was just too expensive as I have a big family",
          "Shorter wait times than other Disney parks, but far from empty if there's any occasion (e.g. golden week). Many things (mostly restaurants) were closed when we were there, but most of the time that wasn't a problem.\n\nIt's very small \u2026",
          "Great place to visit. Can't wait to visit again.",
          "Not as big as Orlando but you will enjoy the difference.  I loved it",
          "Had a great time here. Though many reviews said the place was small, I found they had enough attractions to keep you occupied a whole day. Recommended for family fun.",
          "Excellent place, my kids and wife enjoyed a lot. Worth visiting once a life time",
          "My 11month old daughter loved Disneyland Hong Kong. It was amazing, we had such a great day. Thanks Disney",
          "It is definitely an awesome place for couples and families. I was there with family in December 2018, during day time. I would love to visit the place again in evening, to admire the festive lightings, fun and adventurous characters.\nNot to forget the shops: Celebrity gifts, The Trading post, Andy\u2019s Toy box, Space Traders and many more.",
          "Very fun rides, there are many food options for vegetarians. There are also many new Marvel rides, such as the Iron Man ride.",
          "Great fun place, will be the child out in you.. Sadly the main castle were closed due to maintenance hence the 4 stars. Either way still alot to see and you will need the whole day there.",

          "Awesome experience, it was a great time pass and enjoyed all rides and movies, drama etc.",

          "Absolutely amazed after watching my favourite Disney locations and characters come into action.\nEspecially, loved the rides in the Toy Story Land and the Star Wars ride in Tomorrowland, highly recommend it.\nThis park is huge, so make sure \u2026",
          "it's so fun because when i was a kid i need to wait so long to take a ride but this time i just need to walk through the way to the ride and take a ride . ohh and also the customers are very nice the good is also delicious",
          "The Cinderella Castle  is still under repair so no Fireworks show at night. Because of the current status quo in HK, the lines in most tourist spots are very short.  You better take advantage of that! For food you should eat at the Mystic \u2026",
          "Theme park is great. Happiest place on earth and best place to relax. The rides are great. Friendly staffs, and excellent customer service.",
          "Amazing park and was enjoyable, but not the same as the Orlando Disney. This is one of the lesser ones, but is still a great place to visit. The rides are good, but lines can get long, depending on the time you visit. When I went, the train \u2026",
          "Visit was quite memorable, clean park, minimum wait with most rides. Easy to get to using public transport. Food quality was just okay. Unfotunately some of the facilities were under construction, and others out of service.",
          "I went Wednesday Nov 13 2019. It was CRAZY EMPTY. Rode everything I wanted several times, never a wait more than 5 minutes. \n\nFood is very pricey, much more so than Tokyo Disneyland that I visited a few days prior. But waits for the popular rides were close to 4 hours, so.",
          "Fantastic. Definitely worth it during lower occupancy days. Get there early to make sure you can try all the rides and activities. So much to see and do.",
          "The place had fun rides but they barely ever change the rides or shows are make new ones",
          "Enjoyable, but think they need to set up more fans during the warmer months. A bit too many people for a truly enjoyable experience. F&B are pricey, but expected for amusement parks.",
          "Really a good Place for holiday and so much fun in there",
          "Really great. Definitely something you should do",
          "My experience is just awsome..its a very wide entertainment park with lots of rides and fun..so much to see..i think its not cover by one trip..i tried to go there from my school days but suddenly my dad and mom offer me to visit with them \u2026",
          "Cool for kids despite its small size. Use klook vouchers to get some advantages",
          "Wasn't able to try all the rides, it rained heavily that cause to stop the outdoor rides and cancel the parade. Good thing rain stopped and they were able to have the fireworks display.",
          "My first visit to Disney land ever... It was amazing And a lifetime mem",
          "Great place for kids and kid at heart individuals. Amazed by the fact that the theme park closes at 9 pm",
          "Disneyland HongKong is a must visit place during the HongKong trip. The park being a part of Disneyland Family has all the popular rides and shows of Disneyland Company. The park is easily accessible by road or a dedicated metro line. One should reach here in the morning to cover all the rides. Enjoy the beautiful Disneyland.",
          "Small, but enough to spend at least 1/2 your day there if you wanna do a quick trip",
          "Great experience for family with kids. New comers please be reminded to get free priority pass to go for a shorter queue.",
          "On e of the accessible Disneyland for Indians when distance and affordability are main concerns.\nMainly focused on childrens and kids and they will enjoy a lot there. There were not much thrilling rides for adults but certain shows are \u2026",
          "Great park! Disney style nice staff and experience good rides for all ages and styles... small park so not a tone of walking \nFood well priced",
          "A small compact Disneyland ... Which means you won't leave feeling like you've seen everything. It's ... Disneyland, and the size is the main thing that's good about this one.",
          "Very awesome. So clean and very safe to hang out. Great place for my family",
          "Poor quality, sketchy food. Went for the 3 for 1 meal option with the ticket. Ordered the vegetarian option and kids meal at the international grill part of the banquet hall at 2pm. Spent a few nice hours with my daughter till I started to \u2026",
          "Iwe enjoyed it here! a smaller disney that we were able to do all we want in 1 day. Not too crowded when we came. No need for fastpass or long lines.",
          "Said the happiest place on Earth - I guess only if you are bringing energetic kids who would not tire easily. Otherwise, it's a huge place and I would recommend strollers to be rented or brought to ease tired parents. Lotsa rides for kids \u2026",
          "Some of the notable experiences:\n- Winnie the pooh ride.\n- lion king show\n- mickey's wonderous magic\n\nThe only dissapointment was that the castle is currently under renovation and the train rides were suspended.",
          "It's the most wonderful place in the world!! \nLove the magic there, all the shows are incredibly amazing. \nGoing on a weekday seems to be a wise idea! Came during the festive season, special parades are arranged!",
          "Convenience for Muslim tourist. Halal food at Explorer Club. Food portion is reasonable. There is also Quiet Room to perform solat on the next to Toilet at Explorer Club restaurant. Inside Quiet Room there are wudu facility",
          "I totally enjoyed my time at Hong Kong Disneyland.  A small park in comparison to what you're accustomed to in the US but there is a lot to do.  Would revisit for sure \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Hong Kong Disneyland is a great and fun place to visit. Kids and adults will enjoy themselves thoroughly. The staff are friendly and always willing to help. Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Pretty amazing how they were able to recreat multiple worlds in once place. Their performers make it come alive for Disney fans of all ages. You can spend a day here, roaming around and trying every ride and show out. Kids especially love it, a lot more if they grew up with Disney.",
          "Great! \nMy son loved all characters and enjoyed the theme concepts. Way too many photo ops.\nOption to go for 2 days, my family opted while I can join them for 1 day.\nIt could have been better experience if few of it were not closed due to technical faults.\nTheme Train ride was also nice!",
          "It will definitely bring out the child in you.",
          "U can enjoy many things inside",
          "It was not ok but didn't think the rides were great and all the food and drink is really overpriced and isn't that good either. However the staff are really helpful and freindly and I really like the unique Disney themed \ud83d\ude87 trains that you can use to get to the park.",
          "Absolutely magic.\n\nThis park is somehow more Disney than Anaheim. The spirit of Walt is very much in this park \n\nAfter the huge disappointment that was Paris only a week ago, my faith is restored.\n\nBeautiful park, amazing cast members. I cannot recommend this park highly enough.",
          "I love the place so much, but they should use english as a major language in plays, announcement and etc so that visitors from other country can understand.",
          "great time and great memoeries with daughter. a dream for her 7th birthday come true!",
          "Nice place, good for one day with family. But for 2 days there is too few to do from my opinion.",
          "A definite must do, despite the unrest in Hong Kong. Really brings out the inner child in you. Suitable for all ages. Be prepared to walk alot of course lol",
          "Simply amazing and I'm 84 walked my feet off ate, drank I was enthralled.",
          "Some bits under renovation but nice to experience it in the cool season!",
          "In true disney fashion, the atmosphere was great. The cast members were extremely polite and helpful. The only reason I have it a four instead of five is I the park is small so you can see it all in one day. Two days would be great if you do not want to rush.",
          "It is simply overwhelming seeing all your Disney fantasies come to life... suddenly you're a child again. If you are in Hongkong, dont miss it.",
          "It's great to go to HK Disneyland on a MONDAY. We got to ride the exciting Big Grizzly Mountain  Runaway Mine Cars TWICE!!! It's a great experience to go here with old friends because adults need some fun in their busy lives every once in a while.",

          "Come here early to fully utilize your tickets. The rides are nothing extreme but its fun enough.",
          "This is a must visit if you are in HongKong. \nI'd recommend buying vouchers via klook with the meals and snacks to avoid waiting in queues\nHyperspace Mountain, RC Racer, Grizzly Gulch, Iron Man experience was truly worth it",
          "Had a very fun rainy day here. Less people and basically no line up for any ride. Very different Disneyland experience that I'm used to. Usually the day is spent for lining up for attractions but this is probably the least visited Disneyland. Loved it.",
          "Good for family bonding particularly children",
          "I had such a nice time!!\n\nWe arrived at 9:30 to find that there were no lines basically \n\nEntry fee was about 60usd per person, seems steep, but since there were no lines all day it was totally worth it\n\nThe park is not as big as LA, but it \u2026",

          "can get very crowded on the weekends. full of tourists. worth getting the fast pass otherwise you send hours queuing",
          "Awesome experience with my kid. Food is ridiculously expensive but it's expected. Definitely will be back.",
          "We were there on 27th Nov 2019, due to Hong Kong issue, there weren't many people in park and most of the restaurants not open that time. The good is we able to try every game in the park with maximum 10mins queue.\nThe castle is under \u2026",

          "We were here a month ago.  We were pleasantly surprised by this Disney.  The best rides are the Grizzly Coaster and the Haunted House.  The haunted house is way different than the other Disney houses.  If you go its well worth it to purchase the express fast pass for all the rides.  We never had to stand in line for anything.",
          "Amazing experience.. The place is like a fairytale come true for any disney fan.. Luckily when I went there was not much waiting time for any of the rides.",

          "Disneyland is must see once in a lifetime but can be visited many times if you have time and money. Hongkong Disneyland is a relaxing place with many usual rides. Not possible to cover all because of time constraints and que. Don't miss it.",
          "There's not much people compared to the last time I went because of the protests. But still had a good time. We bought tickets and meal vouchers via Klook and it's worth it. The new Iron Man ride was so-so.",
          "Nice place to enjoy with Family especially Kids.... Most disappointing thing is that they have stopped the fire works....\n\nBut tickets from Klook as they give nice discounts",
          "Under reno,many attractions closed .However fun filled.",
          "Hong Kong Disneyland is also known as HKDL is a theme park located on reclaimed land in Penny's Bay, Lantau Island and is managed by International theme parks. The park consists of seven themed areas: Main Street  U.S.A Fantasy land, \u2026",
          "Fun and exciting. Wear your running shoes so that you don't get tired from walking all day. Prepare umbrellas too in case of rain.",
          "One of the best places to visit in Hong Kong! But it's not for someone who easily gets tired of walking. The themepark is biiiggg so you need to be prepared in strolling around the area. There are also shows to catch at particular hours, so \u2026",
          "The only place that makes me feel \u201ckilig\u201d the whole time. The only place I can be a kid again. The only place my childhood dreams came true. Really delighted to be back at this place and experience it\u2019s magic. Always a magical experience coming to Disneyland. I wish we have this in the Philippines.",
          "Woo hoo. At last my first Disneyland so excited. It is a bit old and worn and tired but I didn\u2019t care. Went on as many rides as we could. Yeah. We got the fast track ticket and it is money well spent to go to the front of the cue. Food as \u2026",
          "Awed by its state of the art technology. The rides were magical!",
          "Best to experience the park on the weekdays, I guess. We went on a Monday and was able to go through almost all the rides with less than 30 minutes waiting time. Some rides are even having only a 5-minute line.",
          "Smaller than Anaheim, but fun and entertaining as you'd expect.",
          "Wow nice place \ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\ude1a",
          "Hongkong\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0Disney land where you can see many characters is wonderful!  \nI went there in summer. It's too hot to go on the rides. So if you have an idea to visit there in summer, you must apply sunscreen and put your cap. There are many \u2026",
          "Amazing place, a bubbly , energetic, more excited kid will comes out when you are at this place, your age is not a factor, it's just a number. So, be a kid and go and enjoy it, it's really astonishing.",
          "It's impossible to come to Hong Kong and not go to Disneyland.  They refer to it as \"the happiest place on earth\" for a reason.  \nwe loved seeing the characters and watching the shows.  \nWhen we were there, the park was pretty empty due to \u2026",
          "Great theme park. Although it's not as large as the ones on US, it has quite a few different themes and a variety of rides for people of different ages. If you live in HK, you should definitely get an annual pass.",

          "Food was great..... Loved spending the day here.",

          "Really a very good experience to explore n dine. Highly recommended",
          "Initially I thought Disneyland is only for kids, but after visiting I realized it\u2019s for everyone. You will realize a kid inside you post visiting this Disneyland. You can spend one or two days here. It has lots of rides and theme based \u2026",
          "I LOVE THE PLACE....  ITS TRUE...  DISNEYLAND IS THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH",
          "It was a great pleasure to be there with mickey mouse & the friends and don't buy kids meal coupon",
          "A bit sad that we paid full entry to attend when only half of the rides and f&b outlets were operational due to strikes. The plus side we didn\u2019t have to queue for hyperspace mountain and rode it 3 times. The character experiences were fab especially the star wars one.",
          "Totally fun! A lot of experiences to be remembered. Only downside is the effort of walking most of the time",
          "Good place to bring kids. Fun rides. The wait times aren't fun though",
          "well it\u2019s super pricey. a meal is around ~100hkd so definitely recommend getting the annual pass for disneyland! however it\u2019s a must-go for the tourists!",
          "Best time to visit the park is during spring...A very nice place to have fun, even you're not a kid. I would recommend to take some rides. Especially  Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, that's awesome :)",
          "Took my wife and two kids aged 9 and 6, and had the best day ever. The lines moved quickly and all the rides were fantastic. The whole day was just so much fun with lots to do and all the staff were so friendly.  Would highly recommend to a young family travelling to Hong Kong.",
          "Another visit to HK Disneyland was actually better than my previous visits. The waiting lines were not long at all, average attractions\u2019 waiting time was only around 5 to 10 minutes. The food served in the park is good and is worth the \u2026",
          "Never a dull moment here \ud83d\udc9c",

          "Every one who\u2019s young & young at heart will love this place... Great for Family, & Friends to visit... With PWD Access. A piece of advice, wear comfortable shoes / clothes when visiting this place or better to bring extra . Souvenirs are \u2026",
          "It is fun and does not have scary rides",
          "One of the smallest, but best parks. Attractions may be limited but lines are short and there\u2019s always something to do!",
          "I've been to every Disney Park in the world, short of Disney Shanghai. I rank this park as a tie for #2, with Tokyo's DisneySea. #1 is Epcot for me. The mountain view is stunning, the castle is being redone, and the shows are out of this \u2026",
          "Perfect place to spending family\u2019s time ..",
          "fantastic place to spend your time wih your love one.",
          "I had enjoyed very much. It really is a nice place",
          "One of the finest theme parks in Hong Kong, this is must visit. Divided in 6 different sections this has all of Disney's creation like Mickey mouse, Winnie the pooh, toy story  based rides just to name a few. Do not miss marvel themed rides \u2026",
          "Always be have fun... A lot of joy here, and so many rides you must try.. they also have luggage deposit service here so you can enjoy your time and save your luggage right before you catch your flight home",
          "Epic epic wonderful. Doesn\u2019t matter if you are a kid or an adult. This park has literally something for everyone. Go there on a weekday and reach at the earliest because it closes early and you might miss some of the rides. The closing parade is very good. Everything closes that time so you have nothing but to enjoy the parade.",
          "Simply outstanding! EVERY single staff member is helpful and friendly and it\u2019s their sole focus to make sure you have a remarkable experience. The attention to detail is unbelievable, all gardens perfectly manicured, buildings designed \u2026",
          "Will definitely go back here again. Going on my 3rd visit! Hopefully the construction will be over soon, so we can watch the fireworks display.",

          "Been to all the USA Disney Parks. This one was very nice",
          "A very nice place to have fun, even you're not a kid. I would recommend to take some rides. Especially  Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, that's awesome :)",
          "Well it's was fantastic the most beautiful place to see love it",
          "a magical place that transforms you back to your childhood days",
          "I went here on the summer. Unfortunately that day was raining from the moment I get there, not just for a minute, but for some hours. But it\u2019s okay because you can buy a raining coat there or you can bring your own coat. It\u2019s really great \u2026",
          "It's equal to the size of magic Kingdom. Good 1 day theme park. Second day visit is o ly $100HKD more. There were no lines when we went, the longest wait was 10mins, that is nothing compared to peak times. The castle is still under renovation, that is a bit disappointing. All and all the Disney experience you expect.",
          "It's very kids friendly..  however not much the Disney characters are really quite long time ago..",
          "Perfect place to spend all day long",
          "Despite visiting during the renovation, the Disney magic was still in Hong Kong Disneyland. It has been a dream for me to visit Hong Kong Disneyland, and boy did it not dissapoint.",
          "Pretty good park but not as great as other Disneylands in other countries. The staff are all very kind and the rides are more for younger guests. Waiting lines are pretty short unless if you visit on weekends at peak times.",
          "I got hysterical.. I saw my boy Mickey . And the cute Minnie.. how I wish I could have coffee with them.. the place is already magical as it is.. colors, bright and dainty, food and drinks are Instragram worthy.. and the rides are quick but memorable.. I can still remember everything.. Beautiful!! Love it!!! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18",
          "Fantastic theme park I had dreams about it since teenage. Up-to-date, this park do not let me disappointed. Although it's, probably, the smallest scale in the world, I'm still love it that is HK Disneyland.",
          "Grizzly Gulch and Iron Man are by far the best ride in Disneyland. Dream come true. We'll definitely be back!",
          "such a fabulous and wonderful  experience . very enjoy\ud83d\ude01this place",
          "Just happened to stumble across the Halloween theme! Pretty decent little place , nothing spectacular and your usual theme park expensiveness.",
          "This could well be my favourite Disney experience. My six year old is age appropriate for 90 percent of the rides and activities and the park is smaller so easier to navigate with moderate queues too. Cast and environment as good as you would expect - it is Disney.",
          "Amazing, must visit - the night parade was spectacular filled with light & characters",
          "The most crowded Iron Man character meet spot for 50 minutes, otherwise it takes less than 20 minutes.  The castle was being renovated and I felt it was too narrow.  I think all the remarkable rides can be made in one day.  There are some vehicles that are not in Japan, but they are similar.",
          "Smaller park compare to other disneylands. But experience was really really good.",
          "Had a good time. Went on a Monday and hardly had to line up for anything. When there was a line it took less than 10 minutes.",
          "We visited HK disneyland three times, and it never failed in giving us abundance of fun for my family.",
          "Beautiful park, fantastic experience, excellent service!",
          "The only theme park recommended for tourists in Hong Kong. Beautiful and fantastic.",
          "LIKI TIKIS IS THE BEST ATTRACTION",
          "Despite the ruckus in its country, Disneyland ka still the happiest place",
          "Well... The price is almost as high as Disney world. But you can't compare the two. I mean - it is Disney, with all the characters, etc. And the shows are nice, with songs in English, and with subtitles for the talking parts. But you simply \u2026",
          "So many attraction..  if you're willing to go here then you must be go early morning",
          "Come here for the shows and spirit of disney. Rides are now much better than 10 years ago. A lot more stuff now",
          "All kids love here",
          "A good Disneyland park. Will be great when new castle is build as it missing that at moment. If you have been to other Disney parks you will feel at home just slightly different. Easy transfer from airport or Hong Kong city just use mta system it has its own train and station.",
          "Amazing park. Small like the Paris one but the cast members make it feel really special",
          "Fun place for family and kids. The staffs all work hard to entertain",
          "A bit disappointed with the ongoing repair of the castle and no fireworks display which I was looking forward to witness. This place is for children and child-at-heart. Please do not expect extreme rides here",
          "Nice compact Disney Park with friendly cast members and easy to get to by public transport. Entrance is relatively cheap and waiting times on the Sunday I visited were 10 minutes max. There are less rides than in the US and Paris park but \u2026",
          "The games are perfect for children. But the theme and atmosphere are not strong enough.",
          "Full of surprise everytime i visit here.  The night parade was not always the same.  U get some snow a couple of weeks before.  The next time u visit during visit,  u get xmas tree and lighting the star.",
          "It was super awesome. An experience never to be forgotten. So many intriguing museums, awesome entertainment and spectacular rides  to enjoy, 10 hours in the day is not enough to appreciate Disneyland HK",
          "We came here on a Friday knowing that school holidays has finished and kids have gone back to school to make sure we don't have to wait hrs for each ride. \nWe have been told that it is not as packed as it use to be so it is a very good time \u2026",
          "HK Disney carries much better merchandise than the Disney World in Florida or Disneyland in LA",
          "Hong Kong Disney provides the expected Disney experience. Staff are amazing- they treat customers well and are very helpful. We noticed the difference between HK Disney and Anaheim Disney staff which we visited within 4 weeks of each other. \u2026",
          "Pretty busy in public holiday, but still lines are more than bearable. The heat can get a bit much, bring plenty of water and maybe a personal fan. Food choices not great, not healthy either.",
          "This park is amazing with tons of things to do and it was really fun filled with joy and laughter",
          "It was so fun here! I loved the rides and my family really enjoyed here! I wish I could come back here! :)",
          "Big and need at least two day to explore all since the closing time is 8pm",
          "Pretty small, you can do this in less than one day if it's not too crowded. At this time (Nov/Dec 2019) it is very quiet because of the protests, which means there are almost no cues.\n\nThere are some fun unique rides for this park like \u2026",
          "Honestly, HK Disney land is small but I think Singapore universal studio is much much smaller. And you can come HK in autumn and winter season, much comfortable with cool air, not so hot. I think 1 day is just enough for play.",
          "Very clean place and good to go and see. Recommend that you go on all of the rides there as they are all fun and harmless to do. There are also shows that can be shown as well which are pretty cool to see as well. Bit of a shame that the cinderella tower was under maintenance though. Other than that good experience.",
          "Smaller Disney park with less stringent crowd control and management.  Overall very similar in amenities and gift shops, of course with a slightly local flair.  Some rides are quite different because of cultural differences (e.g., Haunted Mansion isn't as full of dead things and evil spirits)",
          "It is open late, try to avoid the peak noon hours as it gets very very hot!! \n\nThe parades are at 4 and 9PM so you get to enjoy them more in the evening. \n\nThe restrooms are a/c which is really funny as none of the other places are, most rides are non A/C.",
          "Smaller Disney Land but lines were short. Had a great time",
          "Feel the magic of Disney world! They will amaze you from the entrance through the day till it close. Make sure you buy some meal with merchandise like the mickey shape plastic glass, etc. Some advice, make sure you planned what to see or \u2026",
          "Best place the only problem is the rush over there otherwise it's excellent",
          "Loved it. Only been to Paris Disneyland before & this has enough that it is significantly different to feel like a whole new park. It's also better than the Paris one if you compare just the Disneyland parks. Also we went Aug 14th 2019 so \u2026",
          "One of the best \ud83d\ude0d Wish to be back again soon. I want to try other rides I haven't tried yet. 1 day tour is not enough! \ud83d\ude0c",
          "Still the best place for my kids to visit to. To be honest, this round of visit is the luckiest as no long queue in almost all points that we stopped by. As HK protest issue, I would say not many people come out and allow us to have chances \u2026",
          "In terms of design, Hong Kong Disneyland is easily far better than either of the Disneylands in the United States. The park is a joy to walk through and it makes up for its lack in a large amount of rides in the consistently high quality of those rides and the beauty of the surroundings.",
          "Fantastic place! Most of the visitors are foreigners and Hongkonger.",
          "Very nice place for adult and kids",
          "Good but disappointed that half of the rides were closed because of the lack of people staff on a week day. Unfortunately not as good as Paris or Japan",
          "Super nice as nice as disney can do.... all coaster is fun... not scary, but fun...",
          "Good, few people there during the week, and not too hot",
          "Went there with family this October 2019, and we're in for a surprise! Lines for the rides, food stalls and other attractions only take us 3-5 minutes. There aren't a lot of people visiting Disney right now so it's advisable to visit it.",
          "Even it is small but you still.fun enough, especailly with kids.\nProbably one of the easily Disneyland if you want to take photo with Disney characters.\nTwo shows inside are must watch.",
          "Excellent place. Really worth your money and time. This place is not only for kids but for adults also.",
          "This is the best place to relax and go back to our childhood days and enjoy the rides patterned after our favorite movies.",
          "I will never forget my experience here. The place offers a lot - a day is not enough. I'll definitely be coming back here. Try Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor and Ironman Experience - Three of  the best rides!",
          "If you compare to the nearest Disneyland (Japan) this theme park is a bit smaller, thus you may not find some of your favorite disney characters. But anyway, Disneyland is always a place of magic. It is a great place to bring your kids for a day of outdoor activities. Our daughter loved it very much",
          "Rides are so much fun and the park was not too crowded at the time on Dec 3 2019",
          "Excellent place for all those with kids. We enjoyed iron man experience... But not as big as the US Disneyland.. yet worth visiting",
          "One of the smaller Disneyland\u2019s which is what I\u2019m told. Again I got a really good deal due to the situation in hongkon g which made it really worth it",
          "Really enjoyed this wonderful place!",
          "A nice place to go \nGood for family and friends",
          "Small but lots of fun",
          "This place is the best to go if you're looking for thrill rides",
          "The happiest place. 1 day is not enough if you want to try all the activities.",
          "This is really the happiest place on earth!",
          "Its currently under some form of renovation throughout the property but you would not notice it much. The Centre piece castle is also undergoing work, so that rules out the evening fireworks display although the 7.45 light and sound show in the main street is still on.",
          "Happiest place on Earth \u2764\ufe0f Indeed. Must visit!!!!!",
          "The park is small, but really fun. The crowds were really minimal in October and you wouldn't need to do more than one day here. The transportation to the park is SO easy via the train. The mountain/bear rollercoaster is AMAZING.",
          "Loved it, friendly staff and extremely clean.",
          "Good to have annual pass",
          "It is good to know HK Disneyland will build more new games and attractions, the existing ones are not as attractive",
          "Nice place and have halal food",
          "Amazing! Exhilarating! Must visit!\nGreat concepts, brilliant execution. Absolutely loved the live shows. Iron Man, Star Trek, Mine Car and Super Car rides must absolutely absolutely be on your list if you love the adrenaline rush!",
          "Halloween time was very well done. I was impressed with the whole experience.",
          "Best place",
          "If I can only give this place more than 5 start I will. Best place to relax and be like a kid again. Perfect place to escape the stress of adult life.",
          "It is not too big but everything is well maintained and beautiful. We enjoyed too much. The food in hotel restaurant is pricy as expected but quite tasty. The waiting lines are short so you don't have to wait a lot. Absolutely recommend this place!",
          "Excelant\nMy note\n1- It's best to buy ticket online \n2- take fast truck ticket it's ok to pay more you won't wait in line \n3-Come early at least 9:00 am to be there\n3- Eat well before coming because the food or snack beverag too much\n4- \u2026",
          "It is truly the happy place because lots of disney characters are present during their parade. \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Very nice place...I want to visit again",
          "one of the few places on earth where you forget your age and play along with your kids until sunsets. every family member enjoys these places around the world.",
          "Brilliant Disney park that doesn't cost the earth to get in. Short queues that make it easy to do the park in a day and still meet all the characters who were as you would expect at Disney very nice to meet. The Castle was closed when we went but I'm sure when it reopens it will be super.",
          "Love this Disneyland, especially on quieter days it is possible to do and see the entire park in one day.",
          "Nice experiences here and many fun things to do. Queue not to long to wait for attractions like 30-45min for famous attraction. I recommended you to play ant man it was really nice. They have lot of restaurant in all zone you can choose by display in front of restaurant.",
          "Smaller than its counterparts but just as fun.",
          "I love the place..fun for the family..",
          "A must visit when you are in HK. The place with full of fun and joy. Kids would not be boring. Come as early as possible and queue on the most favourite game first. You would finish most of the games by evening.",
          "Kids entertainment world...everyone should take their kids once in their childhood days for beautiful memories.",
          "Hong Kong Disneyland is another Disney Theme Park in Asia after Tokyo Disneyland... Hong Kong Disneyland is not big but still nice and entertain.. The Disney Store is also packs with various kind of Disney merchandises with a nice discount for certain items... It is a great place to spend with kids during holiday...",
          "Great park but the castle was on maintenance on the day I was there.",
          "My 5yr old niece enjoy it so much, I can see why it's called the happiest place on earth. There were some rude staff hence the 4 star but it was a really enjoyable experience.",
          "Smaller than Tokyo Disney, but ANY Disney is a 5 star in my book. They have an amazing senior discount and the most adorable \"train\" cars to get you from the main train lines to the entrance.",
          "awesome experience.. everything was too good from the rides to the washrooms and the food outlet..",
          "Although the smallest Disney park by far, it does lend for a very enjoyable day with family especially with younger kids. But even then going with my family (youngest being 18) it was still fun as we still enjoyed the kiddie rides such as it's a small world.",
          "Ohhhhh wow what a place,A must visited place in Hong Kong,I love it",
          "Wonderful experience! Be prepared for long ques with waiting times 20-30 min. Take an umbrella in case of freak down pours. No rain was forecast but there was a 30 min down pour.  Download the app, it shows waiting times for rides as well as show times.",
          "The crowd is not as much as before. It's the best time pay a visit during the year.",
          "Beautiful.... Big garden.... Nice beach also....",
          "Not much to see. By far ny least favorite disneyland. Its small. Supposed its the smallest disneyland.  Place was clean. The castle was so small, even so i went there went its on construction.",
          "Awesome place for quality family time.",
          "It\u2019s a happy place. My kid loves this place.",
          "Really good rides with great facilities, hotel rooms and attractions. Enjoyed my stay. A bit expensive, but worth it. A great throwback to childhood memories. Well written shows too.",
          "Nice to have some fun and be yourself as a child",
          "Great experience, but lack of signboard. Especially lack of info about timing for having a photograph with Donald Duck!! \ud83d\ude2d I think i must go back here again in other times \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Another magnificent and well designed Disneyland in Hong Kong. It is not as big as the the one in Anaheim, California but very adventurous. The lines were not as long as the other Disneyland we have been to. I was thinking of getting a two \u2026",
          "Its a great place for all age group. Carnival fantastic. But its a great disappointment to notice fireworks are cancelled",
          "I never been Disneyland theme park before as I always compared it with Ocean Park coz the only thing I can correlate them is the motor games. Speaking of motor games, Ocean Park is for sure way more exciting & intense than Disneyland. \u2026",
          "Loved this place!! Fully of activity, vibrant energy and fun. Kids fantasy land in real for sure!",

          "The least hospitable place to build Disney Land is Hong Kong. Although the park os itself extravagant but you cam never forget that it's in Hong Kong.",
          "Visit with children.  They will enjoy the day.",
          "Great experience lots activities.. Better to buy two tickets starts and the all priority like vip.. So you don't have to wait for the long ques in whatever activity you want to do",
          "Quite a bit smaller than Disneyland Anaheim or Disneyworld. We were able to get everything we wanted to do in 1 day. Wasn't quite the same feel you get from the USA parks. But overall it was good.",
          "My Ed Sheeran concert here was very poorly managed we stood in the rain and were given no further information until they cancelled the show due to lighting... after most of it had passed!\n\nThey gave out free plastic raincoats, which were left in a pile as the show was cancelled. \n\nNot very conscious!",

        "wiki": "Tai Lam Tunnel (Chinese: \u5927\u6b16\u96a7\u9053), running along Tsing Long Highway, is part of Route 3 Country Park Section (R3CPS) and is a transport link between the western New Territories in Ting Kau and Yuen Long.\nTai Lam Tunnel was constructed to ease traffic congestion at Tuen Mun Road, Tate's Cairn Tunnel and Castle Peak Road, and to link traffic directly from New Territories West to urban areas of Kowloon West and Hong Kong Island, the Hong Kong International Airport and the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals. Located adjacent to the boundary crossings of Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay, it connects smoothly with Shenzhen and Guangzhou for serving both cross-boundary passenger services and cargo logistics.\n\n\n== Toll area ==\nTai Lam Tunnel is a 3.8 km (2.4 mi) dual 3-lane tunnel. The total length of the R3CPS (the tolled area) is 10.1 km (6.3 mi).\nThe tolled area, with two entrances/exits at the south end, Ting Kau Bridge and Tuen Mun Road at Ting Kau, crosses Tai Lam Country Park to its north end at Pat Heung.\nLocated at Pat Heung and about 1 km (0.62 mi) from the north tunnel portal, the toll plaza consists of 22 tollbooths, 16 of which are for manual tolls and 6 are Autotoll lanes.\n\n\n== Construction and operation ==\nTai Lam Tunnel is a Build-Operate-Transfer (B.O.T) project with a franchise period of 30 years (including construction period). (Cap 474 s2 on \"franchise period\") Its total construction cost was HK$7.25 billion. Construction on Tai Lam Tunnel started on 13 March 1995 and was officially opened to traffic on 25 May 1998 to match with the opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport.\nThe designed traffic capacity of Tai Lam Tunnel is 140,000 vehicles per day. In 2011/2012, the average daily traffic was over 54,000 vehicles.According to the statistics from the Transport Department of the Government of Hong Kong, Tai Lam Tunnel has higher-than-average safety records. In 2011, the accident rate per million vehicle-km was just 0.07.\n\n\n== Tunnel tolls ==\nThe tunnel is well known for its high tolls similar as the Western Harbour Tunnel. Its toll for private cars is HK$48, making it the second most expensive tunnel in Hong Kong; the most expensive is the Western Harbour Tunnel at HK$65. For coaches, it is the highest in the city, about 4 times higher than the longer Tate's Cairn Tunnel.\n\n\n== Environmental protection and sustainable measures ==\nThe tunnel company performed compensatory tree planting at a rate of three replacement saplings for each tree felled. In total, 250,000 trees, 150,000 shrubs and 60,000 climbing plants were planted during the construction period.\nAs to conservation of wildlife, there is a small tunnel constructed at the south portal of Tai Lam Tunnel, mainly for small wild animals in this area to commute in the valley freely, allowing them to maintain their habituation.\nTo keep in pace with technology development, Tai Lam Tunnel has gradually replaced traditional light bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The indicator lighting signals inside the tunnel tubes and at the toll plaza as well as the illuminating system in the administration building have thus been replaced for reducing carbon emission.\n\n\n== Bus Routes travelling through Tai Lam Tunnel ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTai Lam Tunnel Bus Interchange\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRoute 3 (CPS) Company Limited",

          "Going to the Peak is a must-do. Paying extra to go to the top of the Peak Tower is not. The views are amazing from any of the floors on this building, as well as the free observation deck on the building right next door. Getting the ticket for Peak Tower Observation Deck added",
          "This is simply a shopping mall, so I wouldn't rate this listing for the view it offers. Just that it charges people to get to the observation desk puts me off. That too, when you have the shopping mall across this, offer the same views for free. On top of that, there is",
          "We actually went up on bus 15 from Star ferry which was much cheaper than the tram and lots of interesting views as you wound your way up so didn't purchase any of the packages for viewing or things here but the free view from the Galleria level 3 or the walk along to Lion",
          "The view from up here was simply beautiful, we spent well over half an hour admiring the view and taking photos. They only gave us free headsets and tapes for audio guides. They distracted the kids for a while, but they also enjoyed it. Pretty great for photo ops as well. The",
          "We booked advance, return tickets from klook.com. It was a very sensible thing to do. We were picked up at Central Station, from where we walked to the Peak Tram (base) station. Its important to know that the Victoria Peak tram is the best way to reach both the Peak tower and",
          "As i mentioned in my review on the Tram Before you get here, be ready for the long line and que. Check the weather! It's mostly foggy here and you cannot enjoy the view when all you can see is fog. Once you're ther and done taking photos, the only next thing to do is to leave.",
          "Best trip to the peak is via peak tram than up the roof of peak tower, spectacular views and plenty of room for lots of photos! It is definitely a tourist hotspot! Worth the visit but please try not to come on weekends, otherwise would be too crowded to enjoy the views!",
          "Easy to get to and great ride up on the Peak Tram. Stunning views of the islands. Good tram ride up with lots of oohs and ahhs as the city starts to disappear",
          "Worth heading to the top of the tower for the 360 view that you don't quite get from the bottom. It wasn't too busy during the week.",
          "Situated at the top of Victoria a Peak, the Peak Tower which doesn't really suit being up there as its a little out of character provides on a clear day great views of Hong Kong. Also within its confines are a small wax museum & gift shops. Accessible by the Peak Tram funicular",
          "The view from the platform on the top is truly spectacular. Can't say if by day but the night we visited it was clear, warm and beautiful. To get to the viewing spot you have to get through many floors of shops and restaurants that are very overpriced so I didn't really enjoy",
          "the view from this place cannot be any more spectacular its really amazing, you can see the whole of HK from here and the islands around, in the tower you will also find very nice restaurants and stores as well as the wax museum, the entrance fee is reasonable, but the prices",
          "But still worth the trek. There's lots of restaurants, all with kids menus, and better prices than some of the restaurants down below. Pass on all of the souvenir shops, and visit the markets for some more affordable souvenirs.",
          "Going up to the Peak on the tram and then seeing the views from the Peak Tower is a great way to spend the day. The view is fabulous. There are quite a lot of shops at the Peak and some very good restaurants. Towards dusk it does start to get very busy with people wanting to see",
          "A must visit to view the fantastic skyline! It was indeed amazing to watch the view from one of the tallest buildings in the world. Spent around an hour being mesmerized by the amazing harbour line and skyscrapers around!",
          "We lived in HK for 8 years, have visited the Peak often and did the hiking trails. Had never been up so a few days before our departure decided to bring my twins at sunset / night time. $98 for 1 adult and 2 9 year oldsis reasonable. However, they allow way too many people up",
          "The trip on the Tram is one of those things that you must do during your visit. The Peak Tower however is boring and designed to fleece tourists of their money",
          "There's a shopping mall inside, and several escalators that take to the summit, where you can have an amazing view of the city. There's also a little exposition of buildings and projects from HK and Shenzhen.",
          "Eat and drink before you come, as everything is overpriced, and a walk through the mall is unavoidable to get to the viewing area. BUT VIEW IS WORTH IT!",
          "You can either walk or catch the Peak Tram up. If you catch the tram up the price includes the Peak Tower and you get an audio tour included. Views are spectacular on a clear day but even if it is cloudy you can still see a lot.",
          "On a weekend day you will be competing for space with fellow tourists. It can get quite intimate as kids and adults alike breakout their selfie sticks and wave them around like swords. Don't waste you time visiting on a fog filled day as you will see nothing even though you are",
          "Bird's eye view is not my favourite view point but this one deserves a visit, because the view consists of houses from near to far, not one on top of a 100th floor building where everything is far away. You can ride the tram up (uncomfortable though) but take the bus route down",
          "you need a good day to have beautiful views of Victoria harbour, but i have been to the peak when it was a bit cloudy. There are many restaurants and a mall as well, but you are coming for the view.",
          "The view from the top of the PEAK TOWER is spectacular. Many changes/additions were made to the Peak Tower over the years. A MUST visit.",
          "Incredible view when clouds are not closing it) take a tram to get there, nothing special but will give you a nice impression.",
          "If you have a clear day - and especially a clear night it is worth paying the entrance fee for the view which does include an audio guide. Come here on the 15 bus rather than wasting money on the very overrated tram. The shops inside though sell lots of tourist crap and I am",
          "It's a great experience and a wonderful sight to behold above Hong Kong. When the sun already set and the lights started to light, the view is wonderful. You can get here by the peak tram, bus, or taxis. Be aware that the bus queue after dinner is long.",
          "The tower, also called the Sky Deck 428, is essentially a shopping complex with a terrace at the top where you can look over the Hong Kong City. The views are great, the shopping less so - I didn't go there to go shopping.",
          "The shape of this building is unusual. It looks a bit like a bird ready to take off from the top of the peak.",
          "Must visit if you are in Hong Kong. Amazing view of Hong Kong. Good in the day but amazing in night.",
          "The Victoria peak park is a best location which gives a fantastic view of the Hongkong sky line. Though a bit crowded the place is breezy and is an enjoyable location. The way to travel up is on the peak tram and the journey is breathtaking",
          "Peak tower include in Peak Tram prize, but if you want to top of tower, you need to buy extra. We did it and it is good place to take photos. Souvenirs are quite expensive. Take your time, there is in the evening lot of visitors.",
          "Very nice to view the building jungle of hong kong..recommended to all tourist who came yo HK. The tram is a good way to go but the bus are there also for extra budget..",
          "It's the Wandering Yank here. Mrs. Yank and I took the Peak Tram (see my review), which drops you off at the Peak Tower. We wanted to see the 360-degree view of course, so we had to go up a number of escalators. And it was gorgeous, despite some clouds and haze. The Tower",
          "One of my favorite place in Hong Kong.. Excellent view , excellent taste restaurants , easy connection & transportation and enjoy the place",
          "This is worth the visit. Make sure you take your camera. To use this facility I recommend using the tram which will the tram ticket will include admission to the Peak Tower. I recommend coming up on dusk to see the views during daylight and night.",
          "I lived near by and went to buy some take away and boy, there must have been hundreds of visitors lining up for the peak tramp going down town. The line for buses are a little better so the lesson is simply to avoid weekends. Driving is another option but the car park is very",
          "You may have read that if its the one thing you must do in HK, its the peak. Well, I disagree. So, you have to decide whether you want the traditional Hong Kong tram experience or a view of the skyline from a perch.If its the former, you are at the wrong place. At 83 HKD for a",
          "You have to pay to get to the top, like similar attractions (Empire State Building, Willis Tower, Tokyo Tree, etc.) The view is great, but it is crowded. In the end, it is worth doing just to see Hong Kong from a different perspective, but be prepared for a typical tourist",
          "Been here more than once with different group of friends. Only the peak tram gives you the thrill. Other? Just a city and harbor view from above. Nothing more. So this time of visit is kind of boring for me... Walked around the area, having some gelato and took pictures with",
          "Take a cable car (tram) ride up to the tallest peak in Hong Kong. The views are magnificent, but make sure you have a clear day, otherwise you will see absolutely nothing. Night time is the best as the Hong Kong Metropolis is abundant with lights and designer lights on a lot of",
          "While it houses the Wax Museum and at the top is a great view - the tower itself is really just a shopping centre, and it has shopping centre shops, many of which I felt were a bit overpriced due to its location and the amount of tourists milling around.",
          "Loved it. My favourite venue inaude is Bubba Gumo Sheimo Co. We went to the Peak Tower by Peak Tram which is fun in its own accord. Lots of shops and things for the family to do.",
          "teh day we went was shocking weather - but there were still things to see and do - it wasnt over crowed, wax museum was ok - bubba gumps was yum",
          "No place like it. The view and supporting infrastructures are great. Truly a marvel to behold. The price of admission is reasonable. Despite being a Sunday, there are adequate places to take photos and take your time to rest and just soak in the view. The Galleria is beautiful",
          "Klook has tickets which has option to bypass the tram line going here. Not much to see inside except for a few stores and diners. If you can eat at the Bubba Gump at the top level and ask to be seated near the windows overlooking the HK skyline.",
          "I have visited the peak many times almost on all my visits to Hongkong, it is relaxing and different every time. View is good all Hongkong is sky terrace ticket is 48$.",
          "This is highlight of Hong Kong and a MUST visit if you happen to be in Hong Kong. The way is very exciting in Peak Tram and there is more excitement to follow when you reach. It gives a 360 degree view of Hong Kong with audio / video tour giving you all the information that you",
          "The best view in Hong Kong,and food and service that is super. You feel that you are in elegant restaurant all times. Walking around the grounds is a wonderful experience. So high above Hong Kong you look down on sky scrapers. Heavenly to say the least.",
          "15 years ago when we were at Victoria Peak, the Peak Tower was not yet built. This time when we visited the peak, we saw a unique looking tower standing tall on the peak. You can take the tram to go up and prepare for a long wait. There is variety of souvenir shops but bring",
          "One the best places to visit in Hongkong. Try to visit in the early hours to avoid crowd. Reach Peak by Tram is must to experience. Lots of shopping and eating options plus other attractions gives you a lot to do in one visit.",
          "Hong Kong being concentrated with high number of person per square meter, the Peak Tower is a great escape from the massive crowd. With an easy tram ride to the top of Victoria Peak, getting away from the crowd become an easy escape route. The facilities within the Peak Tower",
          "Went early to avoid the crowds and it worked. The morning is the time to visit. Brought the ticket which included the view point at the top of the tower with the tram ticket as you get a slight discount. Didnt go into the wax museum so cant comment on it, however in all the",
          "We visited here before lunch time and on Tuesday, still no crowd at that time. There is peak market here, which sell so many souvenirs. If you want to see HK from the top, just go to sky terrace. You can visit Madame Thussaud here and take a picture there.",
          "Perfect to be here during late afternoons! Soak in the view or have coffee and watch people go by...",
          "There are a multitude of stores with an expansive variety of souvenirs. The Wax Museum is also located there. The tram ride is well worth the wait. The wait depends on the time of day and can run 2 hours!!!!!!",
          "I had to spend 2 hours buying tram ticket, and spent another hour queueing to board thetram. It was quite an experience, taking the tram uphill. But the time i wasted to queue makes it less exciting. At the peak, its exactly just another typical shopping mall. What",
          "There is a perfect 360 degrees view from the top of the tower. You have to pay a fee to get there. Many restaurants and shops make it possible to spend some hours enjoying the good view of HK.",
          "Bit of a tourist trap. you have to climb 5 floors full of shops and corporate restaurants before you get to the top .The views from the top are fantastic and you get a free headphone guide to use when on the viewing platform. In my opinion try the restaurants in the mall",
          "Since our trip coincided with Lunar New Year, we arrived at the bus stop at Central at 10 am. to beat the crowds. A full bus was just departing, so after an easy wait, we boarded the next bus for an amazing ride, complete with switchback and hairpin turns, up to The Peak. We",
          "Another area for great views of the city. It is fun all the way to the top. They have many stores along the many levels with lots of eateries along the way",
          "No visit to Hong Kong would be complete without a visit to Victoria Peak (either by tram or bus or both). As covered in various websites, the Peak itself has countless viewpoints as well as footpaths for getting amazing views. However, the Peak Tower is an eyesore, full of",
          "Going to the peak, being there and coming back was a pain. It is too crowded and mismanaged. there are long queues to get in there and then finding a place to get a good view of the city is a task. Photographers capture all good spot with their clients and create a no mans zone",
          "A quite exceptional view from Peak Tower over the harbour and islands around Hong Kong. Choose a clear day and prepare to be astounded. Not to be missed on your itinerary!",
          "It's December 31st when we visit The Peak. Its definitely a must go! We've just took a cab up there because the queue to ride the tram was ridiculously very very long. Like you will stand there for the whole day. So we recommend to get there early to avoid the long queue.",
          "If you want to (and you should) the best of Hongkong's Skyline, this place is it, take the tram, the bus or a taxi.",
          "Strange that the Tram to get to the top rates as one of the 10 ten things to do but the view at the top doesn't! Perhaps TA should link the two so that this does not get missed because it is worthy of the number 1 spot. The building itself is iconic, lovely piece of structure",
          "Ride the Tram to the top and then go to the observation deck at the top of the Peak Tower! Amazing views in all directions. It's especially spectacular at night. If you go at night, be there for the 8:00pm laser light show.",
          "The best place to view the city. Take the peak tram to reach the peak. Special tickets are available to view from the top most point of the peak.",
          "The architecture is really nice. It dominates the Victoria peak. However, it's not necessary at all to pay the entrance fee to climb up to Terrace 428. The view is almost the very same as along the path east to the building which has its view points and is totally free. There",
          "Worth paying the small extra fee to get to the view point at the roof of the tower. You get access to the everything in the tower except the viewpoint with tram ticket only.",
          "The view from The Peak is absolutely amazing - but remember, that during the hongkong winter, it can be quity windy and cold, so make sure to take some warmer clothes. If the weather is good, reserve some time to take a walk around the Peak - there are some interesting paths",
          "I think it is worth to pay extra to enter the Sky Terrace or the Peak Tower. You get an audiotape where you learn a little about some of the buildings you see below. There are restaurants in the building but most were full so expect to wait for a table or take a cab and find a",
          "My family love to gonup the peak everytime we were in HK, just a tram r ide and a walknaround the mall. We had steak lunch at the Spagetti Pizzashop which a bit disappoitment but seerve us rifgt sincecwe were spposed to eat pizza in a pizza shop .ha ha",
          "A nice clean shopping Centre, with a good range of shops, free Wi-Fi, some great specials. A good range of eating places, the grocery store, and lots of tourist trinkets available\u2026 A few high end shops as well.",
          "This is probably one of the best places to enjoy the amazing landscape of Hong Kong. The sky terrace (48 per adult, can get a peak tram package as well) is well positioned, and is beautiful at night. There are a few other places here and there to enjoy the view for free, but",
          "It's really something you need to do when in HK. The tram is the fun way to go up there but lines are often long, so, having done this before, I took the 15 bus from Central bus station which takes you to the top for less than $10 ($2 if you have a senior octopus card. There",
          "The views are amazing, the food in general is pretty average and expensive but the views as you eat are incredible. The views from the top viewing gallery are simply amazing. Make sure you come up by the Peak Tram . Last time we ate at Bubba Gump and the food was better than",
          "A must do once if you visit HK, if you get a good clear day than great views and photos, however if it is smoggy it can be a little disappointing. Lots of shops and restaurants that cater for families.",
          "Best spot to enjoy HK city from outdoor. Can be reached by peak tram (most of the time always crowded but great experience), bus or taxi. There is no attraction here so just to enjoy HK city. Both day time or night time also great",
          "The 1st time we went to Peak Tower (Summer 2014) by peak tram. We bought 3 in 1 package ( return peak tram + madam tussaud + sky terrace ) 300 hkd. The 2nd time we went to peak tower by taxi ( Winter 2015 ). Only 15min from peak tram station to peak tower by taxi. 50 hkd ( 4",
          "Totally worth visiting. Along the way you can enjoy the beautiful view of the Hong Kong cityscape. When you get to the top, it's even more amazing. I do like the audio gadget guide that gives you a bit of a historical trivia about each part of the cityscape. There are also good",
          "I would highly recommend visiting. The Sky Garden provides some of the best views of Hong Kong. It was amazing to see Hong Kong from this perspective. The Peak Tram to reach the Peak Tower was also fantastic.",
          "Probably the best views of HK skyline. This tower completes your trip to the Peak, riding on the legendary funicular to reach the peak and then taking in the stunning views atop this tower. Super!",
          "The peak tram is awesome and when you get up to the top, it is quite stunning to look out over HK. The city is incredible and the view absolutely exquisite. We have been a few times and it is definitely worth doing at least once.",
          "We were originally concerned about going to the peak with our 5months old baby as she is still breastfeeding and constantly requires attention. As best as we could, we fed her and prepared her before leaving. But it was all a wasted effort as there was long queues to get on the",
          "take the train, it smells after tourists and it is - did we do this, YES I confess we did - was it disappointing NO - was this wonderful NO. was this average YES - can also take the bus there and enjoy the view from several points - take Ocean park for views of Hong Kong, much",
          "Very commercial but worth the ride up for the tram experience and the views. Can be busy but for good reason. Hard to beat the views, day or night, from this classic HK spot.",
          "Certainly the best views of Hong Kong are from The peak Tower. Just go for the views if you want but there is so much more to do than just the views.",
          "a must see place in Hong Kong. best accessed by the Peak Tram. Houses the Madame Tussads wax museum, shopping arcade, restaurants, cafes and the highest point in hong kong observatory. best in evening during sunset and when hongkong lights up the night sky. windy. cold in",
          "Provides a great view of the city at night. Would have enjoyed it better if the weather was not too hot. However, the last time I visited it, it was a cloudy day and we could barely see anything. The place was too crowded though",
          "This is about as high up as you can get on the peak, so it's worth going once, particularly if it's your first time in Hong Kong.",
          "Unless Sky Terrace has come as a combo ticket, it\u2019s of no worth to even pay for this place. It\u2019s the top most floor of the multi storeyed shopping complex built on the peak over the peak tram station. While I agree that you get to see good views of the HK skyline, you can catch",
          "The Peak Tower offers a magnificent view of Hong Kong, together with audio guides that come in many languages. However, we chanced upon the customer service centre (hidden in an old isolated tram in front of The Peak shopping centre) and the friendly service staff recommended us",
          "We went up here for the second time. Awesome views of Hong Kong. First time we went up during the day and wow, second time was a little later and it is such a fantastic view! What a memory!!",
          "Sky Terraces, Maddam Tussaud's, and the Peak line can be found here. Great View of the Hongkong skyline and whole city as well. there are many shops as well as restaurants that you can check.",
          "Get there early. Great views unlike any other although it is a bit pricey, Afterwards there is a nice restaurant near by.",
          "Excellent almost 360 view of Hong Kong. Food and shops abound. Some cheap, some quite pricey. But definitely must try and worth the fare and time.",
          "If you take the Peak Tram up to Victoria Peak, you will inevitably find yourself in the Peak Tower, a small but maze like building intentionally designed to keep tourists inside. You have to wander around for a few minutes, passing souvenir shops, wax museum, overpriced tourist",
          "Get a ticket at the bottom and go up the staircases to the top. You get an audio guide that describes the view. And, yes, the view is very impressive. If you can take the time (and stand the heat), walk around the peak in 45 minutes.",
          "The views from the peak tower are amazing you get to see most of Hong Kong from the top. There are plenty of shops and restaurants, so it a lovely place to spend an afternoon",
          "Wonderful experience. Me and my husband totally enjoyed the fresh experience of this timeless beauty. This place wont ever age. As this place witness people from all around the world enjoying the magnificent view of the entire hong kong skyline, the peak tower draws its beauty",
          "The Peak Tower is a leisure and shopping complex located at Victoria Gap, near the summit of Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong.",
          "Reaching this point in the Victoria Peak, you can take very nice pictures of Hong Kong and Kowloon skylines. Font's miss this point for a invaluable selfie!",
          "Yes, this is the place where all those picture postcards of HK are taken, lovely strange building housing really odd things like Ripley's believe it or not. Most certainly worth a visit if only for the tram ride.",
          "I really don't understand the appeal of the Peaks or the train ride to get up there. Yes the view is great and nice things to see but really given the cost of getting up there on the tram and with only shops to spend your money I am not sure of the appeal. I think Hong Kong is a",
          "Highly crowded location with multiple nice view points including somewhat expensive sky observation deck. this place is always crowded. My recommendation is to go early as 9 am by taking the tram to the top and return by public buses. You can avoid being in long queues",
          "The view from the top makes this place a must. Truly beautiful!! The resteraunts in this place are quite expensive though, we walked elsewhere. But view from the top is what your here for",
          "Purchase a train ticket & took a train up the peak. While we are on the way up to the peak, can see many different view of the city, houses, the sky. its a wonderful experience. When we reach the peak, the view is different. Shopping area is normal, the food is normal.",
          "Inside The Peak Tower were many restaurants, shops, toilet, Tram Ride Terminus, Sky Terrace, Museum, and the Peak Market for souvenir hunter. If you had no time for buying souvenir, better to go to this Tower. Many things could be done in one place : tried peak tram train, saw",
          "On the building (galery) next to the tower the platform is free. Or you can walk 100m to the left when you leave the tower and go to the lions pavallion. It's free and has the same view...",
          "I think the Peak Tower is totally over-rated. Nothing really special, except for the good view and the Tram.",
          "It is a must to visit in HK. Amazingly you can see the whole HK in 360 degree view from the highest point in HK. You can see and recognize all attractions of HK from there using a free device and a map which gives useful nice info about each. There are also some traditional and",
          "Incredible building with breath taking views. Well worth the tour. Well set out and easy to get around.",
          "taking the tram to the top was really an experience. It's weird and hard to explain. it is so steep the hill feels flat. When you get to the top, the view is breathtaking. There are also little shops.",
          "Great view, plenty of shops for souvenirs and eating. Worth a visit if you are at the peak. Take the tram up and enjoy the sights.",
          "The Peak Tower itself is a mall with plenty of restaurants, fast food chains, dimsum house and souvenir stores. But the most amazing part of the tower is the observation deck where you can see Hong Kong Island in 360 degrees.",
          "There is a fee if you want to go to Sky Terrace 428, but Sky Terrace Garden is free. The only difference of the two is that in Sky Terrace you will have a virtual tour. But the view I think they have the same, except that Sky Terrace is higher than Sky Terrace Garden. But either",
          "There's a fee if you want to go the rooftop and watch the view of Hong Kong island. It was quite expensive.",
          "Cannot see the point in paying extra to be a few metres higher. The view doesn't changed. Would much rather pocket the money and enjoy a coffee instead",
          "Many local and foreigner get there and take many photos. It is because there are many good restaurant and places to relax.",
          "as most places in Asia there will be a huge line ... but worth it anyways ..also some interesting stores and eatery",
          "This is an unsightly blot on the landscape with yet another unnecessary shopping mall. The view from a couple of hundred metres down the Peak trail path is the same and is free so I really do not understand why people pay to get the same view from the top of this eyesore. Even",
          "We bought the access to the Skytower as a combined ticket with the Peak Tram. In hindsight we need not have bothered as equally good views can be gotten for free from the Peak Loop walk and the Galleria shopping centre both of which are nearby. You do get an audio guide which",
          "the peak tower is where the peak tram will drop you. the multiple floors have shops & restaurants. & on the highest floor is the sky terrace. the shops are mostly for apparel and we ended up picking a windcheater as it was quite cold up there. you can stroll through all the",
          "We visited here after going up Victoria peak on the peak tram. We paid $48hkd each and went to the top open floor to experience amazing views of the stunning city. This roof top terrace is high but has the advantage of supposedly being able to see 360 degrees at Hong Kong but",
          "Paid extra to go sky terrace 460 is worth it as it offer bird's eye view of Hong Kong. The view is stunning!! Must go",
          "The Peak has definitely changed over the years and now there are more retail and food outlets to cater to tourists' needs. The best place for a great view and nice photographs of Hong Kong's skyline. Tip: If Lantau Island/Big Buddha is also in your itinerary, be sure to keep",

          "Many had tried taking the tram up to the peak, especially if that was their first trip there. Be prepared for long queues. With the strong winds up in the mountain, it may be better to take the tram up (sheltered waiting area) and catch the bus down. The bus starts and ends at",

          "You'll realise that it's not cheap once you get to the top. Though the view is spectacular, the self- guided tour is crap. Plus the headphones they supply you with is of cheap material and the sound is muffled - and it stinks to high heaven! Imagine all the thousands of ear",
          "The Peak Tower was full of shops for the tourist trophies and franchise restaurants, as well as Madame Tussaud - all geared up for the big sell - but after navigating the kerfuffle the views from the Peak Gallery were well worth it. Still can't fathom what Forrest Gump was",

          "Don't let the location (right after you leave the Peak Tram) fool you - this is a shopping mall, disguised as a touristic attraction. Make sure not to go up the escalators to its top, as it's useless. You can have a wonderful view of the city from the peak itself and you don't",
          "Usually when you enter a theme park or ride, you will exit via a souvenir shop. This place does the reverse when you enter the souvenir shops first from the Peak tram, even before you go to take in the views at The Peak, the only reason why you are here. They don't even warn you",
          "Tower, which cost $ to enter did not dramatically improve the view you got for free. If you are trying to get the most amazing picture of HK, then The Tower could be worth it. If you are happy with pretty much the same view, but slightly less elevated, then save your money for",

          "It was impossible to take the classic tram, so we took the normal bus to go to the top. In the end we made the best choice: the tram is not worthy at all and it's just a waste of time! The view is pretty unique, even if it's always very crowded with photographers or tourists. IF",
          "Dreadfully commercialised if you ascend by the tram. Such a pity really. I fully recommend the No. 15 bus unless of course you are feeling energetic and want to walk it. Don't spend the money on the peak tower as there are perfectly good views from the shopping mall beside it",
          "Hey I know its Hong Kong. This is a world class view and a must-see. But I can go to Bubba Gump and all that other stuff at any major tourist location. Ruins everything. and The HK $40 to get to the top is a rip as well. But in the end, I paid the forty bucks. Don't wait",
          "The view is not to be missed but do yourself a favor and skip the slow tram, its long lines and its occluded view and take a taxi instead. You waste a ton of time getting to the top by taking the tram and it doesn't really offer much. Despite the smog that usually covers city,",
          "The top of Hong Kong is defiantly worth visiting and on a clear day must truly be fantastic. We were unlucky with the time of year and there was a lot of mist or smog. The area on top is nice and there are walkways going in both directions. I recommend going early in the",

          "BEST VIEW everrrrr... but cost us more, if we want to go to the terrace.. on the terrace is basically only taking picture, quite pricey for an extra 40 HKD..",
          "I would say the place is definitely worth visiting at least once for taking great pictures of Hong Kong and just relaxing enjoying the view. In fact if you go on your own to explore the peak you will be able to see the good views yourself for free, but to stand on the platform",
          "Due to the mist in Hong Kong visibility is limited. If you want to save time not only money just climb on top of the mall you will everything without having to pay the extra 30 HK$ and will not have to wait in line. You will see all the city from up there.",
          "We decided to visit late in the afternoon so we could see the daytime and the night time views - it was well worth the effort! The views were superb. Our whole experience, from the tram ride up, shopping, the views (both day and night), and dinner at Hong Kong Day restaurant,",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to the peak and are glad we saved it for a clearer day as the views are spectacular. A real wow factor and great pictures for the album! Lots of shops, cafes and restaurants nearby to continue enjoying the view. We went for the professional photo which",

          "There was a discount if you had an octopus card and went out on the open observation deck. The view isn't much better then you could get just looking from the top of victoria peak to the skyline below. Inside the building is a number of eateries and stores selling souvenirs.",
          "U can choose whether u want to go inside the peak tower because there is a fee if u go inside. The purpose to go into the peak tower is to see the view of HK but u can get that around the Victoria Peak. But maybe, u get better view from the peak tower. It's ur choice.",
          "If you bought a Peak Tram ticket you can go up the Peak Tower for free, otherwise it costs $40 HKD extra. The view on top of the Peak Tower is worth every penny of it.",
          "This place is a MUST for your Hong Kong Trip. But I mean for the outside of this building and not inside. I really enjoy the weather of this place, abit cold and strong wind. But you can also see from here to the Victoria Harbor. But strongly advice, don't take tram to this",
          "The view from the top is awesome and well worth the trip up alone. The tower is also a shopping centre and is very busy filled with tourists. There are also some restaurants but mainly chains. There is a waxworks museum but we didn't go in their (extra cost). All in all the view",
          "This so amazing. Take the cable car from HongKong up there. Go in the end of the day, so you have the afternoon there, and STAY.. see the sunset and all the lights over HongKong be turn on. This is simply a most do if you are in HongKong. It is a beautiful over the hole city and",
          "We wanted to take the tram for up-hill climb but ended up taking one of the bus services as trams are usually very crowded and you need to wait in queue, sometimes hours for your turn. The roadway was fine, obviously it was very zigzag and it took us about 45 minutes to reach",

          "Night time view is nice....keep in mind this place is buy with many tourists. There are plenty of places to eat and many special add-ons to make your viewing sight memorable. Don't buy any tickets to see higher. You can see a lot without buying extra tickets. Don't waste your",
          "Its the best view of Hongkong Skyline during the day hrs. Also the Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum is in the premises. One can get here in the evening to see the view in daylight, spend time in was museum and later enjoy the night view. The place has good number of dinning and coffee",
          "Some may find this a bit overrated, however my husband and I quite enjoyed paying that little bit extra to get great views of Hong Kong Harbour. We were lucky we had clear skies and sun so the views were much more spectacular. A definite must see and do in Hong Kong!",
          "loved the view, it was spectacular. The ride to the peak was amazing. The kid's enjoyed it a lot. The only thing we didn't like was the weather, it was so hot during our visit.",

          "Amazing view of Hong Kong glad it was a nice day could imagine its quite cold on a bad day,food was really good we must have picked a Good day because it wasn't busy which was a bonus would defiantly recommend a visit.",
          "the view from the sightseeing platforms are great. other than that it's just a shopping mall. food is the same price as the rest of hk, it's good that they're not marking it up just because it's on victoria peak and it's a big tourist attraction.",
          "Very nice view of hong kong from the peak tower, but other than that, there's nothing special about it. It is especially windy at night, so do put on an extra coat if you intend to go to the peak at night!",

          "this tower is located in Hong Kong Island. To come to this tower, you must use the Peak Tram. The must try Tram in the world. The view from the tower is also good. if you have plan to visit this tower, i suggest you to come in the afternoon or in the evening. Cause the view is",
          "The tram ride in itself is really interesting but there is so much more at the top, The shopping is very good in fact I think the shopping there has the largest range of souvenirs. We actually visited it twice as we were not able to find souvenirs like that anywhere else. Good",
          "No matter what: you have to visit this place while in vacation to HK. Now named as Sky Terrace 28, this place offers a sky observation binocular (if you want to use it, spend your HKD 5), plus a very beautiful view of city, hill, the landscape below, and the mall. Worth to visit.",
          "The Peak is a must-go place if you visit Hong Kong. Points to share: 1. You can go there by the special tram (in Admiralty), or by bus no.15 (in Central). Only around 20- 30 minutes from Central to the Peak if you take a taxi. 2. Many choices of food at the Peak, from fast",
          "Went to the top of the peak by bus - mad bus driver who stopped for no-one! Unfortunately couldn't see much due to bad weather but worth the trip anyway. Good viewing places, free binoculars and free wifi. We came back down by funicular - another new experience.",
          "The Peak is worth checking out if you want to catch a great view of the city below. Best to go at night as the daytime might be covered with smog. Be prepared for long queues...The tram ride up amd the spectacular views are worth it. Get your tickets before hand or use the",
          "again a bit disappointing as it mainly is a shopping mall with stunning views and some average restaurants",
          "Atop The Peak you can wander onto the main element that allows you to view awesome shots of the city below: the Peak Tower. This place must be paid for in order to gain access onto the platform. (I was not aware of this when I first purchased a ticket which ended up being only",

          "Was there around 1030am on a Sunday morning. The view though was misty with the morning mist, was still very much picturesque. I would say that the observation deck is a must try, else there isnt anything much to do in the Peak Tower, just souvenior shops and restaurants. If you",

          "With an altitude of only 552 meters, there\u2019s no other better place for you to see Hong Kong than the Peak. Other than the observation terrace by the Peak terminus, where most of the tourists stay for the view, there\u2019s a walking loop trail (Lugard Road/Harlech Road) that allow",
          "This tram is a great way to get to the top of The Peak. Even on a busy day with good views, if you buy your tickets in advance (combo with Big Bus for example), the queue is not too long and it wold only take 30 minutes to get on a tram and to the top.",
          "Interesting architecture, But no real reason to be there other than for the peak tram station, A few shops but many can be found a 100x over in the city so nothing really new or unique. I don't understand the point in most of the shops but there was a few decent shops at the top",

          "The lights are very beautiful, especially if you go to the top. But remember to bring jacket because its very windy and cold at night. The package is much cheaper if you buy return tram ticket plus the tower view. Ask for the package in the tram ticket counter.",

          "Visited with my fianc\u00e9, very romantic, not really for children, more for adults, well that's what I think anyway. You can take a bus, car or the local tram to the top of The Peak, I suggest taking the tram, it's nicer. When at the top you'll be able to see practically all of",
          "The ticketing queue was really long but it was worth the wait. Take the right side seat of the tram, you will get to see the view of city on the way up the hill. I went up the Peak at night so the view of HongKong was amazing!",

          "Getting around in Kowloon & Hong Kong Island is so easy, Trains, Bus, Ferries, The buses do not give change so have some small change with you. Trains & buses have ticket machine`s for fares. We went by train to H/K central, Bus to the Peak, Tram back down .Open top Bus around",
          "We loved the Peak Tram, its history and its views. However when one arrives at the top of the peak one is deposited into a huge shopping centre tower ~ the peak tower. We arrived about 8.30 and hardly any of the towers shops were open ~ yet is took us about 15 mins to get out",

          "With so much of our traveling done underground, it's difficult to get a perspective on the entire city of Hong Kong. The Peak solves this problem! The tram ride was a blast, steep at times, but fun. The view is amazing. Lots of cheap stalls selling typical market fare.",
          "Not my first trip to Hong Kong and not my first trip up to the Peak Tower Sky Terrace either. You can get there by finnicular, bus, taxi and by walking (I believe), it is worth the entry fee to have access to some of the best views in town. Hong Kong is an amazing city to look",
          "That pretty much sums it up. It's worth seeing and going up, but it's clear that the peak tower and all the shops and restaurants at the top is a huge tourist birds nest. Best to get onto the lovely green trails straight away after the tram ride. Overall worth it. But after",
          "If you want to see Hong Kong from the top, you need to choose a clear day. There are nice sites to walk up from the Peak Tower which are just about 20 Minutes walk away. The Peak Tower itself is just the place to arrive by tram and then walk off. Rubbish tourist shops just walk",
          "The peak tower is a good aerial view of Hong Kong and the tram to the top is an experience. Make sure you go as part of a tour as there are lenghty queues, which are bipassed if you are part of an organised tour. At the top there are plenty of places for photos and a shoppin",
          "Near Central, you can catch a tram that takes you up the mountain to The Peak. Once you pay the reasonable fee to ride up, there is a shopping mall (they are everywhere), several restaurants, and vistas. We ate at the Chinese restaurant. It was surprisingly good although pricey.",
          "The peak and its Peak Tower are a MUST-SEE in Hong Kong. You wont regret the visit because you are rewarded with one of the most spectacular views of hong kong. The tower now started to charge an entrance fee but is still worth it. My tip is to go there around 5pm. This way",
          "I had to convinced my girl who wanted to do some shopping to come to the peak with me. We took the MTR to the central station in HK and walked to the peak tram station. When we got there the line was already long, so we stood in line for about 40 minutes, when we got to around",
          "Visiting the peak was an amazing experience. It is situated about an hrs drive from central hong kong. When u go to peal and look down it feels like the whole of hong kong is at your feet blinking like crazy in the night. It is a must visit place in Hk,higher on my list then",

        "wiki": "Cheung Tze-keung ((1955-04-07)7 April 1955 \u2013 (1998-12-05)5 December 1998) was a notorious Hong Kong gangster also known as \"Big Spender\" (Chinese: \u5927\u5bcc\u8c6a; pinyin: d\u00e0 f\u00f9h\u00e1o; Jyutping: daai6 fu3 hou4). He was a kidnapper, robber, arms smuggler and was wanted for murder. He was best known for having masterminded the abduction of Walter Kwok and Victor Li, son of Li Ka Shing.\nHe was sentenced to death by a court in Guangzhou and was executed by shooting on 5 December 1998(1998-12-05) (aged 43).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCheung was born in the Guangxi province, and moved to Hong Kong with his family at the age of four.\nHe acquired the nickname \"Big Spender\" for his love of lavish living. Cheung created a self-image for himself of a \"likeable rogue with a heart of gold,\" and gave his friends and strangers gifts funded from a crime spree that brought in at least HK$2 billion.He was said to be a charming man with a taste for fine food and liquor. He reportedly gave away tens of thousands of dollars to a young street painter when in Bangkok. Just before he was arrested, he spent a month in a luxury hotel in Shenzhen during which he showered hotel staff with tips. Even in jail, he reportedly asked wardens for bird's nest soup.\n\n\n=== Criminal life ===\nI haven't the patience to work for a living. In this world, money is the most important thing.\nCheung partnered with Yip Kai-foon in a series of armed robberies. On 22 February 1990, he raided Kai Tak Airport where he hauled a HK$30 million consignment of Rolex wristwatches. On 12 July 1991, Cheung returned to Kai Tak, where he robbed a security van, netting HK$167 million, Cheung was arrested in September 1991 and jailed for 18 years for the security van heist. However, he was acquitted and released after appeal in June 1995 when the judge ruled there was no case against Cheung as the evidence was filled with too many inconsistencies and the security guard who initially identified him recanted his testimony. His associate Yip, however, was sentenced to 41 years in jail.\n\n\n==== Kidnappings ====\nI take unconventional steps to get rich. Money is the most important thing in life but it's only me who can pull off kidnapping tycoons.\nOn 23 May 1996, he kidnapped Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, son of Li Ka Shing, and on 29 September 1997, he kidnapped Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties. He reportedly reaped HK$1.38 billion in ransom money from Li Ka-shing, and HK$600 million for Walter Kwok. Cheung admitted he followed Li Ka-shing, then held him hostage in the Li's own house for three days until the ransom was paid. It was believed at the time that these ransoms would merit an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records.Cheung fled to China in January 1998 after failing to kidnap Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan, in retaliation for the jailing of his associate, Yip Kai-foon. Acting on a tip-off, the police discovered 818 kg of explosives in Sheung Shui, a part of Hong Kong, in January 1998 which they attributed to a plan by Cheung to bomb government buildings. Cheung allegedly acquired 960 kg of explosives in 1997 for $200,000 from a man in Macau, the stock was transported to Hong Kong and buried in a deserted container parking area.Cheung had already fled to Guangdong province in January 1998 under an assumed name, having bribed the police there.  He was arrested in August 1998, and his gang of 35 were rounded up by mainland police. Among his gang members were 17 Hong Kong residents and 14 mainlanders.It was reported at the time of his capture that Cheung planned to kidnap Macau gambling magnate, Stanley Ho. Cheung is known to have lost at least $200 million in Ho's Macau casinos. Once losing over $25 million, in just one session at the casino.\n\n\n=== Criminal trial ===\nCheung and his gang were tried in connection with a number of crimes including the kidnapping of two Hong Kong tycoons, who remained unnamed in the trial (some reports suggested one victim was Victor Li).\nThe trial was held in Guangzhou even though the events occurred in Hong Kong. Cheung's lawyer, and other constitutional experts, lobbied the government for the trial to be transferred to Hong Kong, but they were rejected.The Guangzhou Municipal People's Prosecutor formally charged Cheung and his 35 followers with a series of charges relating to \"cross-boundary crime including illegal possession, transporting and smuggling explosives and firearms, robbery and kidnapping\". The charges, which were denied by Cheung, included the abduction in 1993 for a four million yuan ransom of a Fujian merchant who had only come forward after Cheung's arrest. The trial began on 8 October 1998. It was reported that Cheung made a full confession on the first day of the trial.On 12 November 1998, Cheung was convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed by shooting on 5 December 1998 in Guangzhou.\n\n\n==== Legal controversy ====\nThe trial of a Hong Kong resident in Mainland China engendered a crisis of faith in the judicial independence of Hong Kong, explicit in the Hong Kong Basic Law that had been implemented after the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty to the People's Republic of China in 1997. Grave concerns were expressed by the Bar Association that the Mainland had no jurisdiction over crimes committed in the territory by Hong Kong residents as a matter of Mainland law; the Hong Kong public were concerned that if they commit a crime in Hong Kong, they might have to stand trial in the mainland if arrested there. However, the Chinese Government argued that though the crimes were carried out in Hong Kong, they had been planned in China, so the PRC was entitled to exercise jurisdiction over the case. Under the Chinese Criminal Code, a Chinese national can be tried by a mainland court for crimes committed outside China if the offence warrants imprisonment of three years or more. Officials believed that although a \"meagre part\" of Cheung's case involved the mainland, it was right he be tried there.Grenville Cross, Director of Public Prosecutions of Hong Kong, said in a letter that the mainland judiciary could not return Hong Kong residents to Hong Kong before they had been tried for crimes allegedly committed on the mainland. Cheung's lawyer suggested there probably would have been insufficient evidence to convict his client in Hong Kong without victims' statements.The failure of the victims to report the case to the Hong Kong Police had left them bereft of evidence to request the repatriation of Cheung. Hong Kong Secretary for Security Regina Ip regretted that the tycoons had reported the abductions to the PRC and not to the Hong Kong authorities. She said there was no formal cross-border agreement on the transfer of offenders, but said that it would not be unprecedented to do so. Legal experts suggested that Hong Kong courts would not be able to convict in the absence of witness or victims' testimonies or other evidence, even with a full confession, as confessions can be withdrawn. There were some who maintained that the Li and Kwok families could get their revenge on Cheung since a trial in the mainland could guarantee the death penalty, whereas capital punishment was not in force in Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Cultural influences ==\nFictionalized accounts of Cheung Chi Keung's kidnapping of the wealthy have been made into movies:\n\nOperation Billionaires (\u300a\u9a5a\u5929\u5927\u8cca\u738b\u300b; J\u012bngti\u0101n d\u00e0 z\u00e9i w\u00e1ng; 'Terrible Thief King', 1998 film) starring Simon Yam.\nBig Spender (1999 film) starring Ray Lui Leung-Wai.\nTrivisa (2016) portrayed by Jordan ChanChasing the dragon 2 (\u8ffd\u9f992\u4e4b\u8d3c\u738b) 2019\nBig spender starred by Tony Leung Ka Fai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nWong, Kam C.

It is part of the Ping Shan Heritage Trail and a declared monument.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nAccording to Tang Clan legend, Tsui Sing Lau was originally located at the mouth of Deep Bay. It was built at least 600 years ago, by the seventh-generation ancestor, Tang Yin-tung, to avoid evil spirits from the north, prevent floods and help the Tangs win a title in the imperial examination. Numerous Tangs have been granted titles. It was declared a monument on 14 December 2001.A further Tang legend relates how in 1382, Tang Yin-tung dreamed that a group of stars all gathered together and dropped onto the place where the pagoda now stands. Tang was reminded of the words of a fung shui master who had complimented the good fung shui of Ping Shan, but who also gave two comments on its geographical weaknesses. The Tangs had not fully comprehended the second comment, so Tang Yin-tung immediately consulted a Fung Shui master. The master advised him to build a Buddhist pagoda on that spot in order to gather the 'scholarship' for the clan, hence the name. After the building of the pagoda, the Tang clan produced numerous scholars and officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties.Built on a low foundation, the hexagonal pagoda is believed to have had an initial total of seven floors, but this was reduced to three due to erosion. It is made of mud bricks and granite. Fui Shing is worshipped on the top floor, where the words Over the Milky Way was inscribed. Fui Shing was a god who determined which scholars were to pass examinations and receive titles. The words The Pagoda of Gathering Stars and Light Shines Straight Onto the Dippers and the Enclosures were inscribed on the second and ground floors respectively.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPing Shan\\nArchitecture of Hong Kong\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nTsui Sing Lau Pagoda on Antiquities and Monuments Office website",

          "I was walking past to see a friend and at first i thought it was a private residence... with a party going on as the usual party crashing world explorer i am it turned out to be a great experience during the evening... i killed my battery taking photos! Then lost the photos...",
          "Spendid China is a great place to visit to see a miniature representation of the major sights in China. Located in Shenzhen in a \"park-like\" setting, it is a great place to take children that enjoy the outdoors while enjoying seeing China's sights.",
          "If you visit Window of the world, you will see all landmarks of the world in one place. If you are visiting Splendid China Park, you are visiting all china in one place. it's very beautiful and I loved this place. Do not miss it!",
          "A good site that you can spend 1/2 day at. There are regular buggies hop on hop off and the exhibits are good with adequate explanation in Chinese and English",
          "Splendid China is a trully experience. A lot of miniatures show the several regions of China, including mini Great Wall and mini Forbidden City. The circuit ends in a Chinese Villa, with restaurants and shows. A must see in Shenzen!",
          "Nice day for a visit after lunch. Go for a walk to capture all the beautiful attractions in the park. Just stroll and explore.",
          "If you want to spend a nice afternoon, possibly with the family, this is the place. Huge park with plenty of attractions. you have to spend at least 4 hours.",
          "If Shenzhen is the start of a longer trip through China or if you want to come back to this country and don't know where to go, then you might like to wander in Splendid China park where you'll see all the great attractions in China, in a miniature scale. It's funny otherwise",
          "China Folk Culture Village is full of little houses supposed to depict the \"56\" ethnicities of the country. Even though it might seem a bit weird (like a \"human zoo\") it's actually very interesting and some horse-riding shows from Mongols and Manchus in traditional costumes make",
          "It is a great place to explore The country in a day, a lot number of live shows that we keep you enjoyed",
          "Well worth a visit. Very close to the metro with good directions. There is a lot of walking and lots to see. The shows are excellent. Make sure you see the horse riding and don't miss out on the mask changers! The food was very traditional.",
          "If you want to look at all Chinese marvels in a short time and in a cheap way this is exactly what you need. Mini copies of a lot of Chinese architecture ensembles, from the famous Great Wall and Forbidden City and up to remote mountain villages and Buddha statues. I was",
          "Much like Window of the World, Splendid China is meant to showcase major attractions. This time, it is the tourist attractions of China as opposed to the iconic sites of the world",
          "This is a nice place to visit and walk around for an afternoon. It's not the most exciting or thrilling place, but it's a relaxing trip. The translation of Chinese signs is a bit odd in most places. It's located very centrally so it's easy to get to and from from most places in",
          "It's a nice enough way to spend an afternoon but the whole place could do with a bit of TLC. There are some good views of the surrounding city. It's a good place to visit but not at the top of my list of things to do in Shenzhen.",
          "Interesting for those who likes Asian specially Chinese culture. But better to visit in Winters, Summer too hot to enjoy Splendid.",
          "This is a great place to visit . It showcases all the cultures and ethnic groups that are related to China . Very relaxing and well designed . Entry fee is reasonable and you can hire an English Speaking guide if you want . Very interesting place to go . A must do if you are in",
          "It's the sister park to Shenzhen's Window of the World. It shows miniatures of all the types of Chinese Architecture from History. It's a very large park so take plenty of water with you. The park also offers other attraction such as a horse show, a karate show and tradition",
          "See all of China in one place!!! Giant Buddha statues, palaces, temples, waterfalls, suspension bridge, monuments, statues and ancient cities all in miniature replicas of the originals. River boat rides and a fun zip cable ride over the river. The afternoon apparel show,",
          "I am personally a fan of the Asian cultures and Splendid gives a great insight in what is or has been important for China and what is part of its culture. The park is quite big, so if you would like to see everything, make sure you have the whole day and energy to walk around.",
          "The model buildings and monuments were very interesting, having seen a few of them for real. The museums were also pleasant to stroll around. Highlights were the shows staged at various points of the day. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The park offers a good glimpse of Chinese diversity. The show with horse-riding was fun to watch (but note when planning your visit that most shows take place in the afternoon). Note that the park is quite vast. Conveniently there is a metro station right by the entrance of the",
          "Me, my sister and my mother had no intentions of going to splendid China but somehow we ended up there. We took a chance and went in. Splendid China shows the actual arts,culture and history of China. They are very cordial and audience friendly. There are various shows",
          "great place to learn about culture and traditions of China. Make sure to have enough time for walking around and for splendid shows they organize. it was a big surprise that in the evening they organize water battles. it looks amazing both at night and during daylight times",
          "Upon entering Splendid,China, you will receive a brochure. This attraction is very large and actually didvide into two areas. It is important that you plan your tour around the major events or shows, so it is a good idea to sit and plan your day. This definitely is a full day",
          "This was a fabulous day in a beautiful park which showcases the ethnic village diversity of China. The entrance fee includes admission to all the shows, the horse battleground, the folklore apparel show and a spectacular finale, the dragon phoenix acrobatics, special effects,",
          "The day was very hot and there was no airconditioning in any of the facilities. Other than that, it was a fascinating day stepping in to al the 55+ cultures that make up the China provinces. I engaged some of the authentic people representing the cultures. Perhaps the most",
          "So many folk and tribe of China you can watch here. The culture that is vary and original will always make us admire the richness of China culture If you are in Shenzhen, this is just one stop you need to make to see Big China from small presentation.",
          "This place is underrated in my opinion. Unlike elsewhere in China, almost noone comes here which lends itself to relaxing walk through the wonders of China. The exhibits are very well done, many shows take place throughout the day and food and drink facilities are available. You",
          "Most people don't know about this place and it is definitely one of the must sees when in Shenzhen. The park offers great opportunity to immerse in Chinese culture without travelling through China. The exhibits are well done, the ground is spacious with electric bikes and",
          "Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China are both in the same park. Get off at OCT Metro and take exit D. Walk straight and you will see the park on the right. It opens at 10am. The admission fee is 180 yuan which you can access both the Folk Cultural Village and Splendid China.",
          "a very nice park demonstrating a little bit of what China is all about. Do not take the mini electrical car because it goes very fast and you will not be able to actually see anything. Better is to walk",
          "As i wrote in my previous review Nanshan District itself too beautiful to visit while visiting Shenzhen, This Chinese folk culture village is one of the best place and MUST SEE place while visit at Shenzhen, here you can see entire history of china under one roof, Chinese",
          "First off all Nanshan itself is beautiful district of Shenzhen city and this park is amazing,though you need to have atleast 3 hours time to visit this place properly though it's totally worth it if you are history lover or not! this miniatures are superb preciously made that",
          "You can feel traditional chinese culture here. It takes about 2~3 hrs to look around all places. There are three or four restaurant and snack bar. You can enjoy chinese style lamb skewer!",
          "Splendid China is an amazing walk through some of China's most important towns and cities. Located in Nanshan, approximately 20-30 minutes from Shekou, this beautifully sculptured park is really worth a visit. Each of the miniature towns have been superbly recreated in detail",
          "for those who have not been to China, it certainly is a window to see the major attractions in half a day but in minature, indulging in the cultural performances as well as savouring the titbits and food from various cities, suitable also for education to learn about the",
          "As a China zoomed in, detailed, there are most of Chinese famous places. You will be pleased with designation of this park such as many trees, lowers, resting benchmarks, performing area. If you are tired because of walking, you can rent horse or self-driving cars Be careful",
          "A good insight into some of the culture of China and in a safe and nice place that is relaxed and enjoyable. the only thing is that it is specifically for tourists.",
          "If you go to Shenzhen you must to go to this place. Is good to start early, because is to visit all day. The best part is at evening with the presentation of the circus and dances. To visit all ancient architecture and see how wonderful is China, the Culture behind. I",
          "This was a beautiful Garden area with lots of history on China. I enjoyed the many buildings and statues. Beware-they do not speak any English here. So I did not know that there were bicycles you could rent to get all over the park...which would of been so nice vs. walking the",
          "If you are looking for inspiration for things to experience in China it would be recommended. The place itself is not very impressive and I would say not worth the money.",
          "Do not forget to visit Chinese Folk Culture Village during your trip to Shenzhen. The most interesting part for me was the tribe villages all around China.",
          "Hugely built and miniatures to the detail. Must watch.. Do get s portrait painted in less than 20 minutes with the artist in the complex.",
          "It is divided into two parks. One is a miniature Park and folk village is a showcase of all cultures within China. If you plan to spend a full day, hire the electric vehicle and you can roam around in it and enjoy the park. If you have been to Windows of the world, the",
          "I'm bored just thinking about this boring place. So boring. So incredibly terribly boring. Yes, its tiny villages. Wow. So boring.",
          "Despite its attempt to be a cultural doorway to the past, it just isn't authentic enough to achieve that. I go here for long walks. Kids will be completely bored in ten minutes. This is the place to go to de-stress and escape from the Big City, nothing more.",
          "Fabulous tourist park with replica houses from Chinese Provinces mixed with amusements and China in miniature! Not expensive on about 180 rmb so \u00a320 and you could easily spend the whole day there. Worth a visit!",
          "It was nice to see all the different Chinese cultures all in one place. Although my 8 year old didn't like it, The grown ups enjoyed. If you don't like walking, you can rent a golf cart (timed basis ) up to 2 people and drive around the park.",
          "Splendid China is a great place to visit for couples, or families. The grounds are beautiful and a high level of detail has gone into creating the miniature versions of iconic scenes gathered from across China and scaled down to a size that enables you to experience many of",
          "Came in with tour arrangement and only have 1 day to explore Shenzen. Found this attraction quite interesting but too bad did not have enough time to explore as we need to go inside the stadium to see the dance show.",
          "This is a combined Park. The miniature Splendid China and the insight in the broad variety of cultures in China. Start your visit with the Chinese Folk Culture Park. After your entry to the right. Take the time to visit the variety of houses and cultures. Be in time for the",
          "This time my second visit with different group.of friends. I love the scenery and landscape of this China man made park. Beautiful China traditional house, beautiful landscape and garden although some of the trees or flowers are fake! They made from plastic! But we found the",
          "We spent half a day there and was only able to see half the park. Get a mobile scooter if you want to see the whole park in a day but you will miss a lot. Best to walk if you can. Seniors get in for free (at least we did). park is adjacent to OCT metro terminal and is very easy",
          "we spend full day here. fee to enter is 180 RMB per person. if you do not have time to see all china, this is a place to see it all, Bejing,Shanghai,.....",
          "I really love this place! It's massive with all the attractions. Managed to watch the horse-riding battle and also many cultural performances!",
          "We came here on a day trip from Hong Kong as we were on a 3 day layover in Hong Kong, so we didn't know what to expect. We were very, very pleasantly surprised. We spent only 2 hours at the park as that is what Splendid Travel, our travel agency has planned for us, and it was",
          "This is a TOP sight in SHENZHEN, CHINA. All visitors to SHENZHEN must visit this sight, even the TOP officers from BEIJING. The sight starts from the day when SHENZHEN moves from a small village to be reformed into one of the top financial city in the south rivals even SHANGHAI.",
          "Amazing china famous miniature. It has 2 great performance. Awesome lighting, costumes, stage design but their stories isn't quit good. Awesome lighting, better come till night. Rare staff can speak english. Must check visitor paspor",
          "It was very exiting tour where you can see many culture sites of China, status and other objects, it was easy to go there using taxi, the ticket price is not expensive, it was very exiting tour and I advice tourists to go there during their visit to China, cheers",
          "The park itself is a bit cheesy. The best part of seeing a mock up of the Great Wall and other all China heritage sites is the walk around the park. The cultural dance show was amazing. Different styles representing different Chinese ethnic groups and provinces made the visit",
          "An nice day out to see artworks or all types and the markets are great if you time it right. A variety of handcrafted items such as paper carving and sketches and there aremany shops with pottery and various other Chinese cultural activities.",
          "5 minutes after arriving we wanted to leave. Hot and many people. However we rented a golf cart to drive around splendid china, which goes through many different areas and periods of time in China's history. I am so glad we stayed as we ended up having a fabulous time there.",
          "Got here only to watch the show There are two show, indoor and outdoor show The indoor show is a bit boring, I fell asleep during the show But the outdoor show is amazing, you can see a cultural show with acrobatic scene Really worth the watch",
          "I was not really sure about going there, some friends recommended it so I went, and this place was my BEST experience in Shenzhen seriously, I took so many selfies and pictures of the magical places, even if I went alone, everyone agreed to take pictures for me everyone is so",
          "Although the entrance ticket is not cheap, there are 2 main sights. One of the, is Splendid China, a miniature China if you like and a village show casing the 56 races in China. We took the donkey cart as we had 3 kids with us and R the rate of RMB400 for some75 min of guided",
          "Okay so this park is huge, there is a whole mini china which is wonderful to see everything China has to offer in miniature. Its a cannot miss park. There are different areas to see, such as a lake, shows,etc. The animal area was disgusting, the poor monkeys were caged in a",
          "Nice Park in Shenzhen. Just outside the OCT Station (green Line) take Exit D and you are there. It is nicely made and you can see all or almost all landmarks from china as mini replicas. The Park seems pretty well maintained and clean. I visited also the Horse Battle Show. Was",
          "There is NOTHING of historical value in Shenzhen so they built this. It is sort of run down but a good place if you dont have time to see other parts of China. Just know that this is a tourist trap and the great wall is not so great. It is 12 inches tall.",
          "This is a nice park in an interesting set up. Many elements of chinese cultures can be seen, either as buildings, mini parks or shows. There is a small train you can take through it, will stop wherever you want. Great fun for a couple of hours",
          "If you don't have a lot of time to see a lot of China it is a great way to get an insight into the diverse cultures traditions and landscapes of all over China. I think it is worth seeing. Plus Windows of the World is next door that was fun too.",
          "Out of towners step on the models to take pictures of themselves on them even though clearly marked to stay out. Bumpkin behaviour typical of some people here. Not enough guards. You can tell a lot of work went into making the models and I wonder what the artists think of",
          "Great place to visit. It is a virtual visit in the whole China. One need to spend 1 full day to see every single miniature.",
          "The Chinese Folk Culture Village is now unified with the Splendid China Park and you can visit both with the same ticket. It's a place where you can come closer to all the races throughout the Chinese territory from Muslims to Hindu and from the Korean minority to people living",
          "It's the absolute way of an overview and a virtual visit in the whole China's history and monuments! Hundreds of Chinese monuments in miniatures, from the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, up to the Summer Palace and to less known monuments. Constructed in the highest level of",
          "It is nice to visit here...but need english translation. Many staffs do not speak english make tourists difficult to understand what message they speak during show. It is recommended place to be visit in shen zhen.",
          "I really had my hopes high when i got there, i thought \"hi, this is a great way to get to know chinese tradition and history\". in fact it was boring, hot, long, and boring... go elsewhere. sorry for the bad review, i simply didn't like it.",
          "I love Chinese culture and history. So that was why I visited this place. Beautiful and gave me chance to see and learnt about Chinese folk culture.",
          "Splendid China really helped me to see China in mini version. This place similar to Madurodam in Netherland, but because we were in China and I love chinese history so I did not want to miss any chance to visit this place. So, whenever you are in Shenzhen, do not miss Splendid",
          "Its a nice place to spend a full day in culture of china. The dance shows were nice to watch, variety of shows there. Indoor cultural show at 5pm not to be missed.",
          "The two parks are combined for an entrance fee of 180 yuan. The park is huge and there is a lot of ground to cover but environment is very serene. The food is not so great and quite overpriced. You're better off packing a picnic and enjoying your meal in a quiet part of the park.",
          "Splendid China provides an overview of the historic sites of China in miniature. You can either walk the park, 1-2 hours, or rent a small scooter. They also have a variety of venues showcasing Chinese culture. The food court is small but offers a good selection.",
          "Really gives an insight into china and it's history. Superb model recreations. One of the the most beautiful places I have been",
          "Liked this place a lot. If you want to learn chinese culture in one day this is a nice way of doing it. Take comfortable shoes.",
          "Splendid China consists of Folk Culture Village and Miniature Park. One can either explore Splendid China by foot or take tram ride to see both areas. One can also rent a single seat or a double-seat scooter to see Splendid China. What I liked most was the wonderful evening",
          "all the major architecture and tourist attractions of China are miniaturised in this theme park. It's great if you are visiting China for the first time and just want a quick taste. or use it as an introductory visit",
          "We met up with some friends to spend the day there but the weather was very hot.Great sightseeing as I would say its a must see attraction.",
          "such amazing park with beautiful miniatures around the world its good to be there on the spring season",
          "A constructed village putting on a display that is carefully planned. The show theatre had tiny seats making an hour there uncomfortable.",
          "Splendid China and China Folk Culture Village is a theme park that lies close to Window of the World. Splendid China has miniature replicas of some of China\u2019s best known landmarks, like the Great Wall of China and the Summer Palace. Most attractions are in the scale of 1:15.",
          "China has decided to embrace it's different cultures within its borders and give it a theme park like experience. There are a few things for younger kids to burn off a bit of energy. A few events did not have English translation available:-( but lots of credit for having it",
          "Although it requires particular interest in some Chinese history and iconic places, but still nice place but not for the whole day. You can combine any other place with it .... may be Window of the world",
          "A very well done theme park, China Folk Culture Village give you a bird's eye view of the many monument scattered around China. Also know locally as Splendid China, it is a quick walk from the Windows of the World metro station. I went with my parents and was surprised that even",
          "There are interesting attraction here. Visitors can enjoy Miniature World Heritage of China and Riding horses show. Here is good place to enjoy holiday with Family.",
          "Almost need a full day to see everything. I would recommend seeing the miniature replicas of China first as there was no lighting in that area and we ran out of time to see that after spending so long in the folk villages with all the interesting exhibits and friendly people.",
          "It has all the attractions everywhere in China located in one place. You can visit the Great Wall, the Potala Palace, the Forbidden City, the Sun Yat Sen Memorial, and the original Three Gorges (before it's flooded by the dam). For a quick review of all the important sites in",
          "I like to look around in this area. Give me so many insights of China culture either the dancing or the panorama of Chinese landscape.",
          "I went there on January 2015. It was a big area which consists various attraction such as dance and theatrical culture, there is also a miniature of many iconic places in China. If you too tired, to look around the area by walk, you can take a car to go around.",
          "This place is demonstration old Chinese culture. Small models of old buildings & locations like Great Wall. Can see some street dramas as well.Laser shows at evenings as well. Chinese old music was interesting.This place was nicely maintained by the management. But this is not",
          "There are 56 nationalities in China, so you will see a lot of them in their customary outfits. You stay all day all night in this place to watch some traditional singing and dancing.. and fireworks at night.",
          "If you don't have time to visit the whole China, this is the place to be. Shenzhen is a young city, they built this to attract tourists. But we always enjoyed our visit to this place.",
          "It was part of the program while attending a medical conference. The light n dance show was pretty good, but short of impressive. Expected a Face Change act, but didn't happen. It's mostly Chinese traditional dance with a whiff of post modern contemporary attempt, while",
          "We were lucky enough to visit with a local guide, but a great time learning about the culture. If you don't speak Chinese a translator well be required but what a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.",
          "I found that it's a nice place to visit with your family. It's very commercialized though. Do not rent the electric car because you can use it on most roads inside.",
          "OMG what a cute place! it's like mini china and you get to see it all in once day. come prepared with water bottles and a good pair of shoes, dont come on a hot day or a rainy day you'll just hate it. also, it's costly",
          "Negative: - These 2 parks are combined, so ticket prices include both (though there's no real separation in the building layout). It was pricey - almost $30 per ticket. - My suggestion - do NOT go when it is hot (we had whiny kids, thirsty kids, hot kids, tired kids...). Due to",
          "Very nice park. Need some time to spend on this park. So many nice places to see. Very nice to see the historical culture.",
          "I was lucky enough to be taken to the Splendid China Park. The work that has gone making of ancient Chinese cities models. Not sure exactly how many models there are. I would have liked another day there. The Great Wall of China was the most fascinating to me. Some of the",
          "Very friendly people. Multi-generational activities. We had a wonderful time! I want to go back this next time.",
          "After 10years I came back to this park. Authentic as it is, lots of miniature of the famous places all over china, Forbidden City, Shi Shan Ling, Great wall, and my most favourite part is the chinese folk culture show which shows every day at 7.30pm",
          "It's good place for children. It constrain interesting views and models. It was not crossed on Saturday. Also this place opens at 9 30 am.",
          "If you want a one day tour of the Whole of China this is the place to visit. A lot of walking to do but the shows are a must watch. Sovenior shopping inside is also relatively cheap.",
          "small little thing. but cute. not many things to do in SZ so this is one of the few things in the city so it's worth your while if you have a few days here",
          "We went there without any preparation but we were not disappointed. The weather was good and we had a enjoyable walk tough the park. The whole build-up with mini buildings was very nice to watch. I would go there again if I come by Shenzhen again.",
          "I don't feel the reviews online gave enough hard info, so I am hoping to help others after spending an afternoon at this site. First, the Folk Village and Splendid China are two parks that have been merged into one. It's 180 RMB entrance fee for foreigners to get into both",
          "This one is worth visiting, it's not too over the top and it's a mixture of relaxing things to see and escapism, you can go off and explore on your own to find things of interest.",
          "Cute, but overall disappointing. If you want to see a collection of the other things you should be seeing in China, this is the place for you. Shenzhen really has very little history of its own, so they've tried to co-opt other parts of China for this park.",
          "I enjoyed the shows, very clean and nice place to visit and kill time. I'd stay away from the street food offered there, though",
          "A 'theme park' but with very little buz. To be fair we visited Spendid China in Florida which is steets ahead. This park is co-located with the Folk Village and on my visit attracted about 10% of the visitors walking about as the Folk Village. Maybe for those who have not 'done'",
          "This is a 'theme park' that is designed to celebrate the many minorities in china. To sum up there is the Han and the rest are minorities. Language, customs, dress, music it's all there. Do not treat as authentic more as illustration/information gathering but worthwhile.",
          "Quite large park where people can get an overview of China. Animations, food stands, small shops, everything is available inside. A good way to spend an afternoon for example",
          "Ok, went here with a sales person I deal with in Shenzhen. What a surprise, I was expecting the usual Chinese glitz.....but this place was just an oasis, absolutely beautiful and more than worth the visit",
          "The China Cultural village is China in a park. It contains all of the highlights of China in a \"mini-town\" kind of way. The park is massive and quite exhausting.",
          "It is a beautiful place; but visit if you know already about Chinese culture and history; because there is not acceptable English guidance about background of you are seeing.",
          "Interesting for foreigners like me. It's a good opportunity to see different places of China in one single place",
          "One ticket gets you into both Splendid China and Chinese Folk Culture Village. I spent almost an entire day admiring the miniature replicas of Chinese attractions and learning the historical culture of China. Although miniature in size, the replicas are detailed and appears to",
          "Visited there in NOVEMBER 2012, the temperature at the end of NOVEMBER IS EVEN WARMER THAN THAT IN MOSCOW IN AUGUST! Because it's NOT as hot as I anticipated, I therefore enjoyed touring here! Many amusement theme games are here; from ferris wheels, to bumper cars! All are there",
          "Many good performance from china folk-culture, including Tibet, Mongol and many other traditional culture. I recommend to use train to travel from 1 location to another, because this park is so big and spread. Must see when in Shenzhen !",

          "It was very interesting to see all the different traditional cultures of China but it was not cheap and it was a little touristy/tacky sometimes... The park is massive so make sure you take breaks and have comfy shoes on",
          "This was an interesting place to visit. I am living in China at present and don't get to travel about much, so i really learned some greoast stuff about this country and its peoples. Could have spent many hours watching the shows and displays and going from place to place but it",
          "At first,I thought there's nothing to see and visit in this place but when we get to Folk Culture Village it was really a nice place,you can feel the tradition and the culture of Chinese people, they also have a cultural show. And they also a lot of jewelry shops like pearl,",
          "I visited this place on the recommendation of a friend and got some amazing photos. There is plenty to do here from regular shows to boat trips. I also found the area to be very peaceful. This is a place I would certainly like to visit again when I come back to China!",
          "not enough washrooms around , on very hot days there should be more water availability all over . the photo ops are amazing , the park is kept in excellent clean condition, pretty much everywhere, good value for money",
          "This is an interesting look at some of the minorities in China there are full size models of their buildings and people dressed in traditional clothing not certain if these folks are from each minority group.",
          "wow! wow! wow! One visit of hrer you needn't go all over China, I took photos with quite a few well-dressed ladies of all tribes and they are always have a smilling face, wonderful.",

          "We spent a couple of days there, mostly in the miniatures area. I still didn't really grasp all of it. It is, of course, a propagandistic presentation of the splendor of China's historical buildings, scenic sites, and ethnic building styles. And they consider Tibet and Taiwan to",
          "If you are really interested to know more about the Chinese culture and people then this is a must see / visit! As the name implies - its all about China and her people and buildings and structure. There are sections that will show the lifestyle of the various types of people",
          "This is a place we take anyone visiting us. It has two sections. Half of the attraction has cultural village settings of the various minority groups and the other half has miniatures of different parts of China. There are mini-shows of 5-20 minutes through out the day put on by",

          "the shows are awesome.may be you plan after noon so the best show timing are at 6 or 7 pm. carry your picnic set so you will have more time to explore every corner of the park",
          "China park is green and just what you would expect from a China Park. Little and large ornaments with man made lakes to sit by and rest",
          "On a business trip to Southern China, we were taken by our hosts on a tour of this amazing park. It really is wonderful and provides a fantastic overview of Chinese culture and history. If you're on a short trip to Shenzen, this is well worth checking out",
          "We spent several hours here and I was pretty bored. Its kind of like the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu but not as polished and the people didn't speak much or any English so you couldn't talk to the people from the different villages. It was pretty empty when we were",
          "I lived in Shenzhen for several years. During that time I took visitors to many of the attractions in the city. This time I took my daughter to Spendid China. Most of our time was spent on the 'miniatures' side of the park before attending the costume show complete with",
          "We visited here as a group and hired buggies to get around. I would recommend the buggies if you struggle walking as there is a lot of walking to do (the hire is not that cheap). The grounds are well maintained and as promised it had lots of miniatures such as the Great Wall.",
          "The heat and heavy crowds over New Years break week were just too much for me, so I decided not to go in the village on the day I got there. I did, however, enjoy people watching around the beautiful entrance to the park and took pictures. There is a monorail and overpass at",
          "It's really good place for you to understand and traveling the whole china within 1 day. it's a miniature of China. but they put it good presentation.",
          "Attached to Spendid China, the combination of China Folk Culture Village and Splendid China is a wonderful experience for locals and visitors. You will get a comprehensive view and experience of what the different areas and historical periods have looked like at the Culture",
          "Spendid China is a beautiful park with what seems like miles of paths. It is connected to the China Folk Culture Village so I recommend spending a full day between the 2 park. Splendid China is a history lesson like nowhere else with history lessons / information for all the",
          "If you love to explore different cultures & ethnic of Chinese people, this is the place to go. They have very beautiful different & colourful costumes that you can't help but feel in awe when you watch the show.",
          "The place is rather big and you really need a lot of time to move from one scaled model to another. Besides you can take a ride in their buggy and get off where you want to. Lush greenery. Nice place to while away the time.",
          "Splendid China and China Folk Village are combined, so one ticket gives you access to both. They are a good combination with splendid China being a miniature depiction of the styles of architecture and natural scenery of China. The miniature wall is very good....not so",
          "Visited the place with family for a day and I'm sadly to say the place is quite not deserve the ticket price(180RMB). The whole area is big and had various famous architecture in mini size. However, the statues were not protected well and the whole environment was not maintained",
          "It was very good quality for China! Lots to see and do, and open areas to wander about. There were some great models of places that really are spectacular in China - its a great advert for the country. There were small shows and a cinema show we saw. You have to be on the ball a",
          "Nearly a full day was spent at this attraction and well worth it. We learnt much and saw lots. The final stage show was magnificent.",
          "Plan for a whole day of walking and sight seeing sized to scale replicas of China's beautiful landscapes, cultures, landmarks, and wonders. Watch some of the cultural shows. The horse show is my favorite.",
          "conviniently located and can finish off in spare time in the evenings, gives a good insight of chinese culture",
          "I am a bit biased, as my apartment looked over the park and I was able to enjoy an immaculately curated garden simply by sitting on my balcony or sofa. We were very amused to be able to see a scaled view of the \"little Great Wall of China\", and would often go into the park to",
          "The Dancing concert was really amazing. Very colorful and attractive. If you are a visitor you will get to know about the history of china. How it was built with the live war simulations. Spend the whole day. Value for your money",
          "It's a huger Park, with many greens and tress with a wonderful design. But the Main Attraction are the different 'villages' from every tribe in China. They offers different shows. With 180 rmb, I think its a little overpriced (Kids 90) under 150 cm free, but still I liked it.",
          "It's a great way of getting to know the Asian culture and traditions. Do not miss, the events they organize on Sundays, such as horse riding and archery demonstrations.",
          "A well done park with many replicas of old Chinese civilizations. There is plenty of items to read in English to understand each exhibit. There is a show with horses during day with many ancient dancing shows as well. Well worth the money of admittance.",
          "you will see a lot of Chinese cultural there, very plural. and there's a magnificent Chinese folk show at 7 pm, don't miss it!",
          "The village is a large open space with so much to offer about the different culture within China. The beautifully made replicas of old houses, bridges, rivers, parks, monasteries etc gives you a better understanding of the country and it's people. Lush green with well preserved",
          "I spent about 7 hours in the park. The ticket price is not really cheap, but the park is amazing! there is an extra fee for internal shuttle that goes over the 2 sections of the park in 25 mins. You can get in and out of the golf car when you want. I used the car 3 times, park",
          "We were given wrong information on which metro station to exit. By the time we got to the park it was about 3 hours to closing. The only show we were able to get to was really interesting and worth going to even if it was all in Mandarin. The park is a little dirty and",
          "This place is amazing, it has mini Tinanmen square and good photo opportunites. We had the street food of China, street vendors were walking around and reminding of the old ways. Local shows and performance were amzing in the open air seating.",
          "Fast service, good managing of schedules concern as well as predicting items of dishes. There are only Chinese food",
          "I saw their evening show for Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year). It was spectacular. Lots of dancers and the costumes and props were magnificent. I loved the story line and I was highly entertained. The amount of dancers and live animals was breath taking! The only disappointment",
          "My husband and I visited Splendid China during the Chinese New Year. The park is divided into two sections. One has life-size replicas of different places around China. The other side has miniatures. There were plenty of shops and shows in between for a small fee but well",
          "The replicas blew me away. The Great Wall and Imperial Palace especially but so much of the replicas were amazing. It just makes me want to come back and see more of China outside of the Golden Triangle. The replicas themselves would have been enough but the ethnic village",
          "We went during the International Women's day and I got my entrance tickets at half price (original price is rmb180 per person). The huge park could be divided into three parts: the mini China sceneries, the cultural experience China street, and the China tribal minorities",
          "This is a great place to teach international elementary students about Chinese culture and the diversity in its population. Some great performance of the different minority groups from all over China. Our student especially enjoyed the performances that were interactive. Easily",
          "Our chinese hosts took us there - it was either that or Window of the World, and apart from the peculiar aspects of some of the miniature models of the clay warriers or Mongolia, it was actually a very nice 4 hours spent. Some of the exhibitions and gardens were nicely done.",
          "A lot of things to see and to learn, a must go! Near the window of the world, which is also a must see. A very satisfying day trip!",
          "This was a seriously under rated venue. By far the high light of my visit to Shenzhen and is a whole day event. Both educational and fun whit so much to do and see all for a mere 180rmb but really worth every penny. Miniature china and amusements to delight all the family.",
          "It\u00b4s a park with miniatures, but it is dirty and ruined down. Don\u00b4t go to the restrooms, are nasty, the dirtiest I\u00b4ve ever been to.",
          "This is an amazing tourist park with replicas of much of different parts and times in China. Much of it is interactive and would appeal to people of all ages. The map was in English too and at each exhibit, an explanation was written and narrated in both Chinese and English. It",
          "Liked the relaxing atmosphere. Weekdays are good, weekends can be crowded. Good food stalls and restaurants. Communications are fine",
          "The Park is filled with many minature replicas of places and and attractions you have on your bucket list. Anghor Wat, Wiffel Tower, Taj Mahal, Imperial Palace in Seoul; Mt. Rushmore, New York City, Washington DC; etc.",
          "I especially liked the shows that this little place has to offer. The noodles of one of the restaurants were also great!",
          "This park is awsome spent your time here watching the shows in every village, the scenary is great, the stages are well done, the artist are amazing. The 3 big stage shows are very professional, the horse show is fun and entertaining, the costume show is beautiful and visually",
          "You pay 180RMB for two parks Splendid China and Folk Villages, the second one worth the price, don't waste you time in Splendid China just go around for 1 hour, it is like a public park with minitures but all the lakes are dry and dirty, some of the minatures are closed and the",
          "about Chinese culture and there are several attractions but charge .. attractions taking place at specific time ... a lot of interesting things that you will find here ... do not forget to empty your camera memory card...you will spent time here about 4-5 hours..",
          "you can learn about china culture in this park...china culture of various tribes presented complete in the form of miniatures ... use sandals or shoes that are comfortable while visiting the park because it is quite broad but do not worry you can hire \"bugy\" if you don't want",
          "a very nice park in which you can learn a lot from Chinese culture and see miniatures of the most important and popular Chinese monuments",
          "We went to Hong kong and decided to visit Shenzhen as well. we took the train from Lo Wu to Huaqiaocheng Station. A short walk less than 5 minutes takes to reach Spendid China. The admission ticket is RMB 180 per person and I find it quite expensive. I reached the place around",
          "Went here on a day trip to Shenzhen and spent the morning at this attraction, I was sceptical that it would be worth a visit but was won over by the quality of the theme park and the exhibits and demonstrations, allow several hours.",
          "We visited the village at night, so it was almost closing time, but we were impressed with the lighting and the romantic atmosphere. Highly recommended to visit.",
          "One of the best theme parks to visit and do not visit the two shows that take place each evening. The shows were truly mesmerizing and entertaining, not to be missed.",
          "Fantastic gardens and water features with scale miniature models of famous Chinese historical landmarks. There are also life sized traditional homes from different parts of China, a traditional Chinese village, and a stage with a live traditional Chinese play. Nice restaurant is",
          "Its a lot of little models of different places around China, which is interesting to see if you've not gone around China. I prefer this to windows of the world which is the same but landmarks around the world, as you get to see places around China. Best to try and go on a",
          "The entrance fees to China Folk Culture Village is RMB180. We went in Dec, happened to be a cold, windy and rainy day. It is not crowded. The landscape was commendable, with the beautiful flowers and miniature replicas of the interesting and historical places in China, You",
          "Very interesting for tourists who like to see ethnic China. Most of them only know the Han Chinese, here you meet Li, Wu, Miao, Mogol, a.s.o. The shows are wonderful, beautiful dancers in colorful dresses, performance unique,",
          "180 yuan each I thought was a bit rich but we enjoyed the experience. Lots of walking which we enjoyed so we can get back to the Hotel & eat more Duck. Horse show was interesting but don't expect any English translation. We took taxi each way & cost 50 each way from Central",
          "Get off at the Overseas China Town (OCT) stop on the metro and take a right out of the station and make your way through the parklands area and over the pedestrian bridge. Once you've entered the park you're basically left to your own devices. I consider myself pretty fit and I",
          "This place sounds terribly kitschy but actually it was quite pleasant. The miniatures are pretty big and are a great way to decide where you want to travel in China. The ethnic minority homes are much more kitschy but still somewhat interesting and the Mongolian horse show is",
          "Very much alike with Window of the World, China Folk Culture Village has a huge collection of Chinese landmarks in smaller size, with its distinctive architecture and plantation arrangement. Performance show is also interesting, but for me it was more like \"formality thing to",
          "Good to understand the different cultural from China and the performance show is worth to see and enjoy.",
          "We enjoyed a day of entertainment, recognizing that, in reality, the PRC's minority populations aren't always happy and dancing. The quality of the presentations of folkloric music, dance and games was highly professional. The portion of the park with the miniatures of the",
          "We had a great time at this place. It's like visiting the whole China in one day! I suggest not to go when raining",
          "interesting model villages to show the diversity of traditional architecture in the villages around China, set in acres of gardens that are pleasant to walk around and spend a few hours relaxing. I was surprised how interesting it actually was, although the usual souvenir shops",
          "Quite crowded and a bit disappointing particularly if you have visited the actual sites around China depicted here in miniature. Pretty unremarkable overall.",
          "This attraction is a really good to way to experience the Chinese vision of its own history. the shows and interactive performances are great fun. The highlight would have to be the dance show, fantastic",
          "This place was the highlight of my visit to Shenzhen. Some people might say it's too commercial replica of the villages in interior China but it is great concept of many things under one roof as it would take huge efforts to traverse China to see the authentic villages. The",
          "It's something diff. You get to see the diff cultures in china. They do live shows. The Chinese are very welcoming and very entertaining people. They know how yo put on a show. So deff make a stop there",
          "This park has reconstructed habitat of many Chinese ethnic minorities, with people in traditional clothing and sometimes dance and music show. It is really good in general to discover the variety of ethnicities in China and very good for children.",

          "Splendid China Park its really complete park i ever been. the tourist information really completed even the staff not really speaks English but i appreciated that the staff really try hard to give an information. Its not really difficult to find and really nice place to hang",
          "Actually the park was quite new when we visited the Splendid China Park. Love the very cultural side of the place. We were very lucky to re-entered the park for the evening performance. The horse warriors show was thrilling. The evening show showed super skills of all involved.",
          "This theme park gave us an overall impression of the regions, people and style of housing in every part of China. A great place to visit if you are short on time.",
          "A good place to visit to see China in a day. Highly recommended for people who would like to learn more about the China and it's culture.",
          "France miniature in France, Minimundus in Austria. Very nice place in a clean and big parc. Tube is just in front of the entrance. Most chineese places in small size but also some in real size. Gives an idea on how it looks and how is made. Shows are good, only point is the",
          "A fabulous theme park bringing China at its great diversity and beauty to one location. Don't miss the spectacular evening show, Vegas style",
          "This was included in our private tour with China Tour Advisors, and an odd stop in our itinerary, but we went along with it anyways. It was way hot and humid even for October, so we opted to go during the late afternoon for a few hours and checked out the Mongolian Horse Show",
          "Shenzhen is a city on the Mainland bordering Hong Kong that is best known for shopping. Best known for shopping of imitation branded products and electronics, it is also a major commercial hub. It also has a popular theme park \u2013 Window Of The World, which showcases scaled down",
          "Little has changed from my last visits some 12 years ago. Its an interesting tour through the many Chinese nationalities. I found the evening show really fun but my companion thought it was a bit cheesey. Prices were a lot higher then my last visit, not helped by the currency",
          "I last visited this attraction some 12 years ago. It was average then and to be frank it really hasn't changed very much. But if you are in shenzhen with time to kill then you could drop worse then this. The price in my opinion is rather high",
          "This is an amazing place to understand about the depth of the cultural heritage in China. The people grup displays are highly detailed, and the cusume show was truly amazing. A must see.",
          "Splendid China is aptly named... it is the right adjective used to describe a theme park that offers so much more than one can take in on a day out. The evening show/performance (7.30 pm) by itself would already be worth the price (180 Yuan) one pays to enter Splendid China.",
          "they have different variety of activities and shows in different sctions, but the night show at the main stage is the best one, even local people like very much.",

          "Although I wasn't able to get to all the historic sites during my visit, this park is the next best thing. It contains scaled-down versions of all the different sites in China, and gives you the feeling that you're exploring the whole country in a single afternoon. I was",
          "I went here with my best buddies and we completely enjoyed the trip. It was an eye opener to see many miniature structures and understand the culture. Best part was the dance show .We watched 2 of them and it was great fun ! Especially one of the shows where we were taken inside",
          "If you like to feel the environment of traditional China, this is the right place. You would find everything that traditional Chinese people may build: Traditional houses, traditional handcrafts, traditional dances, and even replica of landmarks; all of them are there at once.",
          "If you have no time to visit different parts of China then go to Splendid China and the Cultural Villages. Half of the theme park is a miniature of all the main/ tourist/famous/historical parts of China. The other half has representative village houses from the minority groups",
          "We went during the day. It was really hot and humid so that affected enjoyment... well for me anyway. It would have been much better with more shows. There are some nice historical pieces and homes.",
          "Do not think that you will get around this park very quick. You will need a good day to see the lot and then you will have to skimp on some of it as there is so much to see. Park is divided into sections with a different theme in each. Wonderfully set out with plenty of flat",
          "Splendid China is the best theme park ever devised by man! The miniatures were amazing and everything was put in the greatest of settings. It was huge so it took me many hours to explore it all. The memory card for my camera is now full. Gotta buy a new one. I rate this place 11",

          "The Folk Culture Village is now part of the Cultural China Park. It is between Window of the World and Cultural China. It is an interesting walk through if you plan on visiting the other park. Peacocks can be seen walking around the village. It is a secondary attraction that",
          "Splendid China is a combination garden and cultural exhibit. The meandering walkways pass by beautiful beds of plantings and detailed miniatures of famous historical places in China. Relax and enjoy!",

        "wiki": "Once common throughout China, walled villages can still be found in southern China and Hong Kong. Most of the walled villages of Hong Kong are located in the New Territories.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Ming and Qing dynasties, the shore of Guangdong suffered from pirates, and the area of Hong Kong was particularly vulnerable to pirates' attacks. Winding shores, hilly lands and islands and far from administrative centres made Hong Kong an excellent hideout for pirates. Villages, both Punti and Hakka, built walls against them. Some villages even protected themselves with cannons.\nOver time, the walls of most walled villages have been partly or totally demolished.\n\n\n== Names ==\nIn Punti Cantonese, Wai (\u570d, Walled) and Tsuen (\u6751, Village) were once synonyms, hence most place names which include the word 'wai', were at some point in time a walled village.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nTwo heritage trails of Hong Kong feature walled villages:\n\nPing Shan Heritage Trail. One walled village: Sheung Cheung Wai (\u4e0a\u748b\u570d).\nLung Yeuk Tau Heritage Trail. Five walled villages: Lo Wai (\u8001\u570d), Ma Wat Wai (\u9ebb\u7b0f\u570d), San Wai (\u65b0\u570d, also called Kun Lung Wai \u89b2\u9f8d\u570d), Tung Kok Wai (\u6771\u95a3\u570d, also known as Ling Kok Wai), Wing Ning Wai (\u6c38\u5be7\u570d).\n\n\n== Features ==\nWalled villages in Hong Kong are characterised by row houses arranged in a square or rectangular block, where the parallel rows of houses are separated by narrow lanes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable walled villages ==\n\n\n=== Kat Hing Wai ===\n\nKat Hing Wai (\u5409\u6176\u570d) is a noted Punti walled village in Yuen Long District of Hong Kong. It often mistakenly believed to be Hakka, whose people have similar traditions. However the Punti people were from Southern China and the first to settle in Hong Kong. Kat Hing Wai's residents speak Cantonese, rather than Hakka. Popularly known as Kam Tin, from the name of the area, it is home to about 400 descendants of the Tang Clan, who built the village back in the 17th century.\nKat Hing Wai is a rectangular (100 m x 90 m) walled village. As a family stronghold, Kat Hing Wai has served the Tangs well through the centuries, protecting the residents against bandits, rival clans, and wild tigers. In the Qing Dynasty, a five-metre high blue brick wall and four cannon towers were added to defend against bandits. Today, the village is still completely surrounded by 18-inch-thick walls, outside which are the remains of a moat. However, most houses within the walls have been rebuilt in recent years.  There is only one narrow entrance, with a pair of iron gates.\n\n\n=== Tsang Tai Uk ===\n\nTsang Tai Uk (\u66fe\u5927\u5c4b), also known as Shan Ha Wai, is another well-known Hakka walled village in Hong Kong, and one of the best preserved. It is located in Sha Tin, close to the south of the Pok Hong Estate, not far from the Lion Rock Tunnel Road. Built as a stronghold for the Tsang Clan, its construction started in 1847 and took around 20 years to complete. The village is built with granite, grey bricks and solid timber.\n\n\n=== Sheung Shui Wai ===\n\nSheung Shui Wai (\u4e0a\u6c34\u570d), also known as Sheung Shui Heung (\u4e0a\u6c34\u9109), is one of the very few rural settlements having retained its original moat which was built in 1646. Characterized by its magnificent moat and landscape setting, the walled village is the core of the Liu clan, of which ancestors came originally from Fujian during the Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368). The village is located in Sheung Shui.\n\n\n=== Fanling Wai ===\n\nFanling Wai (\u7c89\u5dba\u570d) is a walled village in Fanling built by the Pang (\u5f6d) Clan. It is recognisable with the distinctive pond and layout including features such as cannons and watchtowers. All these elements were crafted to form an integral part of the village setting. Fanling Wai is the centre of the Pang Clan who arrived in Hong Kong late in the Song Dynasty.\n\n\n=== Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen ===\n\nNga Tsin Wai Tsuen (\u8859\u524d\u570d\u6751) is a walled village in Wong Tai Sin, New Kowloon. It is the only walled village left in the urban built-up areas of Hong Kong. Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen is also the only remaining walled village in Kowloon. It is located near San Po Kong. On 18 July 2007, the government announced its plans to redevelop Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen.\n\n\n== List of walled villages ==\nRemaining walled villages in Hong Kong include:\n\n\n=== North District ===\n\n\n=== Sha Tin District ===\n\n\n=== Tai Po District ===\n\n\n=== Tsuen Wan District ===\n\n\n=== Tuen Mun District ===\n\n\n=== Wong Tai Sin District ===\n\n\n=== Yuen Long District ===\n\n\n== Unconfirmed ==\nThe following villages are likely to have been walled villages, although it is not confirmed:\n\n\n== Other fenced villages ==\nA number of old villages in Hong Kong have a wall, built for defensive or feng shui purposes, and an entrance gate, but are not considered as traditional walled villages. They include:\n\n\n== Non-walled 'wai' ==\nThe following villages are neither current nor former walled villages, despite the wai in their name:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHousing in Hong Kong\nHistory of Hong Kong\nList of villages in Hong Kong\nChinese clan\nWeitou dialect\nDapengcheng, a walled village in Shenzhen\nHakka walled village\nKowloon Walled City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIp, Hing-fong (1995).

        "wiki": "Mai Po Marshes (Chinese: \u7c73\u57d4\u6fd5\u5730; Hong Kong Hakka: Mi3bu4 Sip5ti4) is a nature reserve located in San Tin near Yuen Long in Hong Kong.  It is part of Deep Bay, an internationally significant wetland that is actually a shallow estuary, at the mouths of Sham Chun River, Shan Pui River (Yuen Long Creek) and Tin Shui Wai Nullah. Inner Deep Bay is listed as a Ramsar site under Ramsar Convention in 1995, and supports globally important numbers of wetland birds, which chiefly arrive in winter and during spring and autumn migrations. The education center and natural conservation area is 380 acres (1.5 km2) wide and its surrounding wetland has an area of 1500 acres (6 km2). It provides a conservation area for mammals, reptiles, insects, and over 350 species of birds.\nThe reserve is managed by the World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong since 1983 and WWF runs professionally guided visits for the public and schools to the reserve ; the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has responsibilities for the Ramsar site as a whole. Deep Bay faces threats, including pollution, and rising mudflat levels that perhaps arise from intense urbanization, especially (in recent years) on the north, Shenzhen side of the bay.\nIn recent years, it housed over 55,000 migrating birds, including Saunders's gull (Chroicocephalus saundersi) and a quarter of the world's black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor) population. It also has inter-tidal mangroves along with 24 traditionally operated shrimp ponds (called Gei Wai locally) to provide food for the birds. Mai Po Marshes receives some 32,000 visitors annually. This April 2020 a pair of spoonbill sandpiper have been spotted at the reserve. \nWhile the area was taken out of the Frontier Closed Area on 15 February 2012, Mai Po Nature Reserve remains a restricted area under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Chapter 170) in order to minimize disturbance to wildlife. \nVisitors need a 'Mai Po Marshes Entry Permit' to enter the Reserve. \nBy joining a WWF professionally guided activity you can book online wwf.org.hk/en and be part of a small group ecovisit and WWF will take care of permits for you.  ( From 16 March - small eco groups of 4 will ensure community health precautions to maintain safe , healthy access on your visit with WWF to the Reserve )   \nAs an individual you can apply for a permit by writing to the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department of Hong Kong Government. These Individual Permits normally take about four weeks to be processed.\nThe marshes are also have rich insect biodiversity, being the place the endemic Mai Po bent winged firefly (Pteroptyx maipo Ballantyne) was discovered. Not only was  the species new to science, but it was also the first time for the genus Pteroptyx has been recorded in China. To understand the seasonal population changes, distribution and habitat requirements of the species, WWF Hong Kong have been carrying out firefly surveys of the nature reserve. The surveys have also incorporated Citizen Science participation, and using this approach to further monitor the biodiversity, WWF have incorporated iNaturalist and the City Nature Challenge into activities at their Mai Po centre.\n\n\n== Avian flu outbreak ==\nIn February 2008, the Hong Kong government closed Mai Po for 21 days following the discovery of a great egret infected with H5N1, also known as avian flu.  The closing marked the fourth in as many years and was consistent with the government's policy of closing Mai Po whenever an infection is discovered within a 3 kilometer radius of the premises.  The World Wide Fund for Nature criticized the government, however, for what it called a discrepancy between the standards for closing Mai Po and the comparably less strict standards applied in urban areas.  The World Wide Fund for Nature wanted compensation of 1 million Hong Kong dollars. WWF then claimed that the government had not compensated it for lost income.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHong Kong Wetland Park\nNam Sang Wai\nFung Lok Wai\nEnvironment of Hong Kong\nList of buildings, sites and areas in Hong Kong\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLai, Lawrence W.C.; Lam, Ken K.H.; Lorne, F.T.; Wong, S.K.

        "wiki": "Nanjing (listen), alternatively romanized as Nanking and Nankin, is the capital of Jiangsu province of the People's Republic of China and the second largest city in the East China region, with 11 districts, an administrative area of 6,600 km2 (2,500 sq mi) and a total population of 8,505,500 as of 2019.Situated in the Yangtze River Delta region, Nanjing has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, having served as the capital of various Chinese dynasties, kingdoms and republican governments dating from the 3rd century to 1949, and has thus long been a major center of culture, education, research, politics, economy, transport networks and tourism, being the home to one of the world's largest inland ports. The city is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People's Republic of China's administrative structure, enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province. Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of \"Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength\" issued by the National Statistics Bureau, and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta. It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honor of China, Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honor Award and National Civilized City.Nanjing has many high-quality universities and research institutes, with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third, including Nanjing University which has a long history and is among the world top 10 universities ranked by Nature Index. The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide. Nanjing is one of the top three Chinese scientific research centers, according to the Nature Index, especially strong in the chemical sciences.\nNanjing, one of the nation's most important cities for over a thousand years, is recognized as one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China. It has been one of the world's largest cities, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of Eastern Wu (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the Three Kingdoms period; the Eastern Jin and each of the Southern dynasties (Liu Song, Southern Qi, Liang and Chen), which successively ruled southern China from 317\u2013589; the Southern Tang (937\u201375), one of the Ten Kingdoms; the Ming dynasty when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the Republic of China under the nationalist Kuomintang (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-Shek during the Chinese Civil War. The city also served as the seat of the rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1853\u201364) and the Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei (1940\u201345) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the Nanjing massacre.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the Presidential Palace and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as Fuzimiao, Ming Palace, Chaotian Palace, Porcelain Tower, Drum Tower, Stone City, City Wall, Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake and Purple Mountain. Key cultural facilities include Nanjing Library, Nanjing Museum and Nanjing Art Museum.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7), whose former character Jiang (\u6c5f, Yangtze) is the former part of the name Jiangsu and latter character Ning (\u5be7, simplified form \u5b81; 'Peace') is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the ROC, Jing (\u4eac; 'Capital') was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the Jin dynasty. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the Ming dynasty, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (\u91d1\u9675, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous Ginling College; the old name has been used since the Warring States period in the Zhou dynasty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and foundation ===\n\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during the reign of the First Emperor of Qin. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\n\n\n=== Capital of the Six Dynasties ===\n\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD 229, when the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period relocated its capital to Jianye (\u5efa\u696d), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD 211. Although conquered by the Western Jin dynasty in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the rebellions by eight Jin princes for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from Xiongnu and other nomadic peoples that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called Jiankang (\u5efa\u5eb7), replacing Luoyang. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to southern China.\n\nDuring the period of North\u2013South division, Nanjing remained the capital of the Southern dynasties for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4 million residents.A number of sculptural ensembles of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in Qixia and Jiangning District. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475\u2013518), a brother of Emperor Wu of Liang.Six Dynasties is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: Eastern Wu (222\u2013280), Eastern Jin dynasty (317\u2013420) and four southern dynasties (420\u2013589).\n\n\n=== Destruction and revival ===\n\nThe period of division ended when the Sui dynasty reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou (\u6607\u5dde) in the Tang dynasty and resuscitated during the late Tang.It was chosen as the capital and called Jinling (\u91d1\u9675) during the Southern Tang (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of Yang Wu. It was renamed Jiangning (\u6c5f\u5be7) in the Northern Song and renamed Jiankang in the Southern Song. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign invasions from the north by the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. The court of Da Chu, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.The Southern Song were eventually exterminated by the Mongols; during their rule as the Yuan dynasty, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\n\n\n=== Southern capital of Ming dynasty ===\n\nThe first emperor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (\u61c9\u5929), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a 48 km (30 mi) long city wall around Yingtian, as well as a new Ming Palace complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21 years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day City Wall of Nanjing was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving city walls in China. The Jianwen Emperor ruled from 1398 to 1402.\n\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the Ming treasure fleet for the city's defense.  Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the de facto capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding Xuande Emperor remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, Emperor Yingzong ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" (\u884c\u5728) on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Porcelain Tower, although the latter was destroyed by the Taipings in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its geomantic properties.A monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the Yangshan Quarry (located some 15\u201320 km (9\u201312 mi) east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic stele, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600 years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.As the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral Zheng He, who went to sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (\u6e24\u6ce5; B\u00f3n\u00ed), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The Tomb of the King of Boni, with a spirit way and a tortoise stele, was discovered in Yuhuatai District (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.Over two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebel forces and then to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince Zhu Yousong was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called Southern Ming dynasty.\n\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince Dodo approached Jiangnan the next spring. Days after Yangzhou fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the Manchu queue way. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the bannermen's cantonment, and occupied the former imperial Ming Palace, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that befell Yangzhou.Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion ===\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the Viceroy of Liangjiang. It was the site of a Qing Army garrison. It had been visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. Nanjing was threatened to be invaded by British troops during the close of the First Opium War, which was ended by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (\u5929\u4eac; '\"Heavenly Capital\" or \"Capital of Heaven\"'). The rebellion destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the Presidential Palace. When Qing forces led by Zeng Guofan retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.The New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the University of Nanking and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\n\n\n=== Capital of the republic and Nanking Massacre ===\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the founding of the Republic of China in January 1912 with Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked Yuan Shikai to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of Puyi, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the Kuomintang (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the Nanking decade. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and Sun Yat-sen's provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a grand mausoleum to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of Zhejiang and the general area had strong popular support for him.\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (\u9996\u90fd\u8a08\u5283), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the Empire of Japan started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War (often considered a theater of World War II). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. The total death toll, including estimates made by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city Chungking (Chongqing) and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"Nanjing Regime\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by Wang Jingwei was established in Nanjing as a rival to Chiang Kai-shek's government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the Surrender of Japan, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\n\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and People's Republic ===\n \nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangtze River. On April 23, the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (Guangzhou) until October 15, Chongqing until November 25, and then Chengdu before retreating to the island of Taiwan on December 10 where Taipei was proclaimed the temporary capital of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only Tibet and Hainan Island were left. \nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a province-level municipality, but it was soon merged into Jiangsu and again became the provincial capital by replacing Zhenjiang which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nNanjing, with a total land area of 6,598 km2 (2,548 sq mi), is situated in the heartland of the drainage area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is 650 km (400 mi) southeast of Luoyang, 900 km (560 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, 270 km (170 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, and 1,200 km (750 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The Yangtze River flows downstream from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the Huai River basin and the southern part is the Zhe River basin; they are connected by the Grand Canal east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai dominant in the northern part and Jiangzhe dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (\u4e1c\u5357, South East, the Southeast) and Jiangnan (\u6c5f\u5357, and River South, South of Yangtze).Nanjing borders Yangzhou to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); Zhenjiang to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and Changzhou to the southeast. On its western boundary is Anhui, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: Chuzhou to the northwest, Wuhu, Chaohu and Ma'anshan to the west and Xuancheng to the southwest.Nanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\n\n\n=== Climate and environment ===\n\nNanjing has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) and is influenced by the East Asian monsoon. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with Chongqing and Wuhan, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"Three Furnaces\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the plum blossom blooming season in which the meiyu (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Typhoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around 15.91 \u00b0C (60.6 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 2.7 \u00b0C (36.9 \u00b0F) in January to 28.1 \u00b0C (82.6 \u00b0F) in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221214.0 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 6 January 1955 to 40.7 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F) on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115 days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is 1,090 mm (43 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37 percent in March to 52 percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and sulfur reserves make up 40 percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of strontium rank first in East Asia and the South East Asia region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in Jiangning and Tangquan Hot Spring in Pukou.\n\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book The International Development of China (\u5efa\u570b\u65b9\u7565):Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. (\u5357\u4eac\u70ba\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u90fd\uff0c\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e43\u5728\u4e00\u7f8e\u5584\u4e4b\u5730\u5340\u3002\u5176\u5730\u6709\u9ad8\u5c71\uff0c\u6709\u6df1\u6c34\uff0c\u6709\u5e73\u539f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e09\u7a2e\u5929\u5de5\uff0c\u9418\u6bd3\u4e00\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u8aa0\u96e3\u8993\u5982\u6b64\u4f73\u5883\u4e5f\u3002\u800c\u53c8\u6070\u5c45\u9577\u6c5f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5169\u5cb8\u6700\u8c50\u5bcc\u5340\u57df\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5fc3...)To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 DWT vessels from the East China Sea.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\n\n==== Air pollution in 2013 ====\nA dense wave of smog began in the central and east parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 km (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00 pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the CPC, with the CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary as the de facto governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAt the time of the 2010 census, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005 million. The OECD estimated the encompassing metropolitan area at the time as 11.7 million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11 million. The birth rate was 8.86 percent and the death rate was 6.88 percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47 million people. The sex ratio of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.As in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other official ethnic groups. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Earlier development ===\n\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade (\u5357\u4eac\u4e91\u9526) is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as dragon robes. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\u8d21\u7f0e\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (\u7f51\u5dfe\u5e02, the market sells wangjin), Guyilang (\u4f30\u8863\u5eca, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (\u6cb9\u574a\u6865, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing Prosperous Nanjing (\u5357\u90fd\u7e41\u4f1a\u56fe\u5377; N\u00e1nd\u016b F\u00e1nhu\u00ec T\u00faju\u01cen) depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge department stores such as Zhongyang Shangchang sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the service industry, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of laid-off workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\n\n=== Today ===\n\nThe current economy of the city is basically newly developed based on the past. Service industries are dominating, accounting for about 60 percent of the GDP of the city, and financial industry, culture industry and tourism industry are top 3 of them. Industries of information technology, energy saving and environmental protection, new energy, smart power grid and intelligent equipment manufacturing have become pillar industries. Big civilian-run enterprise include Suning Commerce, Yurun, Sanpower, Fuzhong, Hiteker, 5stars, Jinpu, Tiandi, CTTQ Pharmaceutical, Nanjing Iron and Steel Company and Simcere Pharmaceutical. Big state-owned firms include Panda Electronics, Yangzi Petrochemical, Jinling Petrochemical, Nanjing Chemical, Jincheng Motors, Jinling Pharmaceutical, Chenguang and NARI. The city has also attracted foreign investment, multinational firms such as Siemens, Ericsson, Volkswagen, Iveco, A.O. Smith, and Sharp have established their lines, and a number of multinationals such as Ford, IBM, Lucent, Samsung and SAP established research center there. Many China-based leading firms such as Huawei, ZTE and Lenovo have key R&D institutes in the city. Nanjing is an industrial technology research and development hub, hosting many R&D centers and institutions, especially in areas of electronics technology, information technology, computer software, biotechnology and pharmaceutical technology and new material technology.\nIn recent years, Nanjing has been developing its economy, commerce, industry, as well as city construction. In 2013 the city's GDP was RMB 801 billion (3rd in Jiangsu), and GDP per capita (current price) was RMB 98,174(US$16041), an 11 percent increase from 2012. The average urban resident's disposable income was RMB 36,200, while the average rural resident's net income was RMB 14,513. The registered urban unemployment rate was 3.02 percent, lower than the national average (4.3 percent). Nanjing's Gross Domestic Product ranked 12th in 2013 in China, and its overall competence ranked 6th in mainland and 8th including Taiwan and Hong Kong in 2009.\nIndustrial zonesThere are a number of industrial zones in Nanjing.\n\nNanjing New and High-Tech Industry Development Zone\nNanjing Baixia Hi-Tech Industrial Zone\nNanjing Economic and Technological Development Zone\n\n\n== Transport ==\nNanjing is the transport hub in eastern China and the downstream Yangtze River area. Different means of transport constitute a three-dimensional transport system that includes land, water and air. As in most other Chinese cities, public transport is the dominant mode of travel for the majority of citizens. As from October 2014, Nanjing had four bridges and two tunnels over the Yangtze River, linking districts north of the river with the city center on the south bank.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nNanjing is an important railway hub in eastern China. It serves as rail junction for the Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) (which is itself composed of the old Jinpu and Huning Railways), Nanjing\u2013Tongling Railway (Ningtong), Nanjing\u2013Qidong (Ningqi), and the Nanjing-Xi'an (Ningxi) which encompasses the Hefei\u2013Nanjing Railway.\nNanjing is connected to the national high-speed railway network by Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway and Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu Passenger Dedicated Line, with several more high-speed rail lines under construction.\nAmong all 17 railway stations in Nanjing, passenger rail service is mainly provided by Nanjing Railway Station and Nanjing South Railway Station, while other stations like Nanjing West Railway Station, Zhonghuamen Railway Station and Xianlin Railway Station serve minor roles. Nanjing Railway Station was first built in 1968. On November 12, 1999, the station was burnt in a serious fire. Reconstruction of the station was finished on September 1, 2005. Nanjing South Railway Station, which is one of the 5 hub stations on Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, has officially been claimed as the largest railway station in Asia and the second largest in the world in terms of GFA (Gross Floor Area). Construction of Nanjing South Station began on 10 January 2008. The station was opened for public service in 2011.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nAs an important regional hub in the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is well-connected by over 60 state and provincial highways to all parts of China.\nMotorways such as Hu\u2013Ning, Ning\u2013He, Ning\u2013Hang enable commuters to travel to Shanghai, Hefei, Hangzhou, and other important cities quickly and conveniently. Inside the city of Nanjing, there are 230 km (140 mi) of highways, with a highway coverage density of 3.38 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (5.44 mi/100 sq mi). The total road coverage density of the city is 112.56 kilometers per hundred square kilometers (181.15 mi/100 sq mi). The two artery roads in Nanjing are Zhongshan Road and Hanzhong. The two roads cross in the city center, Xinjiekou.\nExpressways {G+XXxx (National Express, \u56fd\u5bb6\u9ad8\u901f), S+XX (\u7701\u7ea7\u9ad8\u901f)}:\n\nG25 Changchun\u2013Shenzhen Expressway\nG36 Nanjing\u2013Luoyang Expressway\nG40 Shanghai\u2013Xi'an Expressway\nG42 Shanghai\u2013Chengdu Expressway\nG4211 Nanjing\u2013Wuhu Expressway, a spur of G42 that extends west to Wuhu, Anhui\nS55 Nanjing\u2013Gaochun\uff08Xuancheng\uff09 Expressway (\u5b81\u5ba3\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u673a\u573a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS38 Yanjiang Expressway (\u6cbf\u6c5f\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5e38\u5408\u9ad8\u901f)\nG2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway (\u65b0\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u8d8a\u9ad8\u901f)\nS001 Nanjing Ring Highway (\u65e7\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u9ad8\u901f\u6216\u5357\u4eac\u7ed5\u57ce\u516c\u8def)National Highway {G1xx (which starts from Beijing), G2xx (north-south), G3xx (west-east)}:\n\nChina National Highway 104\u2014motorists can either drive northwest to Beijing or south to Fuzhou, Fujian.\nChina National Highway 205\u2014motorists can either drive north to Shanhaiguan, Hebei or south to Shenzhen, Guangdong.\nChina National Highway 312\u2014motorists can either drive east to Shanghai or west to Khorgas, Xinjiang on the Kazakh border\nChina National Highway 328\u2014Nanjing is the western terminus of G328, which motorists can follow to Hai'an County in eastern Jiangsu\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nThe city also boasts an efficient public transport network, which mainly consists of bus, taxi and metro systems. The bus network, which is currently run by three companies since 2011, provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas. At present, the Nanjing Metro system has a grand total of 377 km (234 mi) of route and 173 stations across 10 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 10, Line S1, Line S3, Line S7, Line S8 and Line S9. The city is planning to complete a 17-line Metro and light-rail system by 2030. The expansion of the Metro network will greatly facilitate intracity transport and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion.\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nNanjing's airport, Lukou International Airport, serves both national and international flights. In 2013, Nanjing airport handled 15,011,792 passengers and 255,788.6 tonnes of freight. The airport currently has 85 routes to national and international destinations, which include Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, United States and Germany. The airport is connected by a 29-kilometer (18 mi) highway directly to the city center, and is also linked to various intercity highways, making it accessible to the passengers from the surrounding cities. A railway Ninggao Intercity Line has been built to link the airport with Nanjing South Railway Station. Lukou Airport was opened on 28 June 1997, replacing Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport as the main airport serving Nanjing. Dajiaochang Airport is still used as a military air base. Nanjing has another airport \u2013 Nanjing Ma'an International Airport which temporarily serves as a dual-use military and civil airport.\n\n\n=== Water ===\nThe Port of Nanjing is the largest inland port in China, with annual cargo tonnage reached 191,970,000 t in 2012. The port area is 98 km (61 mi) in length and has 64 berths including 16 berths for ships with a tonnage of more than 10,000. Nanjing is also the biggest container port along the Yangtze River; in March 2004, the one million container-capacity base, Longtan Containers Port Area opened, further consolidating Nanjing as the leading port in the region. As of 2010, it operated six public ports and three industrial ports. The Yangtze River's 12.5-meter-deep waterway enables 50,000-ton-class ocean ships directly arrive at the Nanjing Port, and the ocean ships with the capacities of 100,000 tons or above can also reach the port after load reduction in the Yangtze River's high-tide period. CSC Jinling has a large shipyard.\n\n\n=== Yangtze River crossings ===\n\nIn the 1960s, the first Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and served as the only bridge crossing over the Lower Yangtze in eastern China at that time. The bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern China, having been built and designed by the Chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of Soviet expertise. Begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968, the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 meters on the upper deck, with approximately 1,580 meters spanning the river itself.  Since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built.  Going in the downstream direction, the Yangtze crossings in Nanjing are: Dashengguan Bridge, Line 10 Metro Tunnel, Third Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u957f\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053), First Bridge, Second Bridge and Fourth Bridge,Nanjing Yangtze Tunnel (\u5357\u4eac\u626c\u5b50\u6c5f\u96a7\u9053). In the near future, Such Yangtze Crossings will be added as follow :Jianning West Rd. Tunnel, Xianxin Rd. Tunnel, Heyan Rd. Tunnel, Fifth Nanjing Yangtze Bridge.\n\n\n== Culture and art ==\n\nBeing one of the four ancient capitals of China, Nanjing has always been a cultural center attracting intellectuals from all over the country. In the Tang and Song dynasties, Nanjing was a place where poets gathered and composed poems reminiscent of its luxurious past; during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the city was the official imperial examination center (Jiangnan Examination Hall) for the Jiangnan region, again acting as a hub where different thoughts and opinions converged and thrived.\nToday, with a long cultural tradition and strong support from local educational institutions, Nanjing is commonly viewed as a \"city of culture\" and one of the more pleasant cities to live in China.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nSome of the leading art groups of China are based in Nanjing; they include the Qianxian Dance Company, Nanjing Dance Company, Jiangsu Peking Opera Institute and Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Company among others.\nJiangsu Province Kun Opera is one of the best theaters for Kunqu, China's oldest stage art.\nIt is considered a conservative and traditional troupe. Nanjing also has professional opera troupes for the Yang, Yue (shaoxing), Xi and Jing (Chinese opera varieties) as well as Suzhou pingtan, spoken theater and puppet theater.\nJiangsu Art Gallery is the largest gallery in Jiangsu Province, presenting some of the best traditional and contemporary art pieces of China like the historical Master Ho-Kan; many other smaller-scale galleries, such as Red Chamber Art Garden and Jinling Stone Gallery, also have their own special exhibitions.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nMany traditional festivals and customs were observed in the old times, which included climbing the City Wall on January 16, bathing in Qing Xi on March 3, hill hiking on September 9 and others (the dates are in Chinese lunar calendar). Almost none of them, however, are still celebrated by modern Nanjingese.\nInstead, Nanjing, as a tourist destination, hosts a series of government-organized events throughout the year. The annual International Plum Blossom Festival held in Plum Blossom Hill, the largest plum collection in China, attracts thousands of tourists both domestically and internationally. Other events include Nanjing Baima Peach Blossom and Kite Festival, Jiangxin Zhou Fruit Festival and Linggu Temple Sweet Osmanthus Festival.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nNanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library. Other libraries, such as city-owned Jinling Library and various district libraries, also provide considerable amount of information to citizens. Nanjing University Library is the second largest university libraries in China after Peking University Library, and the fifth largest nationwide, especially in the number of precious collections.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNanjing has some of the oldest and finest museums in China. Nanjing Museum, formerly known as National Central Museum during ROC period, is the first modern museum and remains as one of the leading museums in China having 400,000 items in its permanent collection. The museum is notable for enormous collections of Ming and Qing imperial porcelain, which is among the largest in the world.\nOther museums include the City Museum of Nanjing in the Chaotian Palace, the Oriental Metropolitan Museum, the China Modern History Museum in the Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, the Taiping Kingdom History Museum, Jiangning Imperial Silk Manufacturing Museum, Nanjing Yunjin Museum, Nanjing City Wall Cultural Museum, Nanjing Customs Museum in Ganxi House, Nanjing Astronomical History Museum, Nanjing Paleontological Museum, Nanjing Geological Museum, Nanjing Riverstones Museum, and other museums and memorials such Zheng He Memorial Jinling Four Modern Calligraphers Memorial.\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nMost of Nanjing's major theaters are multi-purpose, used as convention halls, cinemas, musical halls and theaters on different occasions. The major theaters include the People's Convention Hall and the Nanjing Arts and Culture Center. The Capital Theater well known in the past is now a museum in theater/film.\n\n\n=== Night life ===\n\nTraditionally Nanjing's nightlife was mostly centered around Nanjing Fuzimiao (Confucius Temple) area along the Qinhuai River, where night markets, restaurants and pubs thrived. Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20 years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the Xinjiekou CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city. The well-established \"Nanjing 1912\" district hosts a wide variety of recreational facilities ranging from traditional restaurants and western pubs to dance clubs, in both its downtown location and beside Baijia Lake in Jiangning District. In recent years, many night-life options have opened up in Catherine Park as well as in shopping malls such as IST in Xinjiekou and Kingmo near Baijai Lake metro station. Other, more student-oriented places are to be found near to Nanjing University and Nanjing Normal University.\n\n\n=== Food and symbolism ===\nThe local cuisine in Nanjing is called Jinling cuisine (\u91d1\u9675\u83dc) or Jingsu cuisine (\u4eac\u82cf\u83dc); it is part of Jiangsu province's cuisine.  Jinling cuisine is famous for its meticulous process, emphasizing no added preservatives and its seasonality. Its duck and goose dishes are well known among Chinese for centuries.  It also employs many different style of cooking methods, such as slow cooking, Chinese oven cooking, etc. Its dishes tend to be light and fresh, suitable for all. The restaurant specializing in Jinling cuisine is Ma Xiang Xing (\u9a6c\u7965\u5174\u83dc\u9986).\nMany of the city's local favorite dishes are based on ducks, including Nanjing salted duck, duck blood and vermicelli soup, and duck oil pancake.The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing, which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China. According to Nanjing.GOV.cn, \"There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb. In the spring, the radish tastes very juicy and sweet. It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish. And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish', which means they are unsophisticated, passionate and conservative. From health perspective, eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival\".\n\n\n== Sports and stadiums ==\n\nNanjing's planned 20,000 seat Youth Olympic Sports Park Gymnasium will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nAs a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Suning FC, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league.\nThere are two major sports centers in Nanjing, Wutaishan Sports Center and Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Both of these two are comprehensive sports centers, including stadium, gymnasium, natatorium, tennis court, etc. Wutaishan Sports Center was established in 1952 and it was one of the oldest and most advanced stadiums in early time of People's Republic of China.\nNanjing hosted the 10th National Games of PRC in 2005 and hosted the 2nd summer Youth Olympic Games in 2014.\n\nIn 2005, to host The 10th National Game of People's Republic of China, there was a new stadium, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center, constructed in Nanjing. Compared to Wutaishan Sports Center, which the major stadium's capacity is 18,500, Nanjing Olympic Sports Center has a more advanced stadium which is big enough to seat 60,000 spectators. Its gymnasium has capacity of 13,000, and natatorium of capacity 3,000.\nOn 10 February 2010, the 122nd IOC session at Vancouver announced Nanjing as the host city for the 2nd Summer Youth Olympic Games. The slogan of the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was \"Share the Games, Share our Dreams\". The Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games featured all 28 sports on the Olympic program and were held from 16 to 28 August. The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee (NYOGOC) worked together with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to attract the best young athletes from around the world to compete at the highest level.

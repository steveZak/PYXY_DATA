        "wiki": "Nantes (, also US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303t] (listen); Gallo: Naunnt or Nantt [n\u0251\u0303(\u02d0)t]; Breton: Naoned [\u02c8n\u00e3un\u0259t]) is a city in Loire-Atlantique on the Loire, 50 km (31 mi) from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth-largest in France, with a population of  303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants. With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis.\nIt is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.\nNantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\nIn 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nNantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its confluence with the Erdre. The origin of the name \"Namnetes\" is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *nant- (river or stream, from the pre-Celtic root *nanto, valley) or from Amnites, another tribal name possibly meaning \"men of the river\".Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00fainkon) and \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kondio\u00fainkon)\u2014which might be read as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00faikon)\u2014in his treatise, Geography. The name was latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as Condevincum (the most common form), Condevicnum, Condivicnum and Condivincum. Although its origins are unclear, \"Condevincum\" seems to be related to the Gaulish word condate \"confluence\".The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as Portus Namnetum \"port of the Namnetes\" and civitas Namnetum \"city of the Namnetes\". Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one; Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes' name continued to evolve, becoming Naneti\u00e6 and Namnetis during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).\n\n\n=== Modern pronunciation and nicknames ===\nNantes is pronounced [n\u0251\u0303t], and the city's inhabitants are known as Nantais [n\u0251\u0303t\u025b]. In Gallo, the o\u00efl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled Naunnt or Nantt and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long [\u0251\u0303]. In Breton, Nantes is known as Naoned or an Naoned, the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton toponyms than in French ones.Nantes' historical nickname was \"Venice of the West\" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit\u00e9 des Ducs \"the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]\" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region's subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rez\u00e9) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes' inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing 16 hectares (40 acres), was one of the largest in Gaul.Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288\u2013290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nLike much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. After Charlemagne's death in 814,  Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city's main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). The 15th century is considered Nantes' first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. At the end of the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town. However, the edict did not reflect local opinion in the Catholic League stronghold. The local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000, and Nantes was one of the last places to resist the authority of Protestant-raised Henry IV. The edict was signed after the capitulation of the Duke of Merc\u0153ur, governor of Brittany.Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city's largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous h\u00f4tels particuliers.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nThe French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vend\u00e9e attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, Fran\u00e7ois de Charette, was executed in Nantes.After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire \"the national bathtub\".The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon's Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nOutlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from R\u00e9union in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on R\u00e9union sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours\u2013Saint-Nazaire railway.Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be transhipped before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a 15 kilometres (9.3 miles)-long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.\n\n\n=== Land reclamation ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as \"the 50 hostages\" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes' industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as \"Nantes Atlantique\" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.The death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nNantes is in north-western France, near the Atlantic Ocean and 342 kilometres (213 miles) south-west of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is  274 kilometres (170 miles) south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orl\u00e9ans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vend\u00e9e (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around 47\u00b013\u2032N 1\u00b032\u2032W).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe Loire is about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is 60 kilometres (37 miles) in length. The river's bed and banks have  changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about 30 kilometres (19 miles) further east. The tidal range can reach 6 metres (20 feet) in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the S\u00e8vre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nNantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 metres (125 feet) above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching 52 metres (171 feet) in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching 30 metres (98 feet). The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNantes has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. The climatic conditions allow to be typically in this zone with almost no influence of the continent as in Paris, the city has strict variations of temperatures and few freezing days in average annual, in addition to a precipitation higher, but also being able to be described informally as a \"Mediterranean altered\" for 1971-2000 normals. Rainfall and its pattern exemplifies this (winters rainier than other seasons), although it is a relatively high total fall in every month (too high average temperature), but in the future may be closer to a dry summer defined if trends persist. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F); snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). Rain is abundant through the year, with an annual average of 820 millimetres (32 inches). The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n\nNantes' layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes' most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and h\u00f4tels particuliers. The area was extended towards the Parc de Proc\u00e9 during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudi\u00e8re and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.\n\nAfter World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes' growing population. The oldest, Les Dervalli\u00e8res, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rez\u00e9, Vertou and Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and  north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.The 4.6-square-kilometre (1.8 sq mi) Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.\n\n\n=== Parks and environment ===\n\nNantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering 218 hectares (540 acres). The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old Magnolia grandiflora and the national collection of camellia. Other large parks include the Parc de Proc\u00e9, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudini\u00e8re, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional 180 hectares (440 acres), include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes' area.The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nNantes is the pr\u00e9fecture (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion. It is the residence of a r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement prefect, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement councils, two elected political bodies.\nThe city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers' Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes' first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold.Since 1995 Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (quartiers), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each  quartier to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes M\u00e9tropole, it encompasses the city's metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes M\u00e9tropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes M\u00e9tropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020 the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes M\u00e9tropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nLocal authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.Nantes' coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city's coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939\u201345 War Cross were added in 1948.Before the revolution, Nantes' motto was \"Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine\" (\"The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord\", a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto\u2014\"Favet Neptunus eunti\" (\"Neptune favours the traveller\")\u2014in 1816. Nantes' flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.\n\n\n=== Nantes and Brittany ===\n\nNantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five d\u00e9partements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining d\u00e9partements into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement formed a new region with four other d\u00e9partements, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (\"Loire Countries\") although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe P\u00e9tain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.Debate continues about Nantes' place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is  similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.\n\n\n=== Twinning ===\n\nNantes has made nine international sister-city arrangements since 1964. Arrangements have been made with:\nCardiff, Wales (1964)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Germany (1965)\nTbilisi, Georgia (1979)\nSeattle and Jacksonville, Florida (1980-1984)\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (1991)\nNiigata, Niigata, Japan (1999)\nDurban, South Africa (2005)\nQingdao, China (2005)\nSuncheon, Jeonnam, South Korea (2007)The city has made agreements with other cities and regions, including Turin, Liverpool, Hamburg, Asturias and Quebec. Partnership agreements have been signed with cities in developing countries, including Dschang, Cameroon, Grand'Anse, Haiti and Kindia, Guinea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nNantes had 298,029 inhabitants in 2016, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes' population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring communes of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding communes. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity, religions and languages ===\n\nNantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.Nantes is historically a Catholic city, with a cathedral, two minor basilicas, about 40 churches and around 20 chapels. Western France is traditionally religious, and the Catholic influence on Nantes was more persistent than in other large French cities. However, it has waned since the 1970s because of the rise of atheism and secularism. Although Nantes is where Protestantism was permitted in France through its edict, Protestants have always formed a small minority. The main Protestant church belongs to the United Protestant Church of France, but the city also has a number of newer Evangelical and Baptist churches. Nantes had a small Jewish community during the Middle Ages, but Jews were expelled from Brittany in 1240 and Judaism only reappeared after the French Revolution. The city has one synagogue, built in 1852. The city had several hundred Muslim inhabitants during the 1950s, but (as in the rest of France) their number increased in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of large numbers of Africans and Turks. Nantes' first mosque was built in 1976, with three more built in 2010\u20132012.The city is part of the territory of the langues d'o\u00efl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (parler nantais) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFor centuries, Nantes' economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN Biscuit), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with 500,000 square metres (5,400,000 square feet) of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.\n\nThe city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing \u20ac55 billion annually; \u20ac29 billion returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes M\u00e9tropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseilles, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region's largest retail area  with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France's seventh-most-visited city.In 2014, 74.6 percent of the city's businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes\u2013Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nNantes' cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-\u00c9tienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside  the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.\n\nSeveral 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes' medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes' chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860. \n\nAfter the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the pr\u00e9fecture, 1763\u20131783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790\u20131815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the h\u00f4tels particuliers and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called \"Nantais baroque\".\n\nMost of Nantes' churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840\u20131843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lef\u00e8vre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city's largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.The Dobr\u00e9e Museum, closed for repairs as of 2017, houses the d\u00e9partement's archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany's heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a  12-metre-tall (39 ft), walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the Machines were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes' largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nLe Z\u00e9nith Nantes M\u00e9tropole, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France's largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes' largest venue is La Cit\u00e9, Nantes Events Center, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre universitaire and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nThe Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan's Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.Estuaire contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet and Dan Graham.La Folle Journ\u00e9e (The Mad Day, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfi\u00e8re d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univercin\u00e9 (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.\n\n\n=== Slavery Memorial ===\nA path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word \u201cfreedom\u201d written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st.  At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.\n\n\n=== In the arts ===\n\nNantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since Andr\u00e9 Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vach\u00e9 there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), Andr\u00e9 Breton called Nantes \"perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me\". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 M\u00e9moires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Mus\u00e9e noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: Lola (1964) and A Room in Town (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include God's Thunder by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re (1965), The Married Couple of the Year Two by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), Day Off by Pascal Thomas (2001) and Black Venus by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard's Keep Your Right Up was filmed at its airport in 1987.Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007's \"Nantes\" by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include \"Nantes\" by Barbara (1964) and \"Nantes\" by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. \"Dans les prisons de Nantes\" is the most popular, with versions recorded by \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include \"Le pont de Nantes\" (recorded by Guy B\u00e9art in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), \"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Nantes\" (a sea shanty) and the bawdy \"De Nantes \u00e0 Montaigu\".British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the \"special character\" of the local \"plebeian\" cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes' largest and best-known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.Beurre blanc is Nantes' most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), berlingot (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar rigolette sweets with marmalade filling, g\u00e2teau nantais (a rum cake invented in 1820), Cur\u00e9 nantais and M\u00e2checoulais cheeses and fouace, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien R\u00e9gime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013\u20132014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000.

Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a 43-kilometre (27 mi) ring road around the city, France's second-longest after the ring in Bordeaux.Nantes' central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercit\u00e9s trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orl\u00e9ans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) south-east of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as \"Tan\". One of the world's first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of 43.5 kilometres (27.0 miles) of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Ch\u00e2teaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.\n\n\n=== Nantes Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Nantes & Saint-Nazaire, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 40 min. 7.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

          "This garden is one of the first things a visitor sees after arriving by train. It beckons from across the street. We're easily seduced by gardens, so we were ecstatic to wander this one, which our researches recommended. As we were to learn over the next several days, Nantes is",

          "We found this gem just five minutes from the station in Nantes. Botanical park is a bit misleading, if it makes you think of Kew. It's much smaller, and it's free to enter. It was actually designed to be a park \"in the English style\". It is beautifully landscaped, with many",
          "We loved these quirky gardens, which were as interesting as they were beautiful. Lots to see and do, and ample space to sit down and soak up the sun. The cafe outside the park (caf\u00e9 de plantes) is also very good.",

        "wiki": "Nantes Cathedral, or the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul of Nantes (French: Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul de Nantes), is a Roman Catholic church located in Nantes, Pays de la Loire, France. The cathedral is in the Gothic architectural tradition. Construction of the church began in 1434, on the site of a Romanesque cathedral, and took 457 years to finish, finally reaching completion in 1891. It has been listed since 1862 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe reconstruction of the cathedral commenced during the early to mid-15th century during a time when Nantes and Brittany were commercially prosperous, initiating such large-scale architectural projects on a wide scale, partly owing to the opportunist and skilful diplomatic policy of John V in a period of political turmoil and conflict with England.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cathedral's foundation stone was laid on 14 April 1434, by John V, Duke of Brittany and Jean de Malestroit, Bishop of Nantes (1417\u20131443). The first architect in charge was Guillaume de Dammartin who was later replaced by Mathurin Rodier. The construction began with the west fa\u00e7ade, the aisles of the nave and its lateral chapels.Leniaud et al. divide the building process in five phases. The first phase took place between c. 1434 and c. 1470. In this period the west fa\u00e7ade and the tower bay were built, as were the south aisle of the nave with its chapels, and the south arcade pillars. The bases of those pillars resemble the ones of the choir of Mont-Saint-Michel, which was begun after 1444. The arms of Duke John, who died in 1442, were placed in the staircase to the balcony, above the ducal portal, on the south side of the southern tower bay. The vaults in the belfry of that tower were decorated with the arms of Bishop Guillaume de Malestroit (1443\u20131462). The triforium of the tower bay was constructed in an earlier and different style (Late Gothic Flamboyant, with a network of reticulated tracery) than the one of the nave proper. Bronze decoration of the central portal's doors was undertaken in 1482.\nThe second phase took place from c. 1470 to c. 1490. During this time the nave, the north aisle and its chapels were built. They were completed by 1485 or slightly later. The west wall of the north transept and the north-west crossing pier, perhaps up to capital height, were also constructed in this period.\n\nIn the third phase, c.1500\u20131516, the glass in the great west window was installed (1498), as a gift from Queen Anne. In 1500 took place the vaulting of the first bay of the nave. From 1508 to 1516 the eastern bay of the south aisle of the nave and its chapel was completed and vaulted; the south transept was begun, finishing most of the upper parts of its western wall by 1519\u20131520. The financial support came from Bishop Guillaume Guegen and the architect was Jacques Drouet.\nThe last phase is the post-medieval one. It spanned from c.1626 to 1630 and led to the completion of the nave high vaulting (four eastern bays) and the construction of the nave flyers. The south transept was completed sometime between 1631 and 1637 or perhaps later, in a sympathetic Gothic style. Louis Le Vau recommended to the Chapter at Nantes, in about 1650, to build the choir in a Gothic style.\nThe rest of the north transept and the choir, under the direction of St. Felix Seheult (city architect), were finished between 1840 and 1891, at a time of keen revival of the Catholic faith. The long wait was also due to the fact that the former Romanesque church was standing right next to the city's protective walls, which had to be taken down before completing the choir, while destroying the remains of the previous cathedral as it was covered by the larger, new one.\nThe edifice was damaged by Allied bombing during World War II, on 15 June 1944. On 28 January 1972, a gigantic fire started on the roof. Firemen managed to bring it under control, but the timber frame was severely damaged and many other damages were inflicted. This event led to what was undoubtedly the most complete interior restoration of a cathedral in France.\nThe elevation and the regularity of the plan of the cathedral are French. Still the majority of the details are Late Gothic, e.g., the absence of capitals, the plinths with concave sides and separated bases for the shafts, the Flamboyant tracery, and the masking of the piers by shafts.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Dimensions ===\nHeight of the towers \u2013 63 m (192 ft)\nHeight of the roof \u2013 49 m (149 ft)\nHeight of nave \u2013 37.5 m (114 ft)\nInterior width \u2013 38.5 m (117 ft)\nInterior length \u2013 103 m (335 ft)\nLength of the chancel \u2013 30 m (91 ft)\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe facade of the Cathedral of Nantes is dominated by two large towers, stretching up above the top terrace. It presents several remarkable characteristics, e.g., (1) the presence of an external pulpit, designed to preach to the crowd assembled on the square, and (2) the presence of five richly decorated gates, three of them on the fa\u00e7ade and two to the sides (see Ground plan, positions 1 - Main Gate, 2 - Gate of St. Paul, 3 - Gate of St. Yves, 32 - Gate of St. Donatien and St. Rogatien and 33 - Gate of St. Peter).\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe plain fa\u00e7ade is largely compensated for by the polish of the interior of the building. The whiteness of the stone, accentuated by recent restoration work, the imposing dimensions of the nave and the aisles and the effect of the immense inner column create a Gothic atmosphere inside the cathedral.\nInside the cathedral are the tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany (position 10) and of his wife Marguerite de Foix, the (parents of Anne of Brittany), made at the beginning of the 16th century by Michel Colombe and Jean Perr\u00e9al. The cathedral also houses the cenotaph of General de Lamorici\u00e8re (position 23), a monument set up in 1878 in papal homage to him.\n\n\n== Other information ==\nIn front of the cathedral, on 5 September 1661, on the order of Louis XIV, Nicolas Fouquet was arrested by d'Artagnan.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCocke, T.

          "This is a fine example of good architecture. It may look a bit severe and massive, especially if you prefer some other less cold styles, but it deserves a visit. Although there was a fire forty years ago, the restauration works were very outstandingly accurate, so I didn\u00b4t",

          "Nice cathedral which was heavily bombed and rebuild. Gothic in style with modern windows the cathedral has not lost its charm. It has a mystical feel and the work done positively renders the work done.",
          "This is a large cathedral and is easy to find since it is close to/in Nantes old town area. The cathedral was built over a five hundred year period staying in the mid-1400's. It is definitely worth an hour of your time when in Nantes.",

          "I was surprised by the ceilingheight of Cathedrale St-Pierre et St-Paul,s, it seemed like the highest of the many Cathedrals we have visited during our month rouring France, but not mentioned as such. It's big and impressive, very well maintained. It houses the tomb of the last",
          "The height of the nave is awesome. The tomb of Francois II, saved by the town architect during the French Revolution, is magnificent. The stained glass window showing Breton and Nantes saints is beautiful.",

          "We walked a bit around the cathedral, trying not to disturb the mass in Progress. It was very beutiful and well renovated, worth taking a walk around as well as seeing from the inside. Free admission and a must-see in Nantes",

          "This is a lovely cathedral and I was lucky enough to enter when the choir was practicing. And yes, it is FULL for Sunday mass. It is, however, FREEZING inside. The tombs are spectacular. Be sure to use the viewing platform - it is easily missed.",
          "Francis II is buried here. He built the Ch\u00e2teau in Nantes. There has been a cathedral here as far back as the 6th century when St. Felix had it built. There is a St. Felix chapel inside. This version of the cathedral is in Gothic style and was not fully completed Untill 1891.",
          "When visiting Nantes, one should not miss visiting the imposing, gothic style Saint Pierre et Paul cathedral. The construction took 457 years to finish and it has its unique architecture details like the presence of an external pulpit. The vitrailes are beautiful and it is a",

          "Stumbled across this place on a wonder about the old town of Nantes. It's set a little back from the main streets, but towers over everything. Had to go and look inside! Inside you are immediately struck but the sheet height of the vaulted ceilings. The place is kept very clean",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the heart of Nantes. funny how there is a70s era clock on the front. Check the sculptures inside.",
          "The church had beautiful chapels surrounding its sides.2 massive pipe organs still functional. The tombs of the General Lamoriciere and Francois II the Duke of Brittany and his second wife. They have beautiful stained glass windows but most of them are more recent after the",
          "A lovely cathedral. Even though much of the stained glass is modern, this doesn't detract. The tombs are well worth seeing.",
          "We had about 2 hours so we ran from our hotel to this cathedral and it was very beautiful. There were lots of signs telling its history but in French!! so we didn't understand.",
          "This cathedral started construction in the 15th century and was finally completed 450 odd years later in the 19th century. The cathedral is the burial place of Duke Francis II, with a very elaborate tomb. If your in Nantes, spend 15-20 minutes just to walk around and see the",
          "We take visitors for visits, but it is the diocesan cathedral so for worship, not visits, though of course visitors are always welcome, just to look round or for services.",

          "We wanted to see the wonderful tombs of Francis II and his duchess, and weren't disappointed. The building is unusual in that it so white and clean: a consequence of the rebuilding after the fire in the 1970s.",

          "I enjoy visiting churches whenever in a new place. The Cathedral blew me away. It has soaring heights. The stained glass is just wonderful. It is modern design, Nd will not be to everyone's taste. For me, the colours vary from each window but have a unity of design. Because of a",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit. The building was flattened in the war and the re-built structure was badly damaged in a fire relatively recently. The new white stone is a revelation, it looks exactly as it did when it was built hundreds of years ago!",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning when it was nearly full because a mass was being conducted. We returned in the afternoon to tour the building when we would not disturb the service. We enjoyed the quiet. It contains several significant tombs including those of Francis II, Duke",
          "We are regular visitors to Nantes and never miss an opportunity to visit this magnificent Cathedral. We are based at Camping Nantes and caught a No. 2 Tram into the city. Alighted at tram stop \"Commerce\". Crossed the road and continued up Rue de de la Barillerie to Place Saint",
          "Beautiful cathedral, the stain glass windows are worthy of the visit, the ambiance inside the cathedral is of much respect",

          "The architecture of this Cathedrale was amazing! The intricate details on the front were spectacular. The inside of the Cathedrale was very pretty and the stain glass windows were very impressive. The best bit? It was very quiet so you could take time to admire the building",

          "Imposing building with high ceiling, clean and elegant lines and very bright interior. The crypt is well worth the visit with some fine displays of cathedral\u2019s and Nantes\u2019 history.",
          "Stunning and interesting building close to the chateau. Gives a good overview to the history of Nantes",
          "Lovely cathedral filled with light, very pleasant visit, and there is a free display of historical cathedral artefacts in the crypt, as well as a display on the history of the cathedral. Particularly nice on a hot afternoon as it's so cool down there.",
          "It's nice and beautiful outside of the church. And very high ceiling. If you are traveling here don't forget to look inside.",
          "Very pretty with amazingly high ceilings and extremely bright inside. Definately with a stroll inside to see.",
          "This beautiful gothic cathedral has the most stunning stained glass windows. The cathedral is warm and inviting and almost seems modern due to its bright appearance. We were able to watch a young lady power washing one of the altar carvings to restore it to pristine condition.",
          "Nantes isn't really on the tourist trail yet it's cathedral is worthy a detour by any a traveller. It is as grand and awe-inspiring as any of the great cathedrals of the world with magnificent halls emblazoned in the very best masons of all time. It deserves a long lingering",
          "a big cathdral, with spectacular architecture, however there was a fire in 1972 and it seems that many items from the original dcor wer lost, making the visit less enjoyable",
          "Visiting the Cathedral was not what we expected. We normally visit churches and cathedrals in our holiday, this was one which we could have skipped. Not as special as we thought.",
          "It really is quite high inside. A lot of the side altars were missing - possibly lost in the fire of 1972. There wasn't very much to keep us inside, but worth a look-in as it has stood there for so many centuries.",
          "On arrival, the organ was being played. Sounded amazing. Lots of small chapels. Alter was very simple and modern. Lovely fresh lilies scented the air. Very quiet and peaceful.",
          "Clearly this cathedral is a very impressive building, largely constructed when the city was one of the wealthiest places in France. It is definitely worth a thorough look although it does not, in my opinion, compare with the finest cathedrals in France. Nonetheless well worth a",
          "I like visiting churches for their beauty, and this one doesn't disappoint. The inside is just as majestic as the exterior. This cathedral like others has its own history but putting that aside the sculptures and carvings are impressive. It has been standing there for many",
          "It is steeped in history, very solemn and interesting. The different small chapels inside the Cathedral all have their own story.",
          "I was not expecting much but I was awestruck by the majestic interior upon entering. It is really old - the building started in 1434 and it continued for about 450 years! I reccommend a visit there, even a short one. The entry is free but you can't enter during the Sunday",
          "A beautiful and tranquil place to forget about the hustle and bustle of the world outside and relax. There are some amazing statues and beautiful stained glass windows. You can pick up a leaflet inside for a small donation which tells you all about the cathedral, it's artwork,",
          "Wonderful cathedrals in the centre of Nantes - will definitely come back again - only shortcoming all interesting explanations in French only",

          "It doesn't cost anything to enter and is definitely worth seeing whilst you're in Nantes whether you're religious or not/",
          "Always a joy to visit whether you are a religious person or not (and I'm not). It never looses its magic with its huge ancient wooden doors, and all of its centuries of history. You are immediately transported back in time to the 13th century. A wonderful building to visit,",
          "A beautiful Cathedral in a beautiful city. A magnificent testament to the faith, vision and building skills of people of a bygone age.",
          "It definetely worths a visit among other things for the impressive sculpted tombs of Anne de Bretagne's parents: Fran\u00e7ois II and his wife. Beautiful masterpiece!",
          "In the heart of the city...absolutely beautiful. This was the firs cathedral in Europe I had ever visited and was really impressed by it's beauty. Definitely worth a stop. My favourite place we visited in Nantes. We also happened to be there on a day that the crypts were opened",
          "Sit and mediate for a few moments and appreciate the space around you. It is a magnificent cathedral and well worth spending songs time there.",
          "Right in the heart of the city of Nantes is the Cathedrale de St.Pierre et St. Paul. It has been lovingly rebuilt and restored after being nearly destroyed in bombing raids during the Second World War. The medieval tomb of the parents of Anne, Duchesse of Bretagne is simply",

          "When we visited the cathedral there was a wedding in progress, after waiting for 10-15 minutes we could enter. The thing that fascinated me the most was the color of the stained glasses.",
          "While in Nantes i chanced upon this cathedral whiel walking admiring the christmas atmosphere in December. Lots of people were coming out of the cathedral so I went in and discovered a pipe organ recital. It was amazing. Although the recital was happening I wandered around",

          "I planned on a quick tour through this church. Two hours later I was still examining the walls. The tomb of Anne of Brittany's parents keep my attention for quite a while. At night the cathedral is beautifully lit. On some days a gentleman rolls his piano in front the church to",
          "Visited the striking outside of the cathedral many times as we visited Nantes for a short break as it is so central in the city but ventured inside on a rainy first day of the year. The peace and serenity of the interior is created by the quite plain decoration and clean lines.",
          "The cathedral is so beautiful. It is imponent in the middle of Nantes! Enjoy to walk through the little streets around the cathedral, and when you get there and see the amazing gotic reconstrutured structure, say THANKS to God!!",
          "- The church is big and looks impressive from outside - Located in middle of the city so it is easy to be accessed - Interior details of the church is worthy to be seen and explored as well",
          "France is covered up with cathedrals, of course, but this one has an interesting story. It's a relative latecomer. Construction started here in 1434, almost 200 years later than some of the more famous cathedrals, such as Chartres or Reims. One of the interesting features is",
          "Not sure when you can visit the crypt, but interesting if you can get down there. Cathedral dates from C5 has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. I love history, very historic, not spoiled by loads of tombs etc. the organ is good if it is playing when you are there. Leaflets",
          "it lacks the grandeur of other cathedrals, probably because it was only finished at the end of the 19th century. In 1972 it suffered a fire, which resulted in more restauration (and less old charm).",
          "My family has ties to this cathedral and I visited because of that. I would say it is worth the visit but not outstanding",
          "I was truly amazed at the restoration of this lovely building after a devasting fire I think in the 1970's. The architecture on the outside is traditional , but there is a lovely modern low communion table, chair and lectern which blends beautifully with the traditional",
          "A must see exterior with exquisite carved stone features on the front. Great architecture. I have a jaundiced view of interiors of churches - they all look the same - sorry. Watty",
          "I had an afternoon to walk around Nantes before flying out the next day so I made a point of visiting the Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne, the Castle...... From the walls of the castle I could see this church so I walked over. Having lived in Quito and visited the many beautiful",
          "A beautiful building and I urge you to visit. It is majestic and spiritual. The height of the walls is breath taking. The stained glass windows, the tomb of Richard the Second of Bretagne and the Memorial to the English Soldiers who died in the two world wars, make this a place",
          "The height and depth of the nave in this Cathedral are breathtaking. It's stone-work is also beautifully clean, having been restored after a fire in 1972. There are many wonderful features to find and this cathedral deserves a good close look inside. The sculpture of the tomb",
          "We visited Nantes on a Sunday and therefore it was easy to park in the underground car park quite centrally. We immediately saw the cathedral set high up - this was the back view where we climbed up a flight of large steps flanked by monuments and saw the large column with",
          "This cathedral has to be viewed by any tourist in Nantes. When we were there it was not crowded and we could view it at out leisure.",
          "Nice architecture - elegant in the inside. I couldn't stop taking pictures of the details. Nearby it is a great parking",
          "As you would expect, impressive. However I am frequently disappointed at the presentation of information or lack of it. Not just here but generally. There seems little imagination or effort applied to providing visitors with interesting information to enable them to make the",
          "It is quite beautiful and relatively simply decorated inside. But the most interesting thing is the sense if things not being quite 'right'...and you realize, if you stand in the exact middle at the back of the nave, that the whole front (apse) is skewed to the left by maybe",
          "Beautiful church. Dates from the time of Anne de Bretagne. The tomb for her parents is there. Walk up the stairs to see the statuary. Very loving memorial. Note that there is a self-portrait of the artist who created the statues of the four graces. His image in at the back",
          "This is a lovely place to visit. Nantes is a very quaint old place and it's worth taking a tour of this cathedral. Nantes isn't huge so you can get around it quite quickly.",
          "A really nice cathedral with a the gorgeous tomb of Fran\u00e7ois II Duke of Brittany wich is the highlight of the visit",
          "Excellent! Lots to see in the Cathedral. I'd make sure I did this place if you are short on time. It has to be the brightest and have the whitest stones of any structure that I've seen so far. The cathedral has been recently renovated and has one of the largest pipe organs.",
          "took the train car tour around the city,30 mins, 15 euro for family of four, only good thing about our trip to Nantes, but no English language on the guide tour so haven't a clue what all the places were that we seen.",
          "A rather average cathedral. Some nice cloisters buts that's really about it. There is little else to do in Nantes as its fairly dull and uninspiring and very run down,and not a city worth bothering with.",

          "If you go in through the crypt it is the best way to start seeing the Cathedral, it is full of really good solid information on the historical aspects of the building and the local area. Very good relics to see.",
          "I'm not a church-goer,but this cathedral is well worth a visit,just awesome inside and out. This houses the tomb of Frances 2nd,public entry only when not in service use. Tour bus leaves from the car park area outside here",
          "The unusual white-white stone makes the architecture in this classic Gothic cathedral even more transcendent than others. Don't miss the beautiful tomb of Francis II and his wife, the parents of local heroine Anne of Bretagne.",
          "Worth the visit during the day as it is very bright with great stained glass windows. The crypt is also of interest.",
          "The cathedral is handsome, with soaring, unbroken columns shooting directly into the vaults. The interior is not as spectacular as some, and most glass is not ancient. Don't miss the tomb of Francois II, and the beautiful surrounding statues of the Four Virtues at each corner.",
          "Beautiful large cathedral going through a restoration, beautiful stained glass windows and the burial site of some of the significant Dukes and Duchesses of Brittany. Although I didn't know it at the time, there are also crypts below.",
          "The Cathedral is still undergoing restoration following a devastating fire in the 1970s but is breathtaking in its simplicity. Well worth a visit.",
          "We arrived here on Monday morning so it was very quiet which made visiting more enjoyable. So much to see and details within it is good to come earlier in the day. Make sure to walk around the outside of the cathedral to really appreciate the architecture and history."

        "wiki": "Lyon or Lyons (UK: , US: , French: [lj\u0254\u0303] (listen); Arpitan: Liyon, pronounced [\u028ej\u0254\u0303]; Italian: Lione, pronounced [li\u02c8one]) is the third-largest city and second-largest urban area of France. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south of Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north of Marseille and 56 km (35 mi) northeast of Saint-\u00c9tienne. Inhabitants of the city are called Lyonnais.\nLyon had a population of 513,275 in 2015. It is the capital of the Metropolis of Lyon and the region of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The Lyon metropolitan area had a population of 2,265,375 in 2014. The city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Lyon was historically an important area for the production and weaving of silk. Lyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph. It is also known for its light festival, the F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, which begins every 8 December and lasts for four days, earning Lyon the title of Capital of Lights.\nEconomically, Lyon is a major centre for banking, as well as for the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The city contains a significant software industry with a particular focus on video games, and in recent years has fostered a growing local start-up sector. Lyon hosts the international headquarters of Interpol, the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Euronews. According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute, Lyon is considered a Beta city, as of 2018. It ranked second in France and 40th globally in Mercer's 2019 liveability rankings.\n\n\n== History of Lyon ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Lyon ===\n\nAccording to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered the creation of a settlement for Roman refugees of war with the Allobroges. These refugees had been expelled from Vienne and were now encamped at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rh\u00f4ne rivers. The foundation was built on Fourvi\u00e8re hill and officially called Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum). The earliest translation of this Gaulish place-name as \"Desired Mountain\" is offered by the 9th-century Endlicher Glossary. In contrast, some modern scholars have proposed a Gaulish hill-fort named Lug[o]dunon, after the Celtic god Lugus ('Light', cognate with Old Irish Lugh, Modern Irish L\u00fa), and d\u00fanon (hill-fort).\n\nThe Romans recognised that Lugdunum's strategic location at the convergence of two navigable rivers made it a natural communications hub. The city became the starting point of main Roman roads in the area, and it quickly became the capital of the province, Gallia Lugdunensis. Two Emperors were born in this city: Claudius, whose speech is preserved in the Lyon Tablet in which he justifies the nomination of Gallic Senators, and Caracalla.\nEarly Christians in Lyon were martyred for their beliefs under the reigns of various Roman emperors, most notably Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Local saints from this period include Blandina, Pothinus, and Epipodius, among others. The Greek Irenaeus was the second bishop of Lyon during the latter part of the second century. To this day, the archbishop of Lyon is still referred to as \"Primat des Gaules\".Burgundians fleeing the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 437 were re-settled at Lugdunum. In 443 the Romans established the Kingdom of the Burgundians, and Lugdunum became its capital in 461. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, Lyon went to the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I. It later was made part of the Kingdom of Arles. Lyon did not come under French control until the 14th century.\n\n\n=== Modern Lyon ===\nFernand Braudel remarked, \"Historians of Lyon are not sufficiently aware of the bi-polarity between Paris and Lyon, which is a constant structure in French development...from the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution\". In the late 15th century, the fairs introduced by Italian merchants made Lyon the economic counting house of France. Even the Bourse (treasury), built in 1749, resembled a public bazaar where accounts were settled in the open air. When international banking moved to Genoa, then Amsterdam, Lyon remained the banking centre of France.\nDuring the Renaissance, the city's development was driven by the silk trade, which strengthened its ties to Italy. Italian influence on Lyon's architecture is still visible among historic buildings. In the late 1400s and 1500s Lyon was also a key centre of literary activity and book publishing, both of French writers (such as Maurice Sc\u00e8ve, Antoine Heroet, and Louise Lab\u00e9) and of Italians in exile (such as Luigi Alamanni and Gian Giorgio Trissino).\n\nIn 1572, Lyon was a scene of mass violence by Catholics against Protestant Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Two centuries later, Lyon was again convulsed by violence when, during the French Revolution, the citizenry rose up against the National Convention and supported the Girondins. The city was besieged by Revolutionary armies for over two months before surrendering in October 1793. Many buildings were destroyed, especially around the Place Bellecour, while Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois and Joseph Fouch\u00e9 administered the execution of more than 2,000 people. The Convention ordered that its name be changed to \"Liberated City\" and a plaque was erected that proclaimed \"Lyons made war on Liberty; Lyons no longer exists.\" A decade later, Napoleon ordered the reconstruction of all the buildings demolished during this period.\nThe Convention was not the only target within Lyon during the 1789-1799 French Revolution. After the National Convention faded into history, the French Directory appeared and days after the September 4, 1797, Coup of 18 Fructidor, a Directory's commissioner was assassinated in Lyon.\nThe city became an important industrial town during the 19th century. In 1831 and 1834, the canuts (silk workers) of Lyon staged two major uprisings for better working conditions and pay. In 1862, the first of Lyon's extensive network of funicular railways began operation.\nDuring World War II, Lyon was a centre for the occupying Nazi forces, including Klaus Barbie, the infamous \"Butcher of Lyon\". But the city was also a stronghold of the French Resistance \u2013 the many secret passages known as traboules enabled people to escape Gestapo raids. On 3 September 1944, Lyon was liberated by the 1st Free French Division and the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Int\u00e9rieur. The city is now home to a resistance museum.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne converge to the south of the historic city centre, forming a peninsula \u2013 the \"Presqu'\u00eele\" \u2013 bounded by two large hills to the west and north and a large plain eastward. Place Bellecour is located on the Presqu'\u00eele between the two rivers and is the third-largest public square in France. The broad, pedestrian-only Rue de la R\u00e9publique leads north from Place Bellecour.\nThe northern hill is La Croix-Rousse, known as \"the hill that works\" because it is traditionally home to many small silk workshops, an industry for which the city has long been renowned.The western hill is Fourvi\u00e8re, known as \"the hill that prays\" because it is the location for Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re basilica, several convents, and Archbishop residence. The district, Vieux Lyon, also hosts the Tour m\u00e9tallique (a highly visible TV tower, replicating the last stage of the Eiffel Tower) and one of the city's funicular railways. Fourvi\u00e8re, along with portions of the Presqu'\u00eele and much of La Croix-Rousse, is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.East of the Rh\u00f4ne from the Presqu'\u00eele is a large flat area upon which sits much of modern Lyon and contains most of the city's population. Situated in this area is La Part-Dieu urban centre, which clusters the landmark structures Tour Part-Dieu, Tour Oxyg\u00e8ne, and Tour Swiss Life, as well as the city's primary railway station, Gare de Lyon-Part-Dieu.\nNorth of this district lays the sixth arrondissement, which is home to one of Europe's largest urban parks, the Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, as well as Lyc\u00e9e du Parc and Interpol's world headquarters.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLyon has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa), bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb) due to the higher average temperature being around 22 \u00b0C. But in modified classifications such as that of Trewartha, France's third largest city has an oceanic climate (Do).  The mean temperature in Lyon in the coldest month is 3.2 \u00b0C (37.8 \u00b0F) in January and in the warmest month in July is 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F). Precipitation is adequate year-round, at an average of 830 mm (32.7 in), but the winter months are the driest. The highest recorded temperature was 40.5 \u00b0C (104.9 \u00b0F) on 13 August 2003 while the lowest recorded temperature was \u221224.6 \u00b0C (\u221212.3 \u00b0F) on 22 December 1938.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nLike Paris and Marseille, the city of Lyon is divided into a number of municipal arrondissements, each of which is identified by a number and has its own council and town hall. Five arrondissements were originally created in 1852, when three neighbouring communes (La Croix-Rousse, La Guilloti\u00e8re, and Vaise) were annexed by Lyon. Between 1867 and 1959, the third arrondissement (which originally covered the whole of the Left Bank of the Rh\u00f4ne) was split three times, creating a new arrondissement in each case. Then, in 1963, the commune of Saint-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe was annexed to Lyon's fifth arrondissement. A year later, in 1964, the fifth was split to create Lyon's 9th \u2013 and, to date, final \u2013 arrondissement. Within each arrondissement, the recognisable quartiers or neighbourhoods are:\n\n1st arrondissement: Slopes of La Croix-Rousse, Terreaux, Martini\u00e8re/St-Vincent\n2nd arrondissement: Cordeliers, Bellecour, Ainay, Perrache, Confluence, Sainte-Blandine\n3rd arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (north), Pr\u00e9fecture, Part-Dieu, Villette, Dauphin\u00e9/Sans Souci, Montchat, Grange Blanche (north), Monplaisir (north)\n4th arrondissement: Plateau de la Croix-Rousse, Serin\n5th arrondissement: Vieux Lyon (Saint-Paul, Saint-Jean, Saint-Georges), Saint-Just, Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Fourvi\u00e8re, Point du Jour, M\u00e9nival, Batti\u00e8res, Champvert (south)\n6th arrondissement: Brotteaux, Bellecombe, Parc de la T\u00eate d'or, Cit\u00e9 Internationale\n7th arrondissement: Guilloti\u00e8re (south), Jean Mac\u00e9, Gerland\n8th arrondissement: Monplaisir (south), Bachut, \u00c9tats-Unis, Grand Trou/Moulin \u00e0 Vent, Grange Blanche (south), La\u00ebnnec, Mermoz, Monplaisir-la-Plaine\n9th arrondissement: Vaise, Duch\u00e8re, Rochecardon, St-Rambert-l'\u00cele-Barbe, Gorge de Loup, Observance, Champvert (north)Geographically, Lyon's two main rivers, the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne, divide the arrondissements into three groups:\n\nTo the west of the Sa\u00f4ne, the fifth arrondissement covers the old city (Vieux Lyon), Fourvi\u00e8re hill and the plateau beyond. The 9th is immediately to the north, and stretches from Gorge de Loup, through Vaise to the neighbouring suburbs of \u00c9cully, Champagne-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Didier-au-Mont-d'Or, Saint-Cyr-au-Mont-d'Or and Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or.\nBetween the two rivers, on the Presqu'\u00eele, are the second, first, and fourth arrondissements. The second includes most of the city centre,  Bellecour and Perrache railway station, and reaches as far as the confluence of the two rivers. The first is directly to the north of the second and covers part of the city centre (including the H\u00f4tel de Ville) and the slopes of La Croix-Rousse. To the north of the Boulevard is the fourth arrondissement, which covers the Plateau of La Croix-Rousse, up to its boundary with the commune of Caluire-et-Cuire.\nTo the east of the Rh\u00f4ne, are the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth arrondissements.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Roman ruins on the hillside near the Fourvi\u00e8re Basilica, with the Ancient Theatre of Fourvi\u00e8re, the Odeon of Lyon and the accompanying Gallo-Roman museum;\nAmphitheatre of the Three Gauls \u2013 ruins of a Roman amphitheatre.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nCathedral of St. John, a medieval church with architectural elements of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, also the principal religious structure in the city and the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon;\nBasilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, one of the rare surviving Romanesque basilica-style churches in Lyon;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Paul, Romanesque (12th and 13th century) and Gothic (15th\u201316th century) church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Bonaventure, 14th- and 15th-century Gothic church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Nizier, Gothic church from the 15th century, having a doorway carved in the 16th century by Philibert Delorme;\nVieux Lyon (English: Old Lyon) area, Medieval and Renaissance quarter of the town, with shops, dining and cobbled streets;\nThe many Renaissance h\u00f4tels particuliers of the Old Lyon quarter, such as the H\u00f4tel de Bullioud, were also built by Philibert Delorme.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\nCity Hall on the Place des Terreaux, built by architects Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte;\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon, fine arts museum housed in a former convent of the 17th century, including the Baroque chapelle Saint-Pierre;\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon (17th and 18th century), historical hospital with a baroque chapel;\nTemple du Change (17th and 18th century), former stock exchange of Lyon, Protestant temple since the 18th century;\nPlace Bellecour, one of the largest town squares in Europe;\nChapelle de la Trinit\u00e9 (1622), the first Baroque chapel built in Lyon, and part of the former \u00c9cole de la Trinit\u00e9, now Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Amp\u00e8re;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Polycarpe (1665\u20131670), Classical church;\n\u00c9glise Saint-Just (16th to 18th century), Classical church;\nSaint-Bruno des Chartreux (17th and 18th century), church, masterpiece of Baroque architecture;\n\u00c9glise Notre Dame Saint-Vincent (18th century), Neo-classical church.\n\n\n=== 19th century and modern city ===\nOp\u00e9ra Nouvel (1831), renovated in 1993 by Jean Nouvel;\nTh\u00e9\u00e2tre des C\u00e9lestins (1877), designed by Gaspard Andr\u00e9;\nBasilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\u00e8re, large 19th-century basilica on the top of Fourvi\u00e8re Hill;\nTour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re (1894);\nLa Mouche Cattle Market and Abbatoir (1914, 1928), designed by Tony Garnier;\nSainte Marie de La Tourette monastery (1960) designed by Le Corbusier;\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry International Airport (formerly Satolas Airport), designed by Guillaume Gilbert;\nGare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1994) by Santiago Calatrava;\nPalais des congr\u00e8s de Lyon (1998), designed by Renzo Piano and a group of buildings for various functions;\nTour du Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais;\nTour Oxyg\u00e8ne;\nTour Incity.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Lyon (Fine Arts Museum), main museum of the city and one of the largest art galleries in France. Housed in the \"Palais Saint Pierre\", a former 17th-century convent, it displays a major collection of paintings by artists (including Tintoretto; Paolo Veronese; Nicolas Poussin; Rubens; Rembrandt; Zurbaran; Canaletto; Delacroix; Monet; Gauguin; Van Gogh; C\u00e9zanne; Matisse; Picasso; Francis Bacon...); collections of sculptures, drawings and printings, decorative arts, Roman and Greek antiquities; the second largest collection of Egyptian antiquities in France after that of the Louvre; and a medal cabinet of 50.000 medals and coins.\nThe Gallo-Roman Museum displaying many valuable objects and artworks found on the site of Roman Lyon (Lugdunum) such as Circus Games Mosaic, Coligny calendar and the Taurobolic Altar;\nCentre d'histoire de la r\u00e9sistance et de la d\u00e9portation;\nMus\u00e9e des Confluences, new museum of sciences and anthropology which opened its doors on 20 December 2014.\nLa Sucri\u00e8re, contemporary art centre;\nH\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon houses the \"Mus\u00e9e des Hospices Civils\", a permanent exhibit tracing the history and practice of medicine from the Middle Ages to modern times;\nMus\u00e9e des Tissus et des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, decorative arts and textile museum.

Located in the 6th arrondissement, it features a large lake on which boating takes place during the summer months.\nJardin botanique de Lyon (8 hectares), included in the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or, is a municipal botanical garden and is open weekdays without charge. The garden was established in 1857 as a successor to earlier botanical gardens dating to 1796, and now describes itself as France's largest municipal botanical garden.\nParc de Gerland, in the south of the city (80 hectares);\nParc des hauteurs, in Fourvi\u00e8res;\nParc de Miribel-Jonage (2200 hectares);\nParc de Lacroix-Laval (115 hectares);\nParc de Parilly (178 hectares).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe GDP of Lyon was 74 billion euro in 2012, making it the second richest city in France after Paris. Lyon and its region Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes represent one of the most important economies in Europe and, according to Loughborough University, can be compared to Philadelphia, Mumbai or Athens with regard to its international position. The city of Lyon is working in partnership to more easily enable the establishment of new headquarters in the territory (ADERLY, Chambre du commerce et d'industrie, Grand Lyon...). High-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development, video game (Arkane Studios, Ivory Tower, Eden Games, EA France, Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe), and internet services are also growing. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities. Lyon is home to the P4-Inserm\u2013ean Merieux Laboratory which conducts top-level vaccine research.The city is home to the headquarters of many large companies such as Groupe SEB, Sanofi Pasteur, Renault Trucks, Norbert Dentressangle, LCL S.A., Descours & Cabaud, Merial, Point S, BioM\u00e9rieux, Iveco Bus, Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne, GL Events, April Group, Boiron, Feu Vert, Panzani, Babolat, Euronews, Lyon Airports, LVL Medical, and inter-governmental agencies IARC, Interpol.\nThe specialisation of some sectors of activities has led to the creation of many main business centres:\nLa Part-Dieu, located in the 3rd arrondissement is the second biggest business quarter after La D\u00e9fense in Paris with over 1,600,000 m2 (17,222,256.67 sq ft) of office space and services and more than 55,000 jobs. Cit\u00e9 Internationale, created by the architect Renzo Piano is located in the border of the Parc de la T\u00eate d'Or in the 6th arrondissement. The worldwide headquarters of Interpol is located there. The district of Confluence, in the south of the historic centre, is a new pole of economical and cultural development.\nTourism is an important part of the Lyon economy, with one billion euros in 2007 and 3.5 million hotel-nights in 2006 provided by non-residents. Approximately 60% of tourists visit for business, with the rest for leisure. In January 2009, Lyon ranked first in France for hostels business. The festivals most important for attracting tourists are the F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res, the Nuits de Fourvi\u00e8re every summer, the Biennale d'art contemporain and the Nuits Sonores.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSince the Middle Ages, the region residents have spoken several dialects of Franco-Proven\u00e7al. The Lyonnais dialect was replaced by the French language as the importance of the city grew. However some \"frenchified\" Franco-Proven\u00e7al words can also be heard in the French of the Lyonnais, who call their little boys and girls \"gones\" and \"fenottes\" for example.\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers pioneered cinema in the town in 1895. The Institut Lumi\u00e8re, built as Auguste Lumiere's house, and a fascinating piece of architecture in its own right, holds many of their first inventions and other early cinematic and photographic artifacts.\n8 December each year is marked by the Festival of Lights (la F\u00eate des lumi\u00e8res), a celebration of thanks to the Virgin Mary, who purportedly saved the city from a deadly plague in the Middle Ages. During the event, the local population places candles (lumignons) at their windows and the city of Lyon organizes impressive large-scale light shows onto the sides of important Lyonnais monuments, such as the medieval Cath\u00e9drale St-Jean.\nThe Saint Francis of Sales church is famous for its large and unaltered Cavaill\u00e9-Coll pipe organ, attracting audiences from around the world.\nThe Op\u00e9ra Nouvel (New Opera House) is the home of the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon. The original opera house was re-designed by the distinguished French architect Jean Nouvel between 1985 and 1993 and is named after him.\nLyon is also the French capital of \"trompe l'\u0153il\" walls, a very ancient tradition. Many are to be seen around the city. This old tradition is now finding a contemporary expression, for example in the art of Guillaume Bottazzi.\nThe Brothers of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic congregation that operates schools in Europe and North America, was founded in Lyon in 1821.\nThe African Museum of Lyon is one of the oldest museums situated in Lyon.\nThe Museum of Resistance and Deportation looks at the various individuals prominent in the Resistance movement in World War II. The building is strongly linked to Klaus Barbie. Lyon sees itself as the center of the French resistance and many members were shot in Place Bellecour in the town center. The exhibition is largely a series of mini-biographies of those involved.\nThe unusual project Lyon Dubai City, a reproduction of some districts of Lyon in Dubai, is a major point for tourism in Lyon.\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission Intercultural cities program.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===\nThe Historic Site of Lyon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998. In its designation, UNESCO cited the \"exceptional testimony to the continuity of urban settlement over more than two millennia on a site of great commercial and strategic significance.\" The specific regions comprising the Historic Site include the Roman district and Fourvi\u00e8re, the Renaissance district (Vieux Lyon), the silk district (slopes of Croix-Rousse), and the Presqu'\u00eele, which features architecture from the 12th century to modern times.\nBoth Vieux Lyon and the slopes of Croix-Rousse are known for their narrow passageways (named traboules) that pass through buildings and link streets on either side. The first examples of traboules are thought to have been built in Lyon in the 4th century. The traboules allowed the inhabitants to get from their homes to the Sa\u00f4ne quickly and allowed the canuts on the Croix-Rousse hill to get from their workshops to the textile merchants at the foot of the hill.\n\n\n=== Gastronomy ===\n\nLyon has a long and chronicled culinary arts tradition. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.  Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.The bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.  Another Lyon tradition is a type of brunch food called \"m\u00e2chons\", made of local charcuterie and usually accompanied by Beaujolais red wine. M\u00e2chons were the customary meal of the canuts, the city's silk workers, who ate a late-morning meal after they finished their shifts in the factories.Other traditional local dishes include coq au vin; quenelle; gras double; salade lyonnaise (lettuce with bacon, cro\u00fbtons and a poached egg); and the sausage-based rosette lyonnaise and andouillette. Popular local confections include marron glac\u00e9 and coussin de Lyon. Cervelle de canut (literally, \"silk worker's brains\") is a cheese spread/dip made of a base of fromage blanc, seasoned with chopped herbs, shallots, salt, pepper, olive oil and vinegar.\nMore recently, the french tacos was invented in Lyon suburbs in the early 2000s and is now worldwide famous.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nLyon is home to the football club Olympique Lyonnais (OL), whose men's team plays in Ligue 1 and has won the championship of that competition seven times, all consecutively from 2002 to 2008). OL played until December 2015 at the 43,000-seat Stade de Gerland, which also hosted matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.  Since 2016, the team has played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, a 59,000-seat stadium located in the eastern suburb of D\u00e9cines-Charpieu. OL operates a women's team, Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, which competes in and dominates Division 1 F\u00e9minine. They are on a streak of 13 top-flight championships (2007\u2013present), and additionally claim the four titles won by the original incarnation of FC Lyon, a women's football club that merged into OL in 2004 (the current FC Lyon was founded in 2009). The OL women have also won the UEFA Women's Champions League six times, including the two most recent editions in 2018 and 2019. Lyon will host the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Semi-Finals as well as the 7 July Final at Stade de Lyon.\nLyon has a rugby union team, Lyon OU, in the Top 14, which moved into Stade de Gerland full-time in 2017\u201318. In addition, Lyon has a rugby league side called Lyon Villeurbanne that plays in the French rugby league championship. The club's home is the Stade Georges Lyvet in Villeurbanne.\nLyon is also home to the Lyon Hockey Club, an ice hockey team that competes in France's national ice hockey league. The Patinoire Charlemagne is the seat of Club des Sports de Glace de Lyon, the club of Olympic ice dancing champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and world champions Isabelle Delobel and Olivier Shoenfelder. Lyon-Villeurbanne also has a basketball team, ASVEL, that plays at the Astroballe arena.\n\n\n=== Street art ===\nSince 2000, Birdy Kids, a group of graffiti artists from the city, has decorated several random buildings and walls along the Lyon ring road. In 2012, the artist collective has been chosen to represent the city as its cultural ambassadors.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of the city of Lyon proper was 491,268 at the January 2011 census, 14% of whom were born outside Metropolitan France.\n \n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and tertiary education ===\n\n\u00c9cole Centrale de Lyon;\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon\nEM Lyon (\u00c9cole de Management de Lyon);\nECE Lyon (\u00c9cole de Commerce Europ\u00e9enne de Lyon);\nInstitut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Lyon (Sciences Po Lyon);\nCPE Lyon;\nECAM Lyon (\u00c9cole Catholique d'Arts et M\u00e9tiers de Lyon);\nEPITECH;\nEPITA;\nENTPE (\u00c9cole Nationale des Travaux Publiques de l'\u00c9tat);\nESME-Sudria;\n\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts;\nE-Artsup;\nINSA Lyon (Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon);\nPolytech Lyon;\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group;\nISARA (Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Agriculture Rh\u00f4ne Alpes);\nInstitution des Chartreux;\nInstitut polytechnique des sciences avanc\u00e9es;\nUniversit\u00e9 Claude Bernard (Lyon 1);\nUniversit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re (Lyon 2);\nUniversit\u00e9 Jean Moulin (Lyon 3);\nIAE (Institut d'Administration des Entreprises de Lyon);\nInstitut Sup'Biotech de Paris;\nCatholic University of Lyon;\nESDES Business School;\nIDRAC (International School of Management);\nWesford Graduate Business School;\nIFAG (Business Management School);\nInstitut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action;\nLe Lyc\u00e9e du Parc;\nLa Martiniere Lyon;\nWeb@cademie;\nCEESO (Centre Europ\u00e9en d'Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur de l'Ost\u00e9opathie);\nBellecour, Ecoles D'Arts.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThere are some international private schools in the Lyon area, including:\n\nCit\u00e9 Scolaire Internationale de Lyon or the Lyc\u00e9e de Gerland;\nIncludes the Section Japonaises (\u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Jeruran Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d \"Lyon Gerland Japanese Supplementary School\"), which the Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT) counts as a part-time Japanese supplementary school\nOmbrosa;\nInternational School of Lyon in nearby Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon;\nMontessori School of Lyon.\n\n\n=== Supplementary education ===\nOther Japanese supplementary schools:\n\nThe Association Pour le Developpement de la Langue et de la Culture Japonaises (ADLCJ; \u30ea\u30e8\u30f3\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 Riyon Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d) is held in the Maison Berty Albrecht in Villeurbanne, near Lyon. It was formed in 1987. It serves Japanese expatriate children who wish to continue their Japanese education whilst abroad.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport, located east of Lyon, serves as a base for domestic and international flights. It is a key transport facility for the entire Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, with coach links to other cities in the area. The in-house train station Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry connects the airport to the nationwide TGV network. The Rh\u00f4nexpress tram monopoly links the airport with the business quarter of La Part Dieu in less than 30 minutes, and offers connections with Underground A & B, Tramway T1, T3 & T4, and bus lines. Lyon public transport Sytral offers a bus service, Route 47, that links the airport to Meyzieu where passengers can change onto Tram T3. The regular price of public transport is \u20ac1.90, as opposed to \u20ac15 one way for the Rhonexpress. In the suburb of Bron, the smaller Lyon-Bron Airport provides an alternative for domestic aviation.\nLyon has two major railway stations: Lyon Part-Dieu, which was built to accommodate the TGV, and Lyon Perrache, an older station that now provides mostly regional service. Smaller railway stations include Gorge-de-Loup, Vaise, V\u00e9nissieux, Saint-Paul and Jean Mac\u00e9. Lyon was the first city to be connected to Paris by the TGV in 1981. Since that time the TGV train network has expanded and links Lyon directly to Perpignan, Toulouse, Nice, Marseille, Strasbourg, Nantes and Lille. International trains operate directly to Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Turin, Geneva, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Brussels and London.\nThe city is at the heart of a dense road network and is located at the meeting point of several highways: A6 (to Paris); A7 (to Marseille); A42 (to Geneva); and A43 (to Grenoble). The city is now bypassed by the A46. A double motorway tunnel passes under Fourvi\u00e8re, connecting the A6 and the A7 autoroutes, both forming the \"Autoroute du Soleil\".\nLyon is served by the Eurolines intercity coach organisation. Its Lyon terminal is located at the city's Perrache railway station, which serves as an intermodal transportation hub for tramways, local and regional trains and buses, the terminus of Metro line A, of the Tramway T2, the bicycle service V\u00e9lo'v, and taxis.\n\nThe Transports en commun lyonnais (TCL), Lyon's public transit system, consisting of metro, tramways and buses, serves 62 communes of the Lyon metropolis. The metro network has four lines ( A   B   C   D ), 42 stations, and runs with a frequency of up to a train every 2 minutes. There are five Lyon tram lines ( T1  T2  T3  T4  T5) since April 2009: T1 from Debourg in the south to IUT-Feyssine in the north, Tram T2 from Perrache railway station to Saint-Priest in the south-east, Tram T3 from Part-Dieu to Meyzieu, Tram T4 from 'H\u00f4ptial Feyzin Venissieux' to Gaston Berger. Tram T5 from Grange Blanche, in the south-east to Eurexpo in the south-wast. The Lyon bus network consists of the Lyon trolleybus system, motorbuses, and coaches for areas outside the centre. There are also two funicular lines from Vieux Lyon to Saint-Just and Fourvi\u00e8re. The ticketing system is relatively simple as the city has only one public transport operator, the SYTRAL.\nThe public transit system has been complemented since 2005 by V\u00e9lo'v, a bicycle network providing a low-cost service where bicycles can be hired and returned at any of 340 stations throughout the city.  Borrowing a bicycle for less than 30 minutes is free. Free rental time can be extended for another 30 minutes at any station. Lyon was the first city in France to introduce this bicycle renting system. In 2011 the Auto'lib car rental service was introduced; it works much the same way as the Velo'v but for cars.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lyon on a weekday is 45 minutes. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 min, while 17% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.7 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== International relations ==\nLyon is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European Commission \"Intercultural cities\" program.\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\n\nLyon is twinned with:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGallia Lugdunensis\nList of movies set in Lyon\nList of people from Lyon\nList of streets and squares in Lyon\nM\u00e8res of France\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website(in French)\nVisit Lyon, the official website for tourism in France\nLyon Tourist Office and Convention Bureau\nLyon\u2019s English Language News and Information",

          "large space with some attractions \u00e0 la Jules Verne. Moderately interesting. the place to go with kids 5-15.",
          "This was just wonderful. We did the elephant ride, the carousel and the gallery where the new animals are being demonstrated -- and bought the t-shirt. Worth a trip to Nantes just for this. And actually one of the reasons I chose Nantes for a side trip from our month long",
          "This attaction is really good value and just so spectacular to see. Highly recommend it. When 5he staff do the demos of the machines it's actually quite unbelievable. 5 stars.",
          "I thought that the expo of the machines was very nicely done, only downside is that all the demonstrations are voiced over by the guide(s) and this is only in French. Well it's France so they expect you to speak french......however some of the boards in the exposition hall are",
          "Strolled to here from the city centre as we had read loads of great reviews. We were disappointed as the tours were all booked up for that afternoon, definitely pre book in advance. Walked around in the 31 degrees heat and got to see the amazing elephant. Definitely worth a see",
          "Les Machines de L'ile (The Machines of the Isle of Nantes) is a whimsical world. Inspired by the wildly imaginative works of writer Jules Verne\u2014 born in Nantes in 1828\u2014the park is an artistic wonderland of massive puppet and automaton machines. It is built in the covered",
          "At first impressions it is just a big open space, lots of concrete and lots of trip hazards - beware. The main building has the machine galleries and it houses THE ELEPHANT. This is just an incredible piece of Engineering It must have been a sight in the past when it was totally",
          "Visited this morning , disappointingly the merry go round was nit open till 2pm. The Galerie was fantastic, such a huge endeavour. Very enjoyable.",
          "Incredible machines... certainly worthy of a visit. Price to get in for adults - worth every penny. Looking forward to the opening of the Machine des Iles tourist attraction in 2022.",
          "A 'must see' if staying anywhere close to Nantes. You would pay five times the 8 Euro entrance charge, back in the UK. Star of the show is a ride on the 4 -story high mechanical elephant. A fascinating preview of the progress towards 'The City in the Sky' when all of the",
          "It's a Steampunk vision of a zoo. These phenomenal machines replicate the actual motion of the animals they represent. The descriptions and guided tour is all in French, but you don't need to understand the language to enjoy the display. Plan for about an hour for the gallery",

          "Where else in the whole world will you find an attraction featuring high-tech robotics and a giant mechanical elephant? Nowhere but here in the Machines de L'ile des Nantes! With the Nantes Pass (25 Euros for 24 hours, 35 for 48 hours), you can choose to enter the gallery for",
          "The exhibits that are on display today are only a tease of what is to come in the next few years. If you are interested in machines this is a great place. The park is also filled with actives for families.",
          "The kids and adults are still talking about their day here six months after the fact\u2014unbelievable. Incredible machines to ride and view. Wow.......wow.....wow....",
          "We visited all the machines. The gallery was very interesting, but more information in English would be helpful. Later we took a ride on the elephant, in was really funny. At the end, we visited the carousel and took a ride on the horses. This place was cool and innovative. A",
          "All ages will enjoy a visit here, to watch and see, the various machines in motion. Well worth a visit. Recommended",
          "This place is so cool! and I'm a 30-something-years-old woman... the mechanic elephant is so cool- you have to visit there.",
          "We came here on a Saturday morning for it opening at 10am as we had not booked it in advance spaces fill up fast with group bookings and it only comes out 3 times a day",
          "A must to visit even just to see the elephant. Excellent staff and gift shop. Amazing facilities in this unique building.",
          "The machines are a highlight of Nantes, you must visit. Be aware you can buy advance tickets online only for the first elephant ride of the day at 10:15am. This is well worth it as the lines are long and the ride itself takes 40 minutes. Your elephant ticket also allows",
          "Great thing to do when in Nantes. Really interesting to watch the mechanics of the animals. Great messages about saving the animals as welk. Arrive early so you can ride the elephant",
          "We missed the elephant when it came to London so were looking forward to seeing it in Nantes. We were put off by the huge queue but were lucky enough to arrive as the elephant was leaving the shed. It is an amazing feat of engineering and we got to see it in action for free.",
          "The machines are wonderful, such creative things are worth stopping by to check. However, the line is always huge and quite stressful.",
          "Sloths, prehistoric birds, giant spiders, all mechanized for viewers to see. One visitor was even invited to ride a giant inchworm. Children will love it as will adults.",
          "A great display of mechanical animals that are operated during the visit. You just wander around looking at the exhibits and listen for when the exhibits are coming to life. The mechanical elephant is amazing. Cost is reasonable but there is a lot of queuing involved as they",
          "In a world full of practical things, this unique place belongs to the worlds of dreams. You'll be able to see gigantic mechanical spider together with huge mechanical ants and other amazing mechanical creatures. This place is great for children and children in their hart! Don't",
          "Such a wonderful unique place to visit, literally the dream of two men come to life, and on such a grand scale. We visited on a Saturday and arrived at about 10.30 when there were only a few people in the queue. An hour later however the queue was long and slow moving so either",
          "Highly recommended . Unique place, especially Grant Elephant. only a few tours a day but definitely worth it, there is a line to buy the ticket, so plan your time before. Carousel is also very interesting.",

          "As my wife does not speak French, we passed on most of the (undoubtedly) interesting tour of most of the animal machines. but we did opt for a ride on the elephant. This is a unique experience lasting about 30 minutes when you can \"ride\" the elephant from the carousel to the",
          "On an Isle in the Loire River in Nantes, France; there is an enchanted Jules Verne (Nantes is his birthplace) themed carousel! These delightful mechanical sea creatures are animated with the help of their human passengers. We enjoyed watching each of the three levels and even",
          "The museum is somewhat confusing as the 'machines' part and then the elephant ride are priced differently (there is a separate but related carousel). The machines was all in French and somewhat interesting but not worth the admission. The elephant ride was fun and my kids",
          "Well worth a visit to see the spectacular machines already made, those in planning stages and more in production. You can even ride on some of them!",
          "We visited Les Machines on a sunny Sunday afternoon. We waited for over an hour in a very long, slow moving line. Once we were closer to the ticket area we could see the sign showing how many tickets were available to ride the elephant. And clearly there were way more people in",
          "This place is everything we had hoped it would be although we got there at 10 and at no time were told it doesn\u2019t open until 2 out of season. So be warned, don\u2019t get there until at least 1.30 and queue for the Elephant ride first as this sells out very quickly. You won\u2019t be",
          "This is quite a lively place especially during the weekend and even more so when it\u2019s sunny. The giants are the main attractions but the large area has some interesting parts as well. Floating restaurant, Jules Verne\u2019s looking merry-go-round, live music, etc Nice atmosphere.",
          "To people who like engineering it is a perfect place to visit! The machines use shapes of nature and they move alike so it is very interesting place to watch the prototypes",
          "I had the privilege of visiting Les Machines de Nantes last summer, one of the first places of interest which I saw outside of Paris. There was quite a wait to enter the main showroom since the previous group had not yet finished, so we were in line for a while. However,",
          "Because of refurbishment, no left luggage at the station. Walked 35mins to the exhibition, waited 30 mins in the slowest queue ever, get to the entrance \u2018no bags!!!??. No where to leave bags!!!??. It was a small bag!! Useless morons, the elephants could run it better!!!",
          "The exhibition, the elephant, the caroussel...all very beautiful and nice to see. But my word I have never seen such an ineffici\u00ebnt system anywhere. Tickets are sold from 2pm onwards and eventhough we arrived a half hour before. We still had to wait until 3pm before we could buy",
          "Wow what an exceptional place. The work and attention to detail is unbelievable. The staff were knowledgeable, funny and polite. The experience is one of a kind. You simply can't visite Nantes without riding on the elephant ! Oh and the shop is well worth a visite too !",
          "An attraction that you don\u2019t see everywhere, worth the visit! Parking and access is easy, the access to see the elephant, the carousel and the tree climbing (arbre des h\u00e9rons) is free, we only paid for the gallery visit.",
          "Unic in the world.... who ever goes to Nantes has to go visite les machines de Nantes. Absolutely awesome, gorgeous, very smart.",
          "The Gallery\u2019s workers were behaving extreamly unprofessionally and unfair, they let you try on the machines, but they choose who will go on randomly, so they were doing the heron flight and asked for volunteers, my children asked if they can go, but were told they are too small",
          "I visited the museum where the were demonstrations of the rideable animals (in French). The mechanics of how each beast moves is truly fascinating and beautiful. The video opposite the museum, and overlooking the workshop was very good too. Very impressive indeed.",
          "This visit made my trip. I had a great time and even rode some of the machines. It,s not just for kids, people of all ages will be hypnotise by the various machines. You will need 2-3 hours to enjoy this great attraction. I was able to ride the giant mechanical elephant and a",
          "Didn\u2019t really know what to expect as taken along by local friends..... totally enthralled by the sheer craziness of the whole enterprise...... Jules Verne meets Victorian steam punk.. Brilliant!! Only in France would something like this happen, praise be!",
          "My husband and I loved this place . Seeing the machines in action and seeing the vision for the Tree was wonderful . I cannot wait to come back when it\u2019s done ! They would benefit from providing some material in English , especially when explaining how each of the machines work",
          "Wanted to do this with my girls for a few years, elephant is amazing and goes very slowly for about 40 mins. We all got splashed!! Had to wait about 5 hrs to get a go but had a look around the area, played at the playground and had lunch. Glad we did it but would not go back.",
          "I'm sorry but we didn't really get the concept of this attraction. The park was fine but the mechanical Animals rather left us cold. Maybe it would have been better if the centre piece, the mechanical elephant, had been there but there was no sign of it. All in all rather",
          "This was a fascinating visit for us, it was only slightly spoilt by the fact we couldn't understand a word they were saying, all of the commentary was in French (obviously) and most if not all the information around was also in French. This was really unsurprising, and I cannot",
          "This has to be the most amazing place I've ever been! Steampunk Heaven! Not a cheap place to visit and worth checking that the things you want to see are working as they have maintenance days (the website has full details). Staff spoke good English though all the talks are in",
          "We had a fabulous morning exploring the galley and of course have a ride of the famous Elephant which is a must. The animal in the galley were also amazing and were ridden. In the galley the descriptions were in French but words did not add much to the spectacular sights. \u00a317",
          "OK let\u2019s be clear, the guide is only in French, as are the descriptions, but it\u2019s a unique way to while away an hour in a re- purposed shipyard. The amazing elephant was receiving maintenance when we were there, but looks like a blast - especially for kids. We looked at the",
          "Amazing-very interactive with so many extraordinary machines. We loved the spider and the hummingbird especially although the elephant is brilliant, astonishing and well worth the money to ride on. You will simply never see anything like this anywhere else. Maybe the carousel is",
          "Every time we are in Nantes, we make sure to go and see the elephant as it is simply a marvel of engineering. Children of all ages just love it! They travel just in front of it as it goes on its tour of the area and hope to be sprayed by the regular squirts of water from its",
          "They were large and fully automated, Take the chance to ride in - on them and become part of the machine, comantary is in french as you wuld expect but the staff do speak english",
          "From an abandoned shipyard to the creation of fantastic machines. You will not only see the current ones, but they will also share with you their dreams and next projects. Don\u2019t miss the elephant!",
          "Les machines is good for all the family and reasonably good value. The story behind the regeneration of the area is interesting and the ride on the elephant and carousel are good. Arrive early if you want to get a ride on the elephant as this books up - only 50 people are",
          "Just outside the centre a couple of tram stops down. Even if you do not go on the rides its a nice place to walk round. You will need to pay though to ride on the elephant and to enter the gallery of machines, the queues can get long to buy the tickets, it was August when we",
          "Wow. This place is amazing, quirky, entertaining and so well executed. The elephant is utterly brilliant. We loved the spider and hummingbird too. Brilliant!",
          "We bought a 72 hour city pass and the art gallery was included but just had to pay extra to ride on the elephant! The elephant was soooo big!!! Kept squirting water out unexpectedly haha. Got drenched at one point.",
          "Just watching these giants move around is fascinating so we didn\u2019t buy a tichet to ride on one. That seems a bit steep (8 Euro) but the money for the tickets does go to animal welfare sanctuaries. Worth the small detour from the crowds in the centre of the city.",
          "Turned up at Les Machines not really knowing what to expect and was greeted by the noise of an elephant from around the corner. To say I was surprised with what I saw would be an understatement when this huge elephant, a combination of metal and wood, cross my path spraying",
          "This was recommended to us and I was a little \"meh\" based on the leaflets, but we walked by and bought tickets and it was one of the highlights of our trip. These are steampunk machines in the shape of animals and plants and the highlight is a 6o ton walking elephant that 50",
          "We were only in Nantes for one day so didn\u2019t get to spend too much time at Le Voyage a Nantes. However, I would definitely return to see it properly. Based slightly outside of the centre, it is a former naval shipyard which has been turned into this amazing attraction. It",
          "Nice place and their machines are incredible work. We did not find any tours done in english at the time of our visit.. so we did not get the full impression of the place.",
          "Machine of the isle of Nantes: Les machines de l'\u00eele - is really funny, of course how it mechanically works is not funny but rather quite complex. It is made as realistic as possible to match a natural elephant. The trip is very short, but with kids it is always fun!",
          "Brilliant, wacky and inspiring and truly inspiring. A ride and a soaking by the elephant is a must. The thinking and design is first class as is the presentation. The future projects make this a visit to return to. The cafe to the north of the site is a good lunch stop off.",
          "Amazing place. Unlike anything you've ever experienced. Innovative and inspiring. However no option to have a tour in English, my conversational French not up to the mark.",
          "Did not have enough time to be worth paying admission, but worth going by to see the Oliphant take a walk and spray the spectators/passengers on a hot day.",
          "We took our four kids under 11 to see the Machines de L\u2019Ile on a hot Saturday afternoon in August. The queue was so long that we ended up making do with the carousels and seeing the amazing robotic elephant. The kids really enjoyed seeing the elephant tramping along spraying",
          "This is really something that is not easy to find anywhere else. I understood that this was created to revitalize Nantes\u2019 shipyards. The Elephant is really nice even if I have to say that apart from wetting the passers-by with a jet of water from the proboscis and having a short",

          "We chose to visit the gallery rather than ride the elephant because most of the timings were fully booked so would recommend pre-booking if that's something you're desperate to do. Fascinating and relatively new attraction. Also nice restaurant across the way, decently priced",
          "We visited the carousel after standing in line for about an hour for the elephant ride to discover that it was sold out for the day. It seems from other reviews on here that you can book ahead but staff on site told us this was not possible and you needed to arrive onsite by",
          "Nantes is a wonderful City, and following the green line round takes you from site to site. There are some great art installations and a highlight is the elephant at les machines d\u2019ile. The carousel there is amazing. Follow as much as possible as there are delights all the way",
          "We had the best time, we pre booked our ride on the elephant so didn't have to que for that. Was a great experience, we also enjoyed watching the elephant on its travels around the site. We also visited the gallerie. Very interesting, we couldn't understand the presentations as",
          "Really nice expo for young and old; the huge elephant is undoubtedly a must-see in Nantes. The 'Les machines de L'Ile' is part of the 'Voyage a Nantes' (Travel) and offers a mix of different works of art. Different animals are being shown and the large building offer a variety",
          "Where imagination becomes reality but but but awful queues to get tickets for the gallery (where they give a guided hands on tour) it took us over 2 hours. If you have children this is a nightmare. The operators really must address this.",
          "We loved the Elephant ride, great guide who was fun., a very interesting place. If you want to do the ride or the exhibition I would book in advance as there was no queue if you had booked but a very very long queue to buy tickets.",
          "Although we didn\u2019t go on the elephant, the queue was massive, it didn\u2019t stop the enjoyment. In fact the kids dodging the regular blasts of water from the elephant\u2019s trunk was their highlight.",
          "We headed to Nantes nice and early, excited by the great views. Unfortunately what we had not realised was that people queue from before it opens and we were faced with a 2 hour wait (according to the information girl). We decided against it as we realised that we would only get",
          "Amazing display of incredible machines in a mix of Jules Verne and Da Vinci. It's very interesting for the people of all ages. We bought the tickets at the counter there but I would advise buying in advance, if you don't want to queue for at least 30 minutes. The staff operates",
          "Worth the visit just to see the Elephant, what a feat of engineering. We did not ride on it but just watching the way this mechanical beast walked it looked just like the real thing. Do not miss this if you visit Nantes.",
          "Be prepared to wait to buy your tickets or book in advance if you can get there in time for the first 2 ridesf the day, but it was a great experience.",
          "Visit this museum, located on the banks of the Loire, and wonder at the many automated machines from small sea prawns to the giant 12 metre high elephant, taking up to 50 people for a ride. Wander round the galleries, take part in a workshop, discover a world of machines and do",
          "It's a remarkable experience, and was the high point (in more than one sense) of our holiday in this beautiful city.",
          "Mind-blowing for any steam punk enthusiast, but excellent for everybody else, too. The place itself was visually very pleasing and modern, lots of plants. We took the tour where staff presented the machines, and our 5 yr old got to ride one. We saw the Elephant but did not ride",
          "The place is amazing, you only pay if you want to go in or rid on. You can just wonder around watching the elephant walk around the park.",
          "We had seen some brochures and this place and visited it for a quick trip. We were amazed by the technology and engineering involved. A great day out for every one . The elephant ride was thoroughly enjoyable.. Would has liked to get the kids to the front when things were being",
          "This is simple. Nantes is a city where you can't find all the entertainment in one place, you need to walk and discover the city step by step and is there that you will enjoy and be amazed of all the things the city as to offer you and the Machines de L'Ile is one of them. I'm",
          "If you are near to Nantes, you have to go here. Unbelievable feats of engineering and creativity. It's sad to see some negative comments about no English translation, I speak no French but you just have to use your imagination, it's fairly easy really. The elephant ride was as",

          "We visited hoping to see and touch the machines. Hosted inside a greenhouse with crowds. Not much to see, machines are impressive but slow and you are herded like sheep to watch the demonstrations. May be interesting once the tree concept has been developed but at the moment",
          "If Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci had a love child this place would be it! The engineering and craftsmanship of the machines these guys have created and their overall vision for future creations is spectacular. Can't wait to return in 2020 when their dream is fulfilled.",
          "This place was the old place were they biuld the boats. Its between to arms of the river and they use it as a \"tribute\" to Jules Verne. We saw the elephant and decided to have a trip (8,5\u20ac) that takes like 25-30 minutes. The amchine is amazing and in summer hot days, the trunk",
          "We visited hoping to see and touch the machines. But essentially it's more like a show with select audience participation. Hosted inside a greenhouse with crowds that will block the view and interrupt videos and photos. Not much to see, machines are impressive but slow and you",
          "We saw one of the \"animals\" at the Bay Area Maker Faire so we had to go to the source and it did not disappoint. What was supposed to be a one day affair ended up being a total of four unforgettable days. Playing with the spraying elephant might have been even more fun than",
          "This is art in an area of urban regeneration. It is ever evolving as people work on new pieces in the workshop in the centre of the reclaimed warehouse, and it's also great fun. Working mechanical animals move around the gallery during the tour, which takes about an hour (mostly",

          "I had no idea what to expect and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Unfortunately the elephant was not out walking, but the Gallerie des Machines and the Carousel des Marins were brilliant. With a Nantes Pass you get one ride included and a reduction on the second.",

          "The elephant ride was fantastic, our host brilliant even if I didn\u2019t understand all he said not having had a decent French education. The machines were brilliant but the smallish exhibition only displayed a few, having said that the spider was awesome. Shop was good with some",
          "Had limited time in Nantes and decided that we had to see this place. We paid and entered to discover that a tour of the exhibits had just started. It was all in French and there were loads of children there. It was great to see them enjoying the machines. I was struck by the",

          "So the elephant ride is unmissable. the website appears to only take bookings on saturday and sunday (what a genius idea!) so you have to just show up on a friday and roll the dice. We got lucky with a 3pm ride. It was 1130am, so we went into town to get a sandwich - probably a",
          "Great even for big kids! The lumbering mechanical elephant seems surreal lumbering alone squealing and squirting water. The young ones seemed totally entranced. You can pay to ride but it\u2019s just as much fun to watch from the sidelines.",
          "This is a must-see if you are in Nantes, with our without offspring. it's fun, educational aand although the commentary is completely in French that did not matter, you get the idea. it's hectic if you happen to be there at the same time as a school trip but it's not the end of",

          "WOW! Les Machines De Lile in Nantes, France is fantastic. In 2022 a metal tree will be constructed in a disused quarry measuring 50m in diameter x 35m high. The pics here are prototypes of what will be placed in the tree. People will be able to ride the animals from branch to",
          "This is more a display of machanical animal shaped constructions that can move about and are large enough to ride on. The museum itself is overpriced as there's not much to see. However you can pay 8.50 euros and ride on the huge mechanical elephant which would be a novelty.",
          "Just go!!! See the elephant, see the heron and many of the insects which will inhabit the 45 metre Heron Tree when it eventually opens in 2022 - loved the spider and the caterpillar. BUT do not be put off by the exterior of the Carousel as my husband and I nearly were. It was",
          "Wellllllll have you ever seen anything else like it before? The only point that would make this cool attraction better is extending the hours. I would have loved to ride the elephant, as it's one of my favourite animals.",
          "We had an amazing time here. Watching the elephant was incredible but I didn't feel like I needed to wait in line to ride it. We did pay to ride the carousel which was awesome. It's so much better than it looks from the outside. I could have watched it for a long time. The",

          "After waiting nearly 10 years to visit I finally managed to ride the elephant and was not disappointed. I pestered my family for years about going but no one else wanted to go, finally this year they gave in and came, well everyone loved the trip and were equally amazed by the",

          "Only went to outside area and watched the giant elephant walk the street. We good and great to see. Was not really interested in going in to see rest of machines",
          "The elephant is the reason to go - I would recommend to call ahead to make sure the elephant is working except that no one seem available to answer their phones. The first day we got on the elephant, but the engine broke down so we were a no go. No problems getting a refund.",
          "Great adventure that stimulates the imagination. Ride the elephant and the carousel. We also highly recommend the gift shop. Allow three hours for your visit.",

          "Visiting Les Machines de L'Ile was one of the main reasons for travelling to Nantes and we were not disappointed. When the mechanical Grand Elephant lifts up its trunk and trumpets soulfully before slowly exiting the shed it is a near heart-stopping moment. I have never seen so",
          "Went here on the way back to England. Even though the elephant wasn't doing rides because of the weather -it was early March- we went on the giant carousel and my wife got to operate a giant mechanical caterpillar in the workshop. (It seems that instead of saying 'keep off the",
          "Very, very, very interesting attraction. I rarely see anything like that. It is like a Luna park, but with all machines. It is quite something I should say. This is definitively a must-see in Nantes.",
          "We rode the elephant and went in the gallery of the machines. I didn't realise in the gallery they would show you all of the machines moving. It was a real highlight of our trip.",
          "Very disappointed. Paid to enter and there was very little to see. Granted the elephant was gone for repair but aside from that it was still disappointing",
          "I like the elephant particularly, it is quite magical to see it walk and carry people, either from on high (from the magical tree) or by walking alongside it. You have to pay extra if you want to go on it. The other machines are interesting, especially the spider, the heron and",
          "This place has some of the fabulous folks working here and their work is just incredible! Some of their machines on display during our visit were an elephant, a dragon, a spider, a heron, a worm and an ant! The people over there were very kind and can speak in English as well,",
          "Only really worth visiting if the elephant is working. The rest of it is interesting and worth an hour or two but the elephant is the star.",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in the area. The machines created have the form of surreal animals and impress by their imagination. Great place for small & big children although it can get busy.",
          "Definitely sign up to ride the elephant! Our only complaint was the explanations for everything were only in French with very little English translations available.",
          "a magnificent man-made animal. You can cruise on its back and clearly all faces on board were overjoyed. You have to book in advance at certain times in the year, as places are restricted. Recommended especially if there ar young chidren in your party.",
          "I definitely enjoyed visiting this place, so many interesting animals and created created out of machinery and wood, so fascinating to watch them move. Amazing to see plans for the future as it is a site of experiment, research and fantasy. We could also look down from the",
          "Definitely the best of the Nantes public art Scene, Make sure to go there and wait to see all the outdoor robots. Mechanical elephant \"right out of \" Star War \" imagination. Fun for the whole family, couples or alone don't forget your video camera!!",
          "A bonkers universe of a mechanical world this is the warehouse where all magic happen and in some sort some kind of taster to what is going to be a wonderful and most probably internationally admired new clever themed park. The herons tree is opening in 2022 just outside Nantes",

          "This elephant is amazing! I loved it. It looks really cool and is made exclusively. You can see its parts and how it works. But is even better if you have a ride on it. The most funny thing is to watch the reactions of the people on the ground, while you are at the top. The",

          "Julia was disappointed that when cycling through Nantes on her way to Spain (as you do!) a couple of years ago, the Elephant was \"en panne\". We thought mid-week in November would be ideal for a brief tour of Brittany in our Elise, and we could include a ride on the Elephant.",
          "We weren't sure what we were going to see really but it ended up being pretty cool. A little bit expensive for the rides which we didn't bother with but the machines we saw were really cool. Make sure you see the elephant.",
          "We had a great time visiting the site and took a ride on the elephant which our boys loved (6 and 8). We also visited the Galerie, but would not recommend this, it is the same price as the elephant. A small number of people could go on the machines and you had to watch with",
          "Walk over the bridge over the River Loire to L'Ile nantes and there are Les machines de L'Ile nantes - the gallery, the wonderful 3 decker carousel and then a ride on the wonderful mechanised elephant of Nantes. Makes for a super day out!",
          "This is for both families and adults. Fascinating to see the different machines. Not really necessary to ride \"Le Grand Elephant\" as it moves around. You get better photographs of it from ground level.",

          "Went to this place and for a family of 3 including the elephant ride it was E48 so quite expensive. It was really busy and i think you can just go to part of the open area without paying. The place looks like an old factory and is now used for these machines. They are great and",
          "Went to see this attraction in Nantes but was disappointed. We thought we paid to see all of the attractions but were only admitted to the carousel. One free ride included but you had to ride on the lower level in conveyances that fit kids not adults. The carousel was impressive",

          "No other place in Europe will you see this - automated animal-machines, for a meditative experience - equally interesting for children and adults!",
          "Great place but they give you the idea that these are machines that do more than they actually do, that the giant spider crawls along as it carries people, that the great elephant walks, that the centipede crawls along a tree trunk. They are all giant puppets: the spider moves",
          "Different experience, organized by the ISMAR conference. The machines were very interesting and amazing built.",

          "What can I say. Absolutely unmissable and unbelievable. The highlight of a visit to Nantes. Nantes would be nothing without it.",
          "Fantastic day, really interesting to see, well worth the visit, will hopefully return in the future.",
          "I liked most the huge mechanical elephant. this in itself is a good reason to go there. the other mechanical animals are really impressive but i was disappointed to learn that they are operated only within the guided tour and with 1 or 2 of the guests in the tour. i had in mind",
          "This is a must the elephant was fav if you want you can go for a ride on it's back you have to see it & go for the tour to see all the other animals great half day outing.",
          "Great demonstrations of these complex machines well worth the visit. The elephant is especially good but be careful of the water from the trunk.",
          "Truly a unique place to visit in Nantes. The former Navy Yards have been converted into a modern industrial arts area rich with modern and interesting art/exhibits inspired by Jules Verne and Galileo. The merry-go-round, Grant Elephant, and other artworks are worth the time to",
          "If you are in Nantes, you should go there although you are not a child. We spend 2 charming and funny hours there. There are a lot of machines and exhibits, which really work. There is a guided tour (in French) and the staff show you, how the machines work. Most of them you can",

          "This is THE thing to do when in Nantes. We walked from our hotel in the centre of town, which must have taken around 20 minutes, crossing the bridge across the river. It's easy to get to and well signposted. We arrived before the opening time of 10am, so were fortunate enough",
          "The Elephant is fantastic and the whole concept is brilliant. We had a ride on the elephant which is good but you really should see it moving first to get any decent photos. The gallery is so worth a visit and the other exhibits are breathtaking.",
          "The 40 ton elephant ride worth the visit, but as it moved around the old shipyards, little to see. So much potential to do something in the Hugh concrete space, available. It was Sunday so we could not do the workshop tour, and we loved the mechanical elephant, but some",

          "I did book the ride on the elephant on line for almost 9 euros. This was an amazing experience to see this huge machine in action. Then I visited the workshop (included in the ride ticket). The museum was disappointing in size and very expensive (almost 9 euros). I didn't do the",
          "It was lucky that I bought a Nante city day pass so I entered the museum for free. It was a bit of a walk from the city centre and I only went there to see the Elephant. I don't really think is worth going in to the museum.",

          "Very pleased to see the elephant was actually in action - website implied only active on weekends. Cost of 8.50 Euros per adult for 30 minutes was very good value. I think I was more excited that the children on the ride. Thoroughly enjoyed this activity and cannot rate",

          "So I didn't know what to expect when we arrived here. There was a fairly long queue (45 minutes) to get tickets and then you have to buy all your tickets separately. So one for the Carousel, one for the elephant and one for the museum, essentially 3 separate attractions all on",
          "We were excited to visit this attraction thinking there was lots to do. However it was confusing to know where to go. We walked towards the carousel area. (Very spread out so lots of walking). We paid for carousel thinking it would send you off afterwards into more areas to",

          "It is situated on the island in Loir river. You can go on foot or by tram. It is not faraway. It is a spectacular park with a lot of works of engineering. Especially the elephant is superb. If the weather is good you can sit by the river and have a relax. Generally you will",
          "A mechanical elephant that adults can ride! It spouts out vapour from it's trunk as it moves along. A big hit with the adults and kids!",
          "We made a special point of visiting in Nantes in order to visit Les Machines de L'ile. Intending only to make a brief visit, we spent two days admiring the elephant, having a ride on the elephant, visiting the Galerie des Machines and the workshops. We also had a ride on the",

However we thought that it rated a must-see once we\u2019d read up on local attractions. Well, what to say: This organisation is, it must be",
          "This is a place not to be missed in Nantes, if only for its uniqueness. We rode the elephant, although it is just as much fun to march along next to it!",
          "These are not machines. They are animatronic sculptures. They run on rails and wheels. This is an arts project. If that's what you want/like & you benefit from perfect French then hopefully you won't mind the ticket price. Otherwise may I offer a word of caution. This place",
          "We have been to Nantes before but the Machines de L'Ile is a new attraction since our last visit. We researched when to go online as the carousel only opens certain times and certain days. It is also a little pricey at \u20ac8.90 per person for two rides on the Carousel and another",
          "Good visit with a few friends, great for all ages. Talks in both English and French which was great to see. The displays from the machines were impressive. The carousel was also interactive and was cheap to ride. The entire island is a work of art. The Grand Elephant was out of",
          "Do not miss it and make sure you ride the elephant and go on the carousel. Also buy a tourist pass for value for money",
          "We rode the famous mechanical elephant and visited the carousel as well. We all really enjoyed ourselves and even purchased a print to frame when we got back home. Some great bars and restaurants close by too.",
          "We decided to visit after seeing a BBC Travel report and we were very glad that we went. The machines are true works of art and engineering. The imagination that has gone into creating the machines is really fantastic. We are already planning to return when the giant tree has",

          "The machines show how man can use his imagination to develop and copy nature but not improve. A very impressive place to visit.",
          "Visited with my two young toddlers who loved the elephant and carousel. Awesome architecture in this part of Nantes too! The nearby moon trampoline park was a big hit with all the family.",
          "Wow. Just blew me away this place. The design. The incredibly cool machines, the sheer scale of things. Just incredible. I was blown away by the fun and the attention to detail. I have to visit again, didn't have time to see it all. So cool!! Highly recommended, try to go early,",
          "All the Machines are awesome!! It is impressive to see all the work behind them, starting from the amazing designs and finishing with the nice style. The spirit of Julio Verne can be felt behind all the machines! It deserves a visit!!!",
          "We came to Nantes to see this incredible exhibit This can only be described as part, museum, part science, and a lot of steampunk! Super cool! We rode on a 3 story mechanical elephant, watched young a boy ride an enormous centipede, and others fly on a giant bird, and ride",
          "Very disappointing and not worth the bother. Much better ways to spend your time in this beautiful city than going to see a mechanical elephant and the few other modest 'attractions' on offer here.",

          "The highlight of our trip to Normandy. We were staying at Carnac, which was nearly a two hour drive from Nantes, and we made the trip especially for les machines. It was worth it. For the ticket price you get an hour in the gallery and access to the workshop, as well as a",
          "Just in the town, on the old docks, all in french, but the elephant ,,,, crazy, plus the biggest carousel",
          "The mechanical elephant is the centre piece and well worth a ride. Children seem to love it - a mixture of awe and fear.",
          "It is interesting for children but a little overpriced. Stuff are nice but the boutique is a little expensive",
          "Visited the whole area of redevelopment on the island - following the green tourist line. The museum lets you in on the creators' amazing visions for the future of the park. Several machines can be watched in action, with the mechanical elephant as the star attraction. We",
          "My husband and I visited this place as he's alway interested in mechanics. I went along for the ride (pun intended). We had to queue for nearly an hour for entry. It was worth it though. It was hard to see the elevating giant spider as there were so many people in front of us.",
          "If you visit Nantes then this is a must visit.The machines are incredible and are fascinating for all ages and the rides on the Carousel are all sea creatures and wonderfully fanatstic, like something from Jules Verne",
          "Les Machines de l'\u00eele is a place for families and individual visitors alike. It features very creative mechanical animals, a glasshouse with tropical plants, a carousel adults love and the elephant, a very elaborate moving structure. Access is very easy. There is a car park",
          "We drove down after a few days at the WWII sites in Normandy, needing something a bit more lighthearted. There's a fabulous car park right across the street. We arrived late in the day, about an hour and 45 before closing which is a good time, I think. We didn't have to wait",
          "It blows my mind to wonder how the guys first came up with this concept and then kept going until it became a reality. Down on the docks, this renovated warehouse showcases fun, interactive demonstrations of giant caterpillars, ants, spiders and helicopters. You can see the",
          "This was our third visit. Okay we chose the wrong weekend to be in Nantes. Long weekend for most of Europe and 33 degree C temperature. Doh! So, first time we went the elephant was out of commission being serviced. The carousel was in its early stages of construction. Heron tree",
          "Visited this attraction free as included as part of the Nantes Pass. Nearest tram stop is over the river. Helpful staff suggesting the best ways to see exhibits while avoiding the many school trips.",
          "This is an absolute must if you are in the area. Try to visit all three parts, the gallery, the carousel and the elephant but leave plenty of time between them. Ideally you need at least 1 1/2 hours for each part. There is a lot of standing/ walking. The explanations are in",
          "Walk by the different halls and museum-style building to see the beautiful sculptures and animal machines that can move. Loved the huge elephant and the spider, a must see!",
          "Great thrill to see this mechanical elephant moving around. Had a ride on it and although you can't see much of the elephant it is interesting to see the workings, surrounding views and excitement of the children (and adults) down below as it sprays water, trumpets and walks",
          "I've visited several times now and never cease to be amazed - whilst The Elephant gets much deserved attention there is a lot more to see here! When you're done, then a nice walk by the Loire off to the left of the machines is well worth it.",
          "We have visited twice on trips to France in our Motorhome. The machines are very unique - especially the elephant and giant ant! You cannot see anything like them in England. I was able to go on the back of the giant ant and move its legs and antennae whilst it was moving",
          "Definitely worth visiting while in Nantes. It is more exciting when it is a bit busier. We came really early in the morning and even though we did manage to take nice pictures because of that, more people would have added more thrill while riding the machines. Great nevertheless!",
          "One of the best tourist experiences ever. A friend and I were spending the weekend in Nantes and le grand \u00e9l\u00e9phant got our attention when we were doing our research before the trip. What a great experience! It is a marvel of engineering, within easy walking distance of the",
          "We arrived just as the mechanical elephant was leaving loaded with folks up top. How exciting to see it go. We then enjoyed in amazement the adventures of the other mechanical beasts in the old ship building. Unfortunately no one was working in the workshop as that would be",
          "After museums and fortes and chateaus this was a really fun break. We were traveling through France with good friends who live just outside of Paris (they are French). They had no idea of this attraction. We stayed at a small Gites and explored Nante. My husband had heard of Les",
          "Visited this attraction last year with friends and it was brilliant. Although I couldn't go on the elephant due to ill health, it was brilliant to watch our friends on it. Les Machines are housed in a futuristic type of air shelter. It's a ten minute walk from the tram line",
          "We have been a number of times, always a mini spectaculer. Well worth the visit. You can, at a cost, ride the elephant and your trip includes a stop at the carousel included. The attached \"museum/workshop\" is a bit expensive for what it is. Interesting but \"worth the entry fee?\"",
          "It is really fun! There is a carroussel and a big elephant and a spider! You can ride them and it is a really great experience to take you back to your childhood!",
          "This place is spectacular for the child and adult. This machines are like transformers, for me.......",
          "Incerdible when you see the mechanic elephant walk around. The carrousel is really a \"need to see\" and when you go on the carroussels sea/air annimals you are part of the machinery (in a good sense) ;-)",
          "It was just something seeing the elephant moving around. But it was just fantastic viewing the gallery and seeing all the moving machines, we were not expecting such an experience.",
          "This is probably one of the most visited and written about attractions in Nantes, simply because of its uniqueness. The Galerie des Machines is generally open 7/7 between the hours of 1000-1800, but best check the \u201clesmachines-nantes\u201d web site for any changes to this schedule.",
          "This is an incredible experience if you like anything quirky or a little Heath Robinson. The talent of the workers and designers in creating these machines modelled like animals is amazing. Take a ride in the elephant and marvel at how over 40 tonnes of wood and metal 'walks'",
          "We only had an hour to explore this attraction. The mechanical beasts were amazing. There was a lot of talking from the guides which seemed very informative but unfortunately it was in French so we understood little. Demos were good though. If you want to ride the elephant in",
          "We had a great time on the elephant and the roundabout. A fun place to visit, with or without children.",
          "A must if going to Nantes. The machines and elephant are fantastic to see and made exactly like they would have done in the Victorian era. So unusual with so much detail and quirkiness.",

          "From the moment you arrive you know you are experiencing a one of a kind in the World!!!!! The walking Elephant so huge and real adults and children can enjoy the ride and then the 3 level carrousel, with rinding creatures full of details. When you go to France this is a MOST",
          "It's hard to describe this place. They are building huge and really cool animal-like artistic robots that people can sit in and ride. Very cool and worth the visit.",
          "We visited the site where the giant mechanical mamouth is on display. There are other exhibits too. The mamouth ride is cool, and it is a delight to see the children laugh and squeal as the mamouth jettisons water around as it moves. It is truly a wondrous machine to see. Not to",
          "The machines are very impressive that's what gives it the wow factor the elephant is one of the most impressive things I have seen, worth a visit to Nantes just for that, however the other instillations will be amazing in the future just needs time to develop further as it feels",
          "Highly recommend booking the elephant ride in advance to avoid queue & also ensure that you go at a specific time as only a limited number can go. Very good. Interesting workmanship. 30 minutes on elephant. Plenty of time to walk around. A great family day out",
          "Fantastic place to go. A must see! Make sure to visit both sides of the exhibition. Take plenty of pictures.",
          "We got there before it opened but the sight of the crazy wood and leather giant elephant parked outside, replete with a cab to ride in...tasty!",
          "An amazing mechanical themed attraction with a Jules Verne feel. The huge mechanical elephant was mesmerising!",
          "Nowhere else will you find such an abstract and unusual theme park. My sister is a teenage and was rather reluctant to go however she really enjoyed the carousel and the museum. A must-see attraction.",
          "Well worth visiting - the people of Nantes certainly know how to astonish and amaze. I would recommend that anyone contemplating a visit allows sufficient time because this is certainly not a place that can be absorbed with a simply viewing - there is so much to see, to",
          "I definitely recommend this in the weekend, in a Sunday to be more precise. The elephant is open to the public and it's interesting to see how it works when it's walking. Be careful with opening times.",
          "Great experience. Interesting to see all the mechanical parts in motion. Book in advance as limited spaces. Free entry to view workshop area a new projects.",
          "An unusual trip in a mechanical elephant, journey was 30 minutes and travelled approximately 1 km. Make sure you pre-book online at least 2 days in advance. The queues build up exceptionally quick and spaces are limited",
          "This place is a Magical Steampunk Wonderland, where we get to see the genius French creative mind at work in the creation of these quirky machines . Jules Verne would even be blown away. Never have seen the likes of this in the USA. A Must see!",
          "Rasy to get to on public transport from train station.long queues for visit inside, and for elephant Exhibition brilliant. Long walk in the sun to Carousel.Caf\u011b in main building not very good. Not enough loos around site, so go when you pass one! Was a fairly good visit but",
          "We went to this place when we were on holiday the boys loved it. Crazy merry go round and fantastic metal robotics. Parking a motorhome can be tricky and be trying to figure out the charges was a task, but 2 french guys tried to explain to me that I only had to pay up to 12",
          "Les Machines de L'ile are a bunch of animal shaped robots. Said like that it sounds boring and uninteresting but the reality exceeds the expectations. Housed in the hold hangars of the ancient Nantes shipyard, this mechanical heaven is, according to its creators, a mix of the",

          "There were many interesting machines to view in the gallery. We also took a ride on the elephant, which took about 30 or 40 minutes to walk from the gallery to the carousel; it would normally take about 5 minutes to walk to the carousel from the gallery. I think it would have",
          "Going to see the elephant is a must when visiting the beautiful city of Nantes. It is so unusual and bizarre and like nothing I ve seen before. It is beautifully made and fun to ride in especially when the trunk squirts water out at passers-by. The thoughtful organizers even",

          "This was an absolutely stunning exhibit of incredible machines! The guides do a great job at explaining the philosophy and purpose of the project and how each of the machines work. I went pretty late so there weren't a lot of people.... This meant I got a chance to be picked to",
          "This place is magical, the elephant is amazing. You can just walk through the island. There are s lot bars and shop, it's a really good walk. There is also sculptures to be seen at night also !",
          "very expensive unnecessarily .everything was in French . i think is better to saw only with out ticket",
          "There is no way that one can describe the impact of a visit to Les Machines. There are so many fascinating full and over sized animated animals and mythical figures to see and so many opportunities for children, and indeed adults to interact with the objects. Everyone should",
          "By far 'Les Machines de L'ile' is the main reason to visit Nantes. You have to see and ride the Elephant with your own eyes to believe this is possible. We had a great time at this attraction, despite the October wheather. This attraction really deserves to be supported by",
          "A nice time for the little ones and also for the grown ups! The evidence that when there is creativity and financial support you can build a tourist attraction out of nothing and give a new life to old spaces that had lost their reason to exist.",
          "The elephant is advertised as the main attraction here. The \"machines\" are really amazing, especially the giant elephant which just happened to do his little walk as we arrived on site. This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Nantes.",

        "wiki": "Versailles (French pronunciation: [v\u025b\u0281s\u0251j] (listen)) is a city in the Yvelines d\u00e9partement in the \u00cele-de-France region, renowned worldwide for the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles and the gardens of Versailles, designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Located in the western suburbs of the French capital, 17.1 km (10.6 mi) from the centre of Paris, Versailles is in the 21st century a wealthy suburb of Paris with a service-based economy and a major tourist destination as well.  According to the 2008 census, the population of the city is 88,641 inhabitants, down from a peak of 94,145 in 1975.\nA new town founded at the will of King Louis XIV, Versailles was the de facto capital of the Kingdom of France for over a century, from 1682 to 1789, before becoming the cradle of the French Revolution. After having lost its status of royal city, it became the pr\u00e9fecture (regional capital) of the Seine-et-Oise d\u00e9partement in 1790, then of Yvelines in 1968. It is also a Roman Catholic diocese. \nVersailles is historically known for numerous treaties such as the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution, and the Treaty of Versailles, after World War I. Today, the Congress of France \u2013 the name given to the body created when both houses of the French Parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, meet \u2013 gathers in the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles to vote on revisions to the Constitution.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe argument over the etymology of Versailles tends to privilege the Latin word versare, meaning \"to keep turning, turn over and over\", an expression used in medieval times for plowed lands, cleared lands (lands that had been repeatedly \"turned over\"). This word formation is similar to Latin seminare (\"to sow\") which gave French semailles (\"sowings\", \"sown seeds\").\nDuring the Revolution of 1789, city officials had proposed to the Convention to rename Versailles Berceau-de-la-Libert\u00e9 (\"Cradle of Liberty\"), but they had to retract their proposal when confronted with the objections of the majority of the population.\n\n\n== A seat of power ==\nFrom May 1682, when Louis XIV moved the court and government permanently to Versailles, until his death in September 1715, Versailles was the unofficial capital of the kingdom of France. For the next seven years, during the R\u00e9gence of Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, the royal court of the young King Louis XV was the first in Paris, while the Regent governed from his Parisian residence, the Palais-Royal. Versailles was again the unofficial capital of France from June 1722, when Louis XV returned to Versailles, until October 1789, when a Parisian mob forced Louis XVI and the royal family to move to Paris. Versailles again became the unofficial capital of France from March 1871, when Adolphe Thiers' government took refuge in Versailles, fleeing the insurrection of the Paris Commune, until November 1879, when the newly elected government and parliament returned to Paris. During the various periods when government affairs were conducted from Versailles, Paris remained the official capital of France.\nVersailles was made the pr\u00e9fecture of the Seine-et-Oise d\u00e9partement at its inception in March 1790 (at which time Seine-et-Oise had approximately 420,000 inhabitants). By the 1960s, with the growth of the Paris suburbs, the Seine-et-Oise had reached more than 2 million inhabitants, and was deemed too large and ungovernable, and thus it was split into three d\u00e9partements in January 1968. Versailles was made the pr\u00e9fecture of the Yvelines d\u00e9partement, the largest chunk of the former Seine-et-Oise. At the 2006 census the Yvelines had 1,395,804 inhabitants.Versailles is the seat of a Roman Catholic diocese (bishopric) which was created in 1790. The diocese of Versailles is subordinate to the archdiocese of Paris.\nIn 1975, Versailles was made the seat of a Court of Appeal whose jurisdiction covers the western suburbs of Paris.\nSince 1972, Versailles has been the seat of one of France's 30 nationwide acad\u00e9mies (districts) of the Ministry of National Education. The acad\u00e9mie de Versailles, the largest of France's thirty acad\u00e9mies by its number of pupils and students, is in charge of supervising all the elementary schools and high schools of the western suburbs of Paris.\nVersailles is also an important node for the French army, a tradition going back to the monarchy with, for instance, the military camp of Satory and other institutions.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nVersailles is located 17.1 km (10.6 mi) west-southwest from the centre of Paris. The city sits on an elevated plateau, 130 to 140 metres (425 to 460 ft) above sea-level (whereas the elevation of the centre of Paris is only 33 m (108 ft) above sea level), surrounded by wooded hills: in the north the forests of Marly and Fausses-Reposes, and in the south the forests of Satory and Meudon.\nThe city (commune) of Versailles has an area of 26.18 km2 (10.11 sq mi, or 6,469 acres), which is a quarter of the area of the city of Paris. In 1989, Versailles had a population density of 3,344/km2 (8,660/sq mi), whereas Paris had a density of 20,696/km2 (53,602/sq mi).\nBorn out of the will of a king, the city has a rational and symmetrical grid of streets. By the standards of the 18th century, Versailles was a very modern European city. Versailles was used as a model for the building of Washington, D.C. by Pierre Charles L'Enfant.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of Versailles appears for the first time in a medieval document dated 1038. In the feudal system of medieval France, the lords of Versailles came directly under the king of France, with no intermediary overlords between them and the king; yet they were not very important lords. In the end of the 11th century, the village curled around a medieval castle and the Saint Julien church. Its farming activity and its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought prosperity to the village, culminating in the end of the 13th century, the so-called \"century of Saint Louis\", famous for the prosperity of northern France and the building of Gothic cathedrals. The 14th century brought the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War, and with it death and destruction. At the end of the Hundred Years' War in the 15th century, the village started to recover, with a population of only 100 inhabitants.\nIn 1561, Martial de Lom\u00e9nie, secretary of state for finances under King Charles IX, became lord of Versailles. He obtained permission to establish four annual fairs and a weekly market on Thursdays. The population of Versailles was 500 inhabitants. Martial de Lom\u00e9nie was murdered during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (24 August 1572). In 1575, Albert de Gondi, a man from Florence who had come to France with Catherine de' Medici, bought the seigneury of Versailles.\n\n\n=== Louis XIII ===\n\nHenceforth Versailles was the possession of the Gondi family, a family of wealthy and influential parliamentarians at the Parlement of Paris. Several times during the 1610s, the de Gondis invited King Louis XIII to hunt in the large forests around Versailles. In 1622, the king purchased a parcel of forest for his private hunting. In 1624, he acquired more and entrusted Philibert Le Roy with the construction of a small hunting lodge of red bricks and stone with a slate roof. In 1632, the king bought the totality of the land and seigneury of Versailles from Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Gondi. The hunting lodge was enlarged to the size of a small ch\u00e2teau between 1632 and 1634.\nAt the death of Louis XIII, in 1643, the village had 1,000 inhabitants.\nThis small ch\u00e2teau was the site of one of the historical events that took place during the reign of Louis XIII, on 10 November 1630, when, on the Day of the Dupes, the party of the queen mother was defeated and Richelieu was confirmed as Prime minister.\n\n\n=== Louis XIV ===\nKing Louis XIV, son of Louis XIII, was only five years old when his father died. It was 20 years later, in 1661, when Louis XIV commenced his personal reign, that the young king showed interest in Versailles. The idea of leaving Paris, where, as a child, he had experienced first-hand the insurrection of the Fronde, had never left him. Louis XIV commissioned his architect Le Vau and his landscape architect Le N\u00f4tre to transform the castle of his father, as well as the park, in order to accommodate the court. In 1678, after the Treaty of Nijmegen, the king decided that the court and the government would be established permanently in Versailles, which happened on 6 May 1682.\nAt the same time, a new city was emerging from the ground, resulting from an ingenious decree of the king dated 22 May 1671, whereby the king authorized anyone to acquire a lot in the new city for free. There were only two conditions to acquire a lot: 1- a token tax of 5 shillings (5 sols) per arpent of land should be paid every year ($0.03 per 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) per year in 2005 US dollars); 2- a house should be built on the lot according to the plans and models established by the Surintendant des B\u00e2timents du Roi (architect in chief of the royal demesne). The plans provided for a city built symmetrically with respect to the Avenue de Paris (which starts from the entrance of the castle). The roofs of the buildings and houses of the new city were not to exceed the level of the Marble Courtyard, at the entrance of the castle (built above a hill dominating the city), so that the perspective from the windows of the castle would not be obstructed.\nThe old village and the Saint Julien church were demolished to make room for buildings housing the administrative services managing the daily life in the castle. On both sides of the Avenue de Paris were built the Notre-Dame neighborhood and the Saint-Louis neighborhood, with new large churches, markets, aristocratic mansions, all built in very homogeneous style according to the models established by the Surintendant des B\u00e2timents du Roi. Versailles was a vast construction site for many years. Little by little came to Versailles all those who needed or desired to live close to the maximum power. At the death of the Sun King in 1715, the village of Versailles had turned into a city of approximately 30,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Louis XV and Louis XVI ===\nWhen the court of King Louis XV returned to Versailles in 1722, the city had 24,000 inhabitants. With the reign of Louis XV, Versailles grew even further. Versailles was the capital of the most powerful kingdom in Europe, and the whole of Europe admired its new architecture and design trends. Soon enough, the strict building rules decided under Louis XIV were not respected anymore, real estate speculation flourished, and the lots that had been given for free under Louis XIV were now on the market for hefty prices. By 1744, the population reached 37,000 inhabitants. The cityscape changed considerably under kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. Buildings were now taller. King Louis XV built a Ministry of War, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (where the Treaty of Paris (1783) ending the American Revolutionary War was signed in 1783 with the United Kingdom), and a Ministry of the Navy. By 1789, the population had reached 60,000 inhabitants, and Versailles was now the seventh or eighth-largest city of France, and one of the largest cities of Europe.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\nSeat of the political power, Versailles naturally became the cradle of the French Revolution. The Estates-General met in Versailles on 5 May 1789. The members of the Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, and the National Constituent Assembly abolished feudalism on 4 August 1789. Eventually, on 5 and 6 October 1789, a crowd of women joined by some members of the national guard from Paris invaded the castle to protest bread prices and forced the royal family to move to Paris. The National Constituent Assembly followed the king to Paris soon afterwards, and Versailles lost its role of capital city.\nFrom then on, Versailles lost a good deal of its inhabitants. From 60,000, the population had declined to 26,974 inhabitants by 1806. The castle, stripped of its furniture and ornaments during the Revolution, was left abandoned, with only Napoleon briefly staying one night there and then leaving the castle for good. Louis-Philippe, who took the throne in the July Revolution of 1830, transformed the palace into a National Museum dedicated to \"all the glories of France\" in 1837. Versailles had become a sleepy town, a place of pilgrimage for those nostalgic for the old monarchy.\n\n\n=== 19th century to the present day ===\nThe Franco-Prussian War of 1870 put Versailles in the limelight again. On 18 January 1871 the victorious Germans proclaimed the king of  Prussia,  Wilhelm I, emperor of  Germany in the very Hall of Mirrors of the castle, in an attempt to take revenge for the conquests of Louis XIV two centuries earlier. Then in March of the same year, following the insurrection of the Paris Commune, the French Third Republic  government under  Thiers relocated to Versailles, and from there directed the military suppression of the insurrection. The government and the French parliament stayed in Versailles after the quelling of the Commune (May 1871), and it was even thought for some time that the capital of France would move definitely to Versailles in order to avoid the revolutionary mood of Paris in the future.\nRestoration of a monarchy almost occurred in 1873, with parliament offering the crown to Henri, comte de Chambord, but his refusal to accept the  tricolor flag that had been adopted during the Revolution made the restoration of monarchy impossible for the time being. Versailles became again the political center of France, full of buzz and rumors, with its population briefly peaking at 61,686 in 1872, matching the record level of population reached on the eve of the French Revolution 83 years earlier. Eventually, however, left-wing republicans won a string of parliamentary elections, defeating the parties supporting a restoration of the monarchy, and the new majority decided to relocate the government to Paris in November 1879. Versailles then experienced a new population setback (48,324 inhabitants at the 1881 census). After that, Versailles never again functioned as the seat of the capital of France, but the presence of the  French Parliament there in the 1870s left a vast hall, built in one aisle of the palace, which the French Parliament uses when it meets in  Congress to amend the French Constitution, as well as when the President of France addresses the two chambers of the French Parliament.\n\nOnly in 1911 did Versailles definitely recover its level of population of 1789, with 60,458 inhabitants at the 1911 census. In 1919, at the end of the First World War, Versailles came into the limelight again as the various treaties ending the war were signed in the castle proper and in the Grand Trianon. After 1919, as the suburbs of Paris continued to expand, Versailles was absorbed by the urban area of Paris and the city experienced a strong demographic and economic growth, turning it into a large suburban city of the metropolitan area of Paris. The role of Versailles as an administrative and judicial center has been reinforced in the 1960s and 1970s, and somehow Versailles has become the main center of the western suburbs of Paris.\nThe center of the town has kept its very bourgeois atmosphere, while more middle-class neighborhoods have developed around the train stations and in the outskirts of the city. Versailles is a chic suburb of Paris, well linked with the center of Paris by several train lines. However, the city is extremely compartmentalized, divided by large avenues inherited from the monarchy which create the impression of several small cities ignoring each other. Versailles was never an industrial city, even though there are a few chemical and food-processing plants. Essentially, Versailles is a place of services, such as public administration, tourism, business congresses, and festivals. From 1951 until France's withdrawal from the NATO unified command in 1966, nearby Rocquencourt functioned as the site for SHAPE. Versailles is an important military center, with several units and training schools headquartered at the Satory military base, which hosted the headquarters of the famed 2nd French Armored Division until 1999, and where a military exhibition is organized annually.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nVersailles' primary cultural attraction is the Palace, with its ornately decorated rooms and historic significance. The town also has other points of cultural notability; in recent times, its position as an affluent suburb of Paris has meant that it forms a part of the Paris artistic scene, and musical groups such as Phoenix, Air and Daft Punk have some link to the city, as does the director Michel Gondry.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFootball Club de Versailles 78 is a semi-professional association football club founded in 1989. Their home stadium is the Stade de Montbauron, which has a capacity of 6,208 people.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe headquarters of the Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University are located in the city, as well as the ISIPCA, a post graduate school in perfume, cosmetics products and food flavor formulation.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nVersailles is served by Versailles \u2013 Chantiers station, which is an interchange station on Paris RER line C, on the Transilien La D\u00e9fense suburban rail line, on the Transilien Paris \u2013 Montparnasse suburban rail line, and on several national rail lines, including low-frequency TGV service.\nVersailles is also served by two other stations on Paris RER line C: Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau\u2013Rive-Gauche (the closest station to the Palace of Versailles and consequently the station most frequently used by tourists) and Porchefontaine.\nVersailles is also served by two stations on the Transilien Paris \u2013 Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: Versailles-Rive-Droite and Montreuil.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nVersailles is twinned with:\n Potsdam, Germany\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nPhilip V of Spain (1683\u20131746), King of Spain\nCharles-Michel de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e (1712\u20131789), philanthropic educator\nLouis-Augustin Richer (1740\u20131819), singer and composer\nLazare Hoche (1768\u20131797), general\nGeorges Pfeiffer (1835\u20131908), composer and pianist\nL\u00e9onie Yahne (1867-1950), actress\nYves Brayer (1907-1990), painter\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boucher (1908-1934), pilot\nAlbert Malbois (1915-2017), Roman Catholic bishop\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard (1924-1998), philosopher\nSt\u00e9phane Audran (born 1932), actress\nJo\u00eblle M\u00e9lin (born 1950), politician\nMarine Jahan (born 1959), dancer\nBruno Podalyd\u00e8s (born 1961), writer, director and actor\nMichel Gondry (born 1963), film and music video director\nSt\u00e9phane Franke (1964-2011), Franco-German athlete\nJean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel (born 1965), musician\nMabrouk El Mechri (born 1976), director, screenwriter and actor\nThomas Mars (born 1977), rock musician\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u00c9tablissement public du ch\u00e2teau, du mus\u00e9e et du domaine national de Versailles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWikimapia satellite view\nCity council website\nSatellite Image of Versailles\nPalace of Versailles photos",

          "Having come from the original just 2 months ago, I was a bit disappointed, but this is only my personal opinion. The area is quite isolated and there were some young couples who wanted their privacy, and there was some small children in a park, but it is not big, so don't come",

        "wiki": "Nantes (, also US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303t] (listen); Gallo: Naunnt or Nantt [n\u0251\u0303(\u02d0)t]; Breton: Naoned [\u02c8n\u00e3un\u0259t]) is a city in Loire-Atlantique on the Loire, 50 km (31 mi) from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth-largest in France, with a population of  303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants. With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis.\nIt is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.\nNantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\nIn 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nNantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its confluence with the Erdre. The origin of the name \"Namnetes\" is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *nant- (river or stream, from the pre-Celtic root *nanto, valley) or from Amnites, another tribal name possibly meaning \"men of the river\".Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00fainkon) and \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kondio\u00fainkon)\u2014which might be read as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00faikon)\u2014in his treatise, Geography. The name was latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as Condevincum (the most common form), Condevicnum, Condivicnum and Condivincum. Although its origins are unclear, \"Condevincum\" seems to be related to the Gaulish word condate \"confluence\".The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as Portus Namnetum \"port of the Namnetes\" and civitas Namnetum \"city of the Namnetes\". Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one; Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes' name continued to evolve, becoming Naneti\u00e6 and Namnetis during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).\n\n\n=== Modern pronunciation and nicknames ===\nNantes is pronounced [n\u0251\u0303t], and the city's inhabitants are known as Nantais [n\u0251\u0303t\u025b]. In Gallo, the o\u00efl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled Naunnt or Nantt and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long [\u0251\u0303]. In Breton, Nantes is known as Naoned or an Naoned, the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton toponyms than in French ones.Nantes' historical nickname was \"Venice of the West\" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit\u00e9 des Ducs \"the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]\" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region's subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rez\u00e9) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes' inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing 16 hectares (40 acres), was one of the largest in Gaul.Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288\u2013290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nLike much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. After Charlemagne's death in 814,  Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city's main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). The 15th century is considered Nantes' first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. At the end of the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town. However, the edict did not reflect local opinion in the Catholic League stronghold. The local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000, and Nantes was one of the last places to resist the authority of Protestant-raised Henry IV. The edict was signed after the capitulation of the Duke of Merc\u0153ur, governor of Brittany.Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city's largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous h\u00f4tels particuliers.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nThe French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vend\u00e9e attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, Fran\u00e7ois de Charette, was executed in Nantes.After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire \"the national bathtub\".The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon's Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nOutlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from R\u00e9union in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on R\u00e9union sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours\u2013Saint-Nazaire railway.Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be transhipped before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a 15 kilometres (9.3 miles)-long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.\n\n\n=== Land reclamation ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as \"the 50 hostages\" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes' industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as \"Nantes Atlantique\" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.The death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nNantes is in north-western France, near the Atlantic Ocean and 342 kilometres (213 miles) south-west of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is  274 kilometres (170 miles) south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orl\u00e9ans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vend\u00e9e (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around 47\u00b013\u2032N 1\u00b032\u2032W).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe Loire is about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is 60 kilometres (37 miles) in length. The river's bed and banks have  changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about 30 kilometres (19 miles) further east. The tidal range can reach 6 metres (20 feet) in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the S\u00e8vre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nNantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 metres (125 feet) above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching 52 metres (171 feet) in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching 30 metres (98 feet). The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNantes has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. The climatic conditions allow to be typically in this zone with almost no influence of the continent as in Paris, the city has strict variations of temperatures and few freezing days in average annual, in addition to a precipitation higher, but also being able to be described informally as a \"Mediterranean altered\" for 1971-2000 normals. Rainfall and its pattern exemplifies this (winters rainier than other seasons), although it is a relatively high total fall in every month (too high average temperature), but in the future may be closer to a dry summer defined if trends persist. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F); snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). Rain is abundant through the year, with an annual average of 820 millimetres (32 inches). The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n\nNantes' layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes' most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and h\u00f4tels particuliers. The area was extended towards the Parc de Proc\u00e9 during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudi\u00e8re and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.\n\nAfter World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes' growing population. The oldest, Les Dervalli\u00e8res, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rez\u00e9, Vertou and Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and  north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.The 4.6-square-kilometre (1.8 sq mi) Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.\n\n\n=== Parks and environment ===\n\nNantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering 218 hectares (540 acres). The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old Magnolia grandiflora and the national collection of camellia. Other large parks include the Parc de Proc\u00e9, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudini\u00e8re, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional 180 hectares (440 acres), include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes' area.The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nNantes is the pr\u00e9fecture (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion. It is the residence of a r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement prefect, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement councils, two elected political bodies.\nThe city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers' Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes' first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold.Since 1995 Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (quartiers), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each  quartier to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes M\u00e9tropole, it encompasses the city's metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes M\u00e9tropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes M\u00e9tropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020 the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes M\u00e9tropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nLocal authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.Nantes' coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city's coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939\u201345 War Cross were added in 1948.Before the revolution, Nantes' motto was \"Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine\" (\"The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord\", a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto\u2014\"Favet Neptunus eunti\" (\"Neptune favours the traveller\")\u2014in 1816. Nantes' flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.\n\n\n=== Nantes and Brittany ===\n\nNantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five d\u00e9partements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining d\u00e9partements into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement formed a new region with four other d\u00e9partements, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (\"Loire Countries\") although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe P\u00e9tain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.Debate continues about Nantes' place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is  similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.\n\n\n=== Twinning ===\n\nNantes has made nine international sister-city arrangements since 1964. Arrangements have been made with:\nCardiff, Wales (1964)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Germany (1965)\nTbilisi, Georgia (1979)\nSeattle and Jacksonville, Florida (1980-1984)\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (1991)\nNiigata, Niigata, Japan (1999)\nDurban, South Africa (2005)\nQingdao, China (2005)\nSuncheon, Jeonnam, South Korea (2007)The city has made agreements with other cities and regions, including Turin, Liverpool, Hamburg, Asturias and Quebec. Partnership agreements have been signed with cities in developing countries, including Dschang, Cameroon, Grand'Anse, Haiti and Kindia, Guinea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nNantes had 298,029 inhabitants in 2016, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes' population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring communes of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding communes. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity, religions and languages ===\n\nNantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.Nantes is historically a Catholic city, with a cathedral, two minor basilicas, about 40 churches and around 20 chapels. Western France is traditionally religious, and the Catholic influence on Nantes was more persistent than in other large French cities. However, it has waned since the 1970s because of the rise of atheism and secularism. Although Nantes is where Protestantism was permitted in France through its edict, Protestants have always formed a small minority. The main Protestant church belongs to the United Protestant Church of France, but the city also has a number of newer Evangelical and Baptist churches. Nantes had a small Jewish community during the Middle Ages, but Jews were expelled from Brittany in 1240 and Judaism only reappeared after the French Revolution. The city has one synagogue, built in 1852. The city had several hundred Muslim inhabitants during the 1950s, but (as in the rest of France) their number increased in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of large numbers of Africans and Turks. Nantes' first mosque was built in 1976, with three more built in 2010\u20132012.The city is part of the territory of the langues d'o\u00efl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (parler nantais) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFor centuries, Nantes' economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN Biscuit), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with 500,000 square metres (5,400,000 square feet) of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.\n\nThe city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing \u20ac55 billion annually; \u20ac29 billion returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes M\u00e9tropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseilles, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region's largest retail area  with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France's seventh-most-visited city.In 2014, 74.6 percent of the city's businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes\u2013Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nNantes' cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-\u00c9tienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside  the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.\n\nSeveral 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes' medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes' chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860. \n\nAfter the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the pr\u00e9fecture, 1763\u20131783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790\u20131815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the h\u00f4tels particuliers and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called \"Nantais baroque\".\n\nMost of Nantes' churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840\u20131843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lef\u00e8vre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city's largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.The Dobr\u00e9e Museum, closed for repairs as of 2017, houses the d\u00e9partement's archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany's heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a  12-metre-tall (39 ft), walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the Machines were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes' largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nLe Z\u00e9nith Nantes M\u00e9tropole, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France's largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes' largest venue is La Cit\u00e9, Nantes Events Center, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre universitaire and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nThe Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan's Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.Estuaire contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet and Dan Graham.La Folle Journ\u00e9e (The Mad Day, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfi\u00e8re d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univercin\u00e9 (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.\n\n\n=== Slavery Memorial ===\nA path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word \u201cfreedom\u201d written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st.  At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.\n\n\n=== In the arts ===\n\nNantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since Andr\u00e9 Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vach\u00e9 there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), Andr\u00e9 Breton called Nantes \"perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me\". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 M\u00e9moires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Mus\u00e9e noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: Lola (1964) and A Room in Town (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include God's Thunder by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re (1965), The Married Couple of the Year Two by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), Day Off by Pascal Thomas (2001) and Black Venus by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard's Keep Your Right Up was filmed at its airport in 1987.Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007's \"Nantes\" by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include \"Nantes\" by Barbara (1964) and \"Nantes\" by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. \"Dans les prisons de Nantes\" is the most popular, with versions recorded by \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include \"Le pont de Nantes\" (recorded by Guy B\u00e9art in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), \"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Nantes\" (a sea shanty) and the bawdy \"De Nantes \u00e0 Montaigu\".British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the \"special character\" of the local \"plebeian\" cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes' largest and best-known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.Beurre blanc is Nantes' most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), berlingot (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar rigolette sweets with marmalade filling, g\u00e2teau nantais (a rum cake invented in 1820), Cur\u00e9 nantais and M\u00e2checoulais cheeses and fouace, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien R\u00e9gime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013\u20132014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students. The university is part of the EPSCP Bretagne-Loire Universit\u00e9, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region's academic and research potential.In addition to the university, Nantes has a number of colleges and other institutes of higher education. Audencia, a private management school, is ranked as one of the world's best by the Financial Times and The Economist. The city has five engineering schools: Oniris (veterinary medicine and food safety), \u00c9cole centrale de Nantes (mechanical and civil engineering), Polytech Nantes (digital technology and civil engineering), \u00c9cole des mines de Nantes (nuclear technology, safety and energy) and ICAM (research and logistics). Nantes has three other  grandes \u00e9coles: the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure du bois (forestry and wood processing), the School of Design and Exi-Cesi (computing). Other institutes of higher education include a national merchant navy school, a fine-arts school, a national architectural school and Epitech and Supinfo (computing).\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNantes has several large sports facilities. The largest is the Stade de la Beaujoire, built for UEFA Euro 1984. The stadium, which also hosted matches during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, has 37,473 seats. The second-largest venue is the Hall XXL, an exhibition hall on the Stade de la Beaujoire grounds. The 10,700-seat stadium was selected as a venue for the 2017 World Men's Handball Championship. Smaller facilities include the 4,700-seat indoor Palais des Sports, a venue for EuroBasket 1983. The nearby Mangin Beaulieu sports complex has 2,500 seats and Pierre Quinon Stadium, an athletics stadium within the University of Nantes, has 790 seats. La Trocardi\u00e8re, an indoor 4,238-seat stadium, is in Rez\u00e9. The Erdre has a marina and a centre for rowing, sailing and canoeing, and the city has six swimming pools.Six teams in Nantes play at a high national or international level. Best known is FC Nantes, which is a member of Ligue 1 for the 2018\u201319 season. Since its formation in 1943, the club has won eight Championnat titles and three Coupes de France. FC Nantes has several French professional football records, including the most consecutive seasons in the elite division (44), most wins in a season (26), consecutive wins (32) and consecutive home wins (92 games, nearly five years). In handball, volleyball and basketball, Nantes' men's and women's clubs play in the French first division: HBC Nantes and Nantes Loire Atlantique Handball (handball), Nantes Rez\u00e9 M\u00e9tropole Volley and Volley-Ball Nantes (volleyball) and Hermine de Nantes Atlantique and Nantes Rez\u00e9 Basket (basketball). The men's Nantes Erdre Futsal futsal team plays in the Championnat de France de Futsal, and the main athletics team (Nantes M\u00e9tropole Athl\u00e9tisme) includes some of France's best athletes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe city is linked to Paris by the A11 motorway, which passes through Angers, Le Mans and Chartres. Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a 43-kilometre (27 mi) ring road around the city, France's second-longest after the ring in Bordeaux.Nantes' central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercit\u00e9s trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orl\u00e9ans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) south-east of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as \"Tan\". One of the world's first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of 43.5 kilometres (27.0 miles) of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Ch\u00e2teaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.\n\n\n=== Nantes Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Nantes & Saint-Nazaire, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 40 min. 7.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

She was built by Arsenal de Lorient in Lorient, commissioned on 4 May 1957 and named after the French admiral Jean Armand de Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 (1619\u20131646).\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 2 March 1962, Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9, along with another four destroyers, landed fresh troops at Algiers to fight the OAS upsurge. Assisted by her sister ship Surcouf, she was about to shell the OAS-held quarter of Bab-el-Oued when a counter-order called the operation off. The destroyers instead took battle stations close to the shore as a deterrent.In 1988 she was decommissioned and became a museum ship in Nantes. She has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since October 1991.On 21 February 2016, director Christopher Nolan announced plans to feature the ship in his upcoming World War II film Dunkirk. In the film, she portrayed two British destroyers \u2013 sister ships HMS Vivacious and HMS Vanquisher \u2013 by simultaneously carrying the D36 pennant number of Vivacious on her port side and Vanquisher's pennant D54 on her starboard side.\n\n\n== References ==\nConway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1947-1995\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 naval museum, Nantes\nRoll of Honour",

        "wiki": "The Machines of the Isle of Nantes (Les Machines de l'\u00eele) is an artistic, touristic and cultural project based in Nantes, France. In the old covered buildings of the former shipyards in Nantes that were at one time used for ship construction (les nefs), and later used as business sites, the Machines of the Isle are created by two artists, Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re (of La Machine production company) and Pierre Orefice (of Manaus association).\nThe projects aim to promote the city's image and intend to build an identity for it as a creative metropolis of dream and of fantasy. The site was opened to the public on 1 July 2007.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe Great Elephant (2007) is a mechanical elephant, 12 metres (39 ft) and 8 metres (26 ft) meters wide, made from 45 tons of wood and steel. It can take up to 49 passengers for a 45-minute walk.  It is an inexact replica of The Sultan's Elephant from Royal de Luxe, which toured the world from 2005 to 2007; the main difference being that this elephant is designed to carry spectators.\nThe Marine Worlds Carousel (2012) is a huge carousel, rising nearly 25m high and measuring 20m in diameter. It features 35 moving underwater creatures on three levels: the ocean floor, the depths, and sea and boats. Visitors will be able to move about amidst a ballet of aquatic animals and sea carriages, as well as climb aboard and guide the movements of the Machines.\n\nThe Heron Tree (2014) is a steel structure 45 meters in diameter and 28 meters in height, topped with two herons.  The project plans to allow visitors to climb either onto the back or onto the wings of the birds for a circular flight over the hanging gardens of the tree.\nThe Machine Gallery is an exhibition place to illustrate the background story of the machines.  Some visitors are invited to control marine animals or the European Flight Test Center. The entire process of the construction is on display by sketches, models and films.  In July 2008, three new machines were added into the gallery.\nThe Workshop is the site of fabrication for people to observe the ongoing building process. Today, the construction of the Marine Worlds occupies one part of the workshop.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Machines of the Isle of Nantes - Official website (in English)\nNantes Metropole Tourism Office (in English)\nThe Machines de l'Ile YouTube channel\nPhotographs of the machines and workshop\nSlideshow : some pictures of the machines from the Carousel being built (2010)\nBen Morris (18 April 2012). \"Nantes' theme park economics at Machines de L'Ile\".

          "We were in Nantes for 2 days, so booked the elephant on line for the last ride of the day,unfortunately the elephant had a fault and was not working. We were given a refund and told that there was a possibility of booking the next morning. We arrived very early and were able to",

          "If your in to your giant machines that look like animals you can't go wrong with this place. How they make things look so real and move is amazing. I would recommend buying tickets before yougo as we had to que for what seemed like a long time. Multi storey car park on next",
          "Worth to try the 3-level carousel and the elephant ride. If you don\u2019t understand French, then don\u2019t take the Galleria tour. It is better to buy the ticket online as there is a long queue for walk-in ticket.",
          "Watched the elephant walk around then queued up for an hour to go in and watch the machines. Don't bother the staff there just show the machines in action, which are all underwhelming and for 16 Euros! We stayed 30 minutes then went to see the workshop. It is just that a",
          "We pre-booked the elephant - this was the best part, amazing and not like any other tourist experience we've had in years. I guess you could enjoy the spectacle of it walking for free just by being somewhere on the route but being on the elephant added to the humour and",
          "We waited in the queue for 2 hours and after reading the reviews was expecting an amazing experience but alas the wait was not worth it. We had tried to book online with no success and after reading different reviews it probably wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. As we had",
          "Tried to book the elephant before our visit last week, but left it too late and it was full. If you want to ride the elephant I strongly recommend you book a date/slot weeks in advance on line. So decided to book the gallerie on line instead. When we arrived we went to the",
          "So we set out on a sunny Tuesday in August (admittedly in the middle of the French summer break) to see the \u201cLes Machines\u201d. The queue was about 100 yards long to get in which looked ok. Two hours later and we reach the front of the queue to find two people selling tickets. Oh",
          "I visited Les Machines de L'ile having heard wonderful things, and expected to be wowed by feats of engineering. The elephant, as predicted, was magnificent, and kept those of us waiting in the queue for the gallerie entertained as it went past. However, everything else sadly",
          "This was my second visit to see the Elephant, this time was better as it was sunny and not raining, I didn\u2019t go on the Elephant as I wanted to look at it and didn\u2019t feel the view would be as good. I\u2019m sure I will go again some day",
          "Just go ! Worth a visit ! As an engineer I just stood amazed of the concept and machines they make. It\u2019s just most amazing to see the elephant tour around....",

          "But let me be clear on that; the elephant is something you must see! Walking next to it is simply great. The tickets for less machines are oke but it is really busy and they explain everything in French only. There is 1 person that can do a ride and to be honest we didn't think",
          "Great attraction. Also suitable for small children. If you are in hurry if simply just don't want to pay for the Elephant Ride you don't have to do it. The Elephant walks through the whole area. If you don\u2019t book the tickets online there is a queue, so you have to wait for",
          "enjoy the carosell. chose from 3 levels (level 2 is height restricted) waggle leavers and make bits move. fun for all",
          "Came here with my brother and parents and was blown away by the marvellous machines they had here! As soon as we arrived, a massive elephant approached! It turns out that was \u201cthe grand elephant\u201d that people could ride on. Unfortunately, the queue was REALLY long. We went on the",
          "We were going to be in Nantes for a couple of days visiting family so we had planned to visit Les Machines. The spider and dragon had come to our home city (Ottawa) a couple of years agp so we were somewhat familiar with the machines concept. We pre-booked a timed ride on the",
          "This was the main reason we visited Nantes but we loved the city so much we will be back! We couldn't get tickets for the elephant ride, but pre-booked the Galeries, which was a good idea as they were full to capacity on the first weekend of the 'Nuits du Van'. Still had to",
          "Visited the attraction on a long weekend. The elephant and other mechanical creatures were amazing , the big issue we had was the lack of translation from french, a spork in English would have helped not just the brits but other Europeans who usually speak English. The queuing",
          "This attraction was one of my main reasons for visiting Nantes, it was good but too crowed. What they need to do is have a larger space then take in 30 people at a time and move people along each machine rather than move people back an forth.. I was told my ticket is times for 1",
          "An unusual and intriguing exhibition in a great riverside location . The Grand Elephant is particularly spectacular (and free to watch as it plods slowly around the site). Beware of the spontaneous water spray from his trunk. The rest of the exhibition involves various",
          "This is indeed an incredible place - you could plan a trip to Nantes to visit it! The imagination of the creators drawing inspiration from the world of Jules Verne has run wild. They started with the giant elephant, they continued with the sea monsters carousel and they are now",
          "this is an amazing place to see how the elephant has been designed and build, also the small insects that have been up scaled so you can see how they work, this is a must for all visitors",
          "Worth pre-booking the elephant ride online in advance as very popular. I can see why as it is a unique 30 minute experience. Access to the elephant is next to the carousel. We didn't get time to see the workshops.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our day here - and we had no children with us! We had booked tickets for the Grand \u00e9l\u00e9phant online and it is possible to do just that one thing. There is no entrance fee for the whole area . The Halles des Machines is great too, though- takes about an hour",
          "Pretty amazing visit. The elephant is awsome. Kids will enjoy it for sure. Its a shame all explanations are in French and no English is provided. Its iconic ao you have to go...",
          "I have never seen a place like this. You\u2019ll need about 3 hours to do it all justice, including 30 mins for the elephant ride. We tried to buy tickets online in advance, but they had already sold out. However, they clearly hold back lots of tickets for arrivals on the day. All of",
          "It's so lovely to be able to enjoy an experience that is entirely idiosyncratic to its home, and Les Machine de L'ile certainly fits this category. Fun for all ages, a not-too-expensive entry fee and some really fascinating and beautiful mechanical artistry. I'd never heard of",
          "Our whole family with ages between 2 and 72 - 19 of us altogether - visited this attraction in May. We all had a fabulous time, the elephant ride is an absolute must. We also had rides on the carousel which were just as interesting with the rides having moving parts which we",
          "We never saw such clever machines and animal statues. NOt just the elephant, but so many others (sloth, ant, spider, hummingbird, heron and more). The demostration is in french, but you don't have to understand it to admire the innovative and creational way they did here.",
          "Definitely not just for children, these amazing larger than life machine creatures are well worth a visit. It's an hour long if you stay for all the demonstrations, and although it's entirely in French with no concession to English speakers, it's a very visual presentation, so",
          "Only went for walk around but the mechanical elephant looks great fun to watch but do not know about riding on it !",
          "This ever evolving interactive exhibition is really interesting and occupies a large area. The largest exhibit at the moment is the elephant whch will hold just over 50 people. You can feel the vibrations of the elephants body as it walks. Other exhibits are insects and birds",
          "large space with some attractions \u00e0 la Jules Verne. Moderately interesting. the place to go with kids 5-15.",
          "This was just wonderful. We did the elephant ride, the carousel and the gallery where the new animals are being demonstrated -- and bought the t-shirt. Worth a trip to Nantes just for this. And actually one of the reasons I chose Nantes for a side trip from our month long",
          "This attaction is really good value and just so spectacular to see. Highly recommend it. When 5he staff do the demos of the machines it's actually quite unbelievable. 5 stars.",
          "I thought that the expo of the machines was very nicely done, only downside is that all the demonstrations are voiced over by the guide(s) and this is only in French. Well it's France so they expect you to speak french......however some of the boards in the exposition hall are",
          "Strolled to here from the city centre as we had read loads of great reviews. We were disappointed as the tours were all booked up for that afternoon, definitely pre book in advance. Walked around in the 31 degrees heat and got to see the amazing elephant. Definitely worth a see",
          "Les Machines de L'ile (The Machines of the Isle of Nantes) is a whimsical world. Inspired by the wildly imaginative works of writer Jules Verne\u2014 born in Nantes in 1828\u2014the park is an artistic wonderland of massive puppet and automaton machines. It is built in the covered",
          "At first impressions it is just a big open space, lots of concrete and lots of trip hazards - beware. The main building has the machine galleries and it houses THE ELEPHANT. This is just an incredible piece of Engineering It must have been a sight in the past when it was totally",
          "Visited this morning , disappointingly the merry go round was nit open till 2pm. The Galerie was fantastic, such a huge endeavour. Very enjoyable.",
          "Incredible machines... certainly worthy of a visit. Price to get in for adults - worth every penny. Looking forward to the opening of the Machine des Iles tourist attraction in 2022.",
          "A 'must see' if staying anywhere close to Nantes. You would pay five times the 8 Euro entrance charge, back in the UK. Star of the show is a ride on the 4 -story high mechanical elephant. A fascinating preview of the progress towards 'The City in the Sky' when all of the",
          "It's a Steampunk vision of a zoo. These phenomenal machines replicate the actual motion of the animals they represent. The descriptions and guided tour is all in French, but you don't need to understand the language to enjoy the display. Plan for about an hour for the gallery",
          "Very nice place! I suggest you visit guide with the history of the machines If you are interested you can reserve on the website the ride in the big elephant",
          "Where else in the whole world will you find an attraction featuring high-tech robotics and a giant mechanical elephant? Nowhere but here in the Machines de L'ile des Nantes! With the Nantes Pass (25 Euros for 24 hours, 35 for 48 hours), you can choose to enter the gallery for",
          "The exhibits that are on display today are only a tease of what is to come in the next few years. If you are interested in machines this is a great place. The park is also filled with actives for families.",
          "The kids and adults are still talking about their day here six months after the fact\u2014unbelievable. Incredible machines to ride and view. Wow.......wow.....wow....",
          "We visited all the machines. The gallery was very interesting, but more information in English would be helpful. Later we took a ride on the elephant, in was really funny. At the end, we visited the carousel and took a ride on the horses. This place was cool and innovative. A",
          "All ages will enjoy a visit here, to watch and see, the various machines in motion. Well worth a visit. Recommended",
          "This place is so cool! and I'm a 30-something-years-old woman... the mechanic elephant is so cool- you have to visit there.",
          "We came here on a Saturday morning for it opening at 10am as we had not booked it in advance spaces fill up fast with group bookings and it only comes out 3 times a day",
          "A must to visit even just to see the elephant. Excellent staff and gift shop. Amazing facilities in this unique building.",
          "The machines are a highlight of Nantes, you must visit. Be aware you can buy advance tickets online only for the first elephant ride of the day at 10:15am. This is well worth it as the lines are long and the ride itself takes 40 minutes. Your elephant ticket also allows",
          "Great thing to do when in Nantes. Really interesting to watch the mechanics of the animals. Great messages about saving the animals as welk. Arrive early so you can ride the elephant",
          "We missed the elephant when it came to London so were looking forward to seeing it in Nantes. We were put off by the huge queue but were lucky enough to arrive as the elephant was leaving the shed. It is an amazing feat of engineering and we got to see it in action for free.",
          "The machines are wonderful, such creative things are worth stopping by to check. However, the line is always huge and quite stressful.",
          "Sloths, prehistoric birds, giant spiders, all mechanized for viewers to see. One visitor was even invited to ride a giant inchworm. Children will love it as will adults.",
          "A great display of mechanical animals that are operated during the visit. You just wander around looking at the exhibits and listen for when the exhibits are coming to life. The mechanical elephant is amazing. Cost is reasonable but there is a lot of queuing involved as they",
          "In a world full of practical things, this unique place belongs to the worlds of dreams. You'll be able to see gigantic mechanical spider together with huge mechanical ants and other amazing mechanical creatures. This place is great for children and children in their hart! Don't",
          "Such a wonderful unique place to visit, literally the dream of two men come to life, and on such a grand scale. We visited on a Saturday and arrived at about 10.30 when there were only a few people in the queue. An hour later however the queue was long and slow moving so either",
          "Highly recommended . Unique place, especially Grant Elephant. only a few tours a day but definitely worth it, there is a line to buy the ticket, so plan your time before. Carousel is also very interesting.",

          "As my wife does not speak French, we passed on most of the (undoubtedly) interesting tour of most of the animal machines. but we did opt for a ride on the elephant. This is a unique experience lasting about 30 minutes when you can \"ride\" the elephant from the carousel to the",
          "On an Isle in the Loire River in Nantes, France; there is an enchanted Jules Verne (Nantes is his birthplace) themed carousel! These delightful mechanical sea creatures are animated with the help of their human passengers. We enjoyed watching each of the three levels and even",
          "The museum is somewhat confusing as the 'machines' part and then the elephant ride are priced differently (there is a separate but related carousel). The machines was all in French and somewhat interesting but not worth the admission. The elephant ride was fun and my kids",
          "Well worth a visit to see the spectacular machines already made, those in planning stages and more in production. You can even ride on some of them!",
          "We visited Les Machines on a sunny Sunday afternoon. We waited for over an hour in a very long, slow moving line. Once we were closer to the ticket area we could see the sign showing how many tickets were available to ride the elephant. And clearly there were way more people in",
          "This place is everything we had hoped it would be although we got there at 10 and at no time were told it doesn\u2019t open until 2 out of season. So be warned, don\u2019t get there until at least 1.30 and queue for the Elephant ride first as this sells out very quickly. You won\u2019t be",
          "This is quite a lively place especially during the weekend and even more so when it\u2019s sunny. The giants are the main attractions but the large area has some interesting parts as well. Floating restaurant, Jules Verne\u2019s looking merry-go-round, live music, etc Nice atmosphere.",
          "To people who like engineering it is a perfect place to visit! The machines use shapes of nature and they move alike so it is very interesting place to watch the prototypes",
          "I had the privilege of visiting Les Machines de Nantes last summer, one of the first places of interest which I saw outside of Paris. There was quite a wait to enter the main showroom since the previous group had not yet finished, so we were in line for a while. However,",
          "Because of refurbishment, no left luggage at the station. Walked 35mins to the exhibition, waited 30 mins in the slowest queue ever, get to the entrance \u2018no bags!!!??. No where to leave bags!!!??. It was a small bag!! Useless morons, the elephants could run it better!!!",
          "The exhibition, the elephant, the caroussel...all very beautiful and nice to see. But my word I have never seen such an ineffici\u00ebnt system anywhere. Tickets are sold from 2pm onwards and eventhough we arrived a half hour before. We still had to wait until 3pm before we could buy",
          "Wow what an exceptional place. The work and attention to detail is unbelievable. The staff were knowledgeable, funny and polite. The experience is one of a kind. You simply can't visite Nantes without riding on the elephant ! Oh and the shop is well worth a visite too !",
          "An attraction that you don\u2019t see everywhere, worth the visit! Parking and access is easy, the access to see the elephant, the carousel and the tree climbing (arbre des h\u00e9rons) is free, we only paid for the gallery visit.",
          "Unic in the world.... who ever goes to Nantes has to go visite les machines de Nantes. Absolutely awesome, gorgeous, very smart.",
          "The Gallery\u2019s workers were behaving extreamly unprofessionally and unfair, they let you try on the machines, but they choose who will go on randomly, so they were doing the heron flight and asked for volunteers, my children asked if they can go, but were told they are too small",
          "I visited the museum where the were demonstrations of the rideable animals (in French). The mechanics of how each beast moves is truly fascinating and beautiful. The video opposite the museum, and overlooking the workshop was very good too. Very impressive indeed.",
          "This visit made my trip. I had a great time and even rode some of the machines. It,s not just for kids, people of all ages will be hypnotise by the various machines. You will need 2-3 hours to enjoy this great attraction. I was able to ride the giant mechanical elephant and a",
          "Didn\u2019t really know what to expect as taken along by local friends..... totally enthralled by the sheer craziness of the whole enterprise...... Jules Verne meets Victorian steam punk.. Brilliant!! Only in France would something like this happen, praise be!",
          "My husband and I loved this place . Seeing the machines in action and seeing the vision for the Tree was wonderful . I cannot wait to come back when it\u2019s done ! They would benefit from providing some material in English , especially when explaining how each of the machines work",
          "Wanted to do this with my girls for a few years, elephant is amazing and goes very slowly for about 40 mins. We all got splashed!! Had to wait about 5 hrs to get a go but had a look around the area, played at the playground and had lunch. Glad we did it but would not go back.",
          "I'm sorry but we didn't really get the concept of this attraction. The park was fine but the mechanical Animals rather left us cold. Maybe it would have been better if the centre piece, the mechanical elephant, had been there but there was no sign of it. All in all rather",
          "This was a fascinating visit for us, it was only slightly spoilt by the fact we couldn't understand a word they were saying, all of the commentary was in French (obviously) and most if not all the information around was also in French. This was really unsurprising, and I cannot",
          "This has to be the most amazing place I've ever been! Steampunk Heaven! Not a cheap place to visit and worth checking that the things you want to see are working as they have maintenance days (the website has full details). Staff spoke good English though all the talks are in",
          "We had a fabulous morning exploring the galley and of course have a ride of the famous Elephant which is a must. The animal in the galley were also amazing and were ridden. In the galley the descriptions were in French but words did not add much to the spectacular sights. \u00a317",
          "OK let\u2019s be clear, the guide is only in French, as are the descriptions, but it\u2019s a unique way to while away an hour in a re- purposed shipyard. The amazing elephant was receiving maintenance when we were there, but looks like a blast - especially for kids. We looked at the",
          "Amazing-very interactive with so many extraordinary machines. We loved the spider and the hummingbird especially although the elephant is brilliant, astonishing and well worth the money to ride on. You will simply never see anything like this anywhere else. Maybe the carousel is",
          "Every time we are in Nantes, we make sure to go and see the elephant as it is simply a marvel of engineering. Children of all ages just love it! They travel just in front of it as it goes on its tour of the area and hope to be sprayed by the regular squirts of water from its",
          "They were large and fully automated, Take the chance to ride in - on them and become part of the machine, comantary is in french as you wuld expect but the staff do speak english",
          "From an abandoned shipyard to the creation of fantastic machines. You will not only see the current ones, but they will also share with you their dreams and next projects. Don\u2019t miss the elephant!",
          "Les machines is good for all the family and reasonably good value. The story behind the regeneration of the area is interesting and the ride on the elephant and carousel are good. Arrive early if you want to get a ride on the elephant as this books up - only 50 people are",
          "Just outside the centre a couple of tram stops down. Even if you do not go on the rides its a nice place to walk round. You will need to pay though to ride on the elephant and to enter the gallery of machines, the queues can get long to buy the tickets, it was August when we",
          "Wow. This place is amazing, quirky, entertaining and so well executed. The elephant is utterly brilliant. We loved the spider and hummingbird too. Brilliant!",
          "We bought a 72 hour city pass and the art gallery was included but just had to pay extra to ride on the elephant! The elephant was soooo big!!! Kept squirting water out unexpectedly haha. Got drenched at one point.",
          "Just watching these giants move around is fascinating so we didn\u2019t buy a tichet to ride on one. That seems a bit steep (8 Euro) but the money for the tickets does go to animal welfare sanctuaries. Worth the small detour from the crowds in the centre of the city.",
          "Turned up at Les Machines not really knowing what to expect and was greeted by the noise of an elephant from around the corner. To say I was surprised with what I saw would be an understatement when this huge elephant, a combination of metal and wood, cross my path spraying",
          "This was recommended to us and I was a little \"meh\" based on the leaflets, but we walked by and bought tickets and it was one of the highlights of our trip. These are steampunk machines in the shape of animals and plants and the highlight is a 6o ton walking elephant that 50",
          "We were only in Nantes for one day so didn\u2019t get to spend too much time at Le Voyage a Nantes. However, I would definitely return to see it properly. Based slightly outside of the centre, it is a former naval shipyard which has been turned into this amazing attraction. It",
          "Nice place and their machines are incredible work. We did not find any tours done in english at the time of our visit.. so we did not get the full impression of the place.",
          "Machine of the isle of Nantes: Les machines de l'\u00eele - is really funny, of course how it mechanically works is not funny but rather quite complex. It is made as realistic as possible to match a natural elephant. The trip is very short, but with kids it is always fun!",
          "Brilliant, wacky and inspiring and truly inspiring. A ride and a soaking by the elephant is a must. The thinking and design is first class as is the presentation. The future projects make this a visit to return to. The cafe to the north of the site is a good lunch stop off.",
          "Amazing place. Unlike anything you've ever experienced. Innovative and inspiring. However no option to have a tour in English, my conversational French not up to the mark.",
          "Did not have enough time to be worth paying admission, but worth going by to see the Oliphant take a walk and spray the spectators/passengers on a hot day.",
          "We took our four kids under 11 to see the Machines de L\u2019Ile on a hot Saturday afternoon in August. The queue was so long that we ended up making do with the carousels and seeing the amazing robotic elephant. The kids really enjoyed seeing the elephant tramping along spraying",
          "This is really something that is not easy to find anywhere else. I understood that this was created to revitalize Nantes\u2019 shipyards. The Elephant is really nice even if I have to say that apart from wetting the passers-by with a jet of water from the proboscis and having a short",

          "We visited the carousel after standing in line for about an hour for the elephant ride to discover that it was sold out for the day. It seems from other reviews on here that you can book ahead but staff on site told us this was not possible and you needed to arrive onsite by",
          "Nantes is a wonderful City, and following the green line round takes you from site to site. There are some great art installations and a highlight is the elephant at les machines d\u2019ile. The carousel there is amazing. Follow as much as possible as there are delights all the way",
          "We had the best time, we pre booked our ride on the elephant so didn't have to que for that. Was a great experience, we also enjoyed watching the elephant on its travels around the site. We also visited the gallerie. Very interesting, we couldn't understand the presentations as",
          "Really nice expo for young and old; the huge elephant is undoubtedly a must-see in Nantes. The 'Les machines de L'Ile' is part of the 'Voyage a Nantes' (Travel) and offers a mix of different works of art. Different animals are being shown and the large building offer a variety",
          "Where imagination becomes reality but but but awful queues to get tickets for the gallery (where they give a guided hands on tour) it took us over 2 hours. If you have children this is a nightmare. The operators really must address this.",
          "We loved the Elephant ride, great guide who was fun., a very interesting place. If you want to do the ride or the exhibition I would book in advance as there was no queue if you had booked but a very very long queue to buy tickets.",
          "when walking to this you will find yourself impressed by the mechanical elephant an impressive feat of design and engineering, you will enjoy the carousels which again are fun and interesting and my kids loved them but stop there. after this point I got a bit more",
          "The elephant in the room is...the elephant in the room! :) Taking the time and effort to get here just to see the Elephant in action is well worth the time and effort it takes to get here! The elephant is a really well thought out attraction, especially love the water that",
          "It's very hard to describe this place. It's kind of a cross between an exhibition, a playground, an art gallery and a theme park. A product of Francois Delaroziere & Pierre Orefice's collective imagination, this is the only place where you'll find Jules Verne's invented worlds,",
          "Structures are great, caroussel is a must try. You can even ride the elephant, or just stay around and get sprayed by its trunk as it yells at you. Impressive in a stem-punk way.",
          "Passed a lovely afternoon at the Machine De L'ile in Nantes. Situated in old town which is beaming with many different artistic displays in the street. The Elephant is brilliant and we all really enjoyed seeing it roaming about through the crowd. There is a cute outdoor bar and",
          "Although we didn\u2019t go on the elephant, the queue was massive, it didn\u2019t stop the enjoyment. In fact the kids dodging the regular blasts of water from the elephant\u2019s trunk was their highlight.",
          "We headed to Nantes nice and early, excited by the great views. Unfortunately what we had not realised was that people queue from before it opens and we were faced with a 2 hour wait (according to the information girl). We decided against it as we realised that we would only get",
          "Amazing display of incredible machines in a mix of Jules Verne and Da Vinci. It's very interesting for the people of all ages. We bought the tickets at the counter there but I would advise buying in advance, if you don't want to queue for at least 30 minutes. The staff operates",
          "Worth the visit just to see the Elephant, what a feat of engineering. We did not ride on it but just watching the way this mechanical beast walked it looked just like the real thing. Do not miss this if you visit Nantes.",
          "Be prepared to wait to buy your tickets or book in advance if you can get there in time for the first 2 ridesf the day, but it was a great experience.",
          "Found this place by chance on the internet as we were staying near Nantes. For 8 euro you can get to ride this wonderful timber mechanical elephant around the old ship docks. There is also a large merry go round and a gift shop on site. There is also a cafe next door.",
          "This was our third visit but the first with our 4 grandchildren aged from 3 to 8... they loved it and especially when they were sprayed with water... It is possible to ride on the elephant but it is expensive and there are long queues.... just seeing it walking around and for",
          "You don't actually need to pay an entrance ticket to get soacked by the giant elephant, but the exhibition of what the machined future will bring is certainly worth a ticket, as well as the merry go round. Incountournable if you pass by Nantes, which at itself is a very",

          "There are 3 distinct entertainments, the 'atelier de l'ile' is not worth the time and money. At first you are sent in a smaller hall where you only see a half finished mechanical spider and some left over machines and parts, you are asked to spend an hour in this place before",
          "Visit this museum, located on the banks of the Loire, and wonder at the many automated machines from small sea prawns to the giant 12 metre high elephant, taking up to 50 people for a ride. Wander round the galleries, take part in a workshop, discover a world of machines and do",

          "This is simple. Nantes is a city where you can't find all the entertainment in one place, you need to walk and discover the city step by step and is there that you will enjoy and be amazed of all the things the city as to offer you and the Machines de L'Ile is one of them. I'm",
          "If you are near to Nantes, you have to go here. Unbelievable feats of engineering and creativity. It's sad to see some negative comments about no English translation, I speak no French but you just have to use your imagination, it's fairly easy really. The elephant ride was as",
          "We stopped off in Nantes while travelling from St Jean de Monts to Morlaix. Had allocated about 4 hours to take in the Elephant and the Gallerie. Tried booking the elephant online beforehand...one thing you need to be aware of is you can only book the 10.15 & 11am rides online.",
          "We found the whole experience amazing! Our 4 year olds imagination was stimulated and we spent the best part of a day there. We\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this before.",
          "Booked and paid well in advance for a ride on the Giant Elephant...thought the kids would love the surprise. However, after driving for 1 and 1/2 hours to get there for 9.45am (for 10.15am ride) to find machine had broken down was, to say the least, a huge disappointment. We",

          "I cannot understand any negative reviews of this place. If you have a love of science and a high interest in new ideas & concepts, this place is nothing short of spectacular for all ages. Our 10 year old was mesmerized by the details & concepts so much that he willingly watched",
          "We visited hoping to see and touch the machines. Hosted inside a greenhouse with crowds. Not much to see, machines are impressive but slow and you are herded like sheep to watch the demonstrations. May be interesting once the tree concept has been developed but at the moment",
          "If Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci had a love child this place would be it! The engineering and craftsmanship of the machines these guys have created and their overall vision for future creations is spectacular. Can't wait to return in 2020 when their dream is fulfilled.",
          "This place was the old place were they biuld the boats. Its between to arms of the river and they use it as a \"tribute\" to Jules Verne. We saw the elephant and decided to have a trip (8,5\u20ac) that takes like 25-30 minutes. The amchine is amazing and in summer hot days, the trunk",
          "We visited hoping to see and touch the machines. But essentially it's more like a show with select audience participation. Hosted inside a greenhouse with crowds that will block the view and interrupt videos and photos. Not much to see, machines are impressive but slow and you",
          "We saw one of the \"animals\" at the Bay Area Maker Faire so we had to go to the source and it did not disappoint. What was supposed to be a one day affair ended up being a total of four unforgettable days. Playing with the spraying elephant might have been even more fun than",
          "This is art in an area of urban regeneration. It is ever evolving as people work on new pieces in the workshop in the centre of the reclaimed warehouse, and it's also great fun. Working mechanical animals move around the gallery during the tour, which takes about an hour (mostly",
          "This place is soo cool! It's full with gigantic steampunk-style machines of animals : elephants, fish , birds ,cameleons, everything you can dream of. Even if you don't pay a ticket you still have a lot you can see.",
          "I had no idea what to expect and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Unfortunately the elephant was not out walking, but the Gallerie des Machines and the Carousel des Marins were brilliant. With a Nantes Pass you get one ride included and a reduction on the second.",

          "Even as steam-punk lover, I can't help not liking it. It's 8.5euro pp to listen to a French description (good luck if you don's speak French) of the history of \"Les Machines de L'ile\" and see 2-3 mechanical insects/animals. They built some machines powered by steam, which are",
          "The elephant ride was fantastic, our host brilliant even if I didn\u2019t understand all he said not having had a decent French education. The machines were brilliant but the smallish exhibition only displayed a few, having said that the spider was awesome. Shop was good with some",
          "Had limited time in Nantes and decided that we had to see this place. We paid and entered to discover that a tour of the exhibits had just started. It was all in French and there were loads of children there. It was great to see them enjoying the machines. I was struck by the",
          "We did this on a tour with cruise ship. Got to ride the carousel which was cool. Saw the elephant walk the streets and went into the factory where they were building more machines. They were impressive and if you are in Nantes it\u2019s definitely something you should do but I",
          "So the elephant ride is unmissable. the website appears to only take bookings on saturday and sunday (what a genius idea!) so you have to just show up on a friday and roll the dice. We got lucky with a 3pm ride. It was 1130am, so we went into town to get a sandwich - probably a",
          "Great even for big kids! The lumbering mechanical elephant seems surreal lumbering alone squealing and squirting water. The young ones seemed totally entranced. You can pay to ride but it\u2019s just as much fun to watch from the sidelines.",
          "This is a must-see if you are in Nantes, with our without offspring. it's fun, educational aand although the commentary is completely in French that did not matter, you get the idea. it's hectic if you happen to be there at the same time as a school trip but it's not the end of",

          "What a find! Amazing...incredible...creative engineering...what an imagination...whoever said engineering was boring or uncreative? This is a must visit if you are anywhere in the region or even just passing through...whether young children or old children (adults)!",
          "We pre booked our tickets for the elephant ride via their website, and it was an easy process booking in etc. What a great morning out, staff as super helpful, their English is great too. Plenty of parking around and close to the attraction. The carousel is well worth the",
          "We bought two tickets, one to the machine gallery, one for the elephant. The commentary was only in French, but for 8.50 euros, I didn\u2019t mind. There were many uk visitors there, so I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t provide headphones in different languages...? We then went on the",

          "This is more a display of machanical animal shaped constructions that can move about and are large enough to ride on. The museum itself is overpriced as there's not much to see. However you can pay 8.50 euros and ride on the huge mechanical elephant which would be a novelty.",

          "We had an amazing time here. Watching the elephant was incredible but I didn't feel like I needed to wait in line to ride it. We did pay to ride the carousel which was awesome. It's so much better than it looks from the outside. I could have watched it for a long time. The",

          "After waiting nearly 10 years to visit I finally managed to ride the elephant and was not disappointed. I pestered my family for years about going but no one else wanted to go, finally this year they gave in and came, well everyone loved the trip and were equally amazed by the",

          "Only went to outside area and watched the giant elephant walk the street. We good and great to see. Was not really interested in going in to see rest of machines",
          "The elephant is the reason to go - I would recommend to call ahead to make sure the elephant is working except that no one seem available to answer their phones. The first day we got on the elephant, but the engine broke down so we were a no go. No problems getting a refund.",
          "Great adventure that stimulates the imagination. Ride the elephant and the carousel. We also highly recommend the gift shop. Allow three hours for your visit.",
          "It\u2019s was warm but good, busy but not too much so to hang out, go on a few rides have ice cream and soak up the atmosphere.",
          "Visiting Les Machines de L'Ile was one of the main reasons for travelling to Nantes and we were not disappointed. When the mechanical Grand Elephant lifts up its trunk and trumpets soulfully before slowly exiting the shed it is a near heart-stopping moment. I have never seen so",
          "Went here on the way back to England. Even though the elephant wasn't doing rides because of the weather -it was early March- we went on the giant carousel and my wife got to operate a giant mechanical caterpillar in the workshop. (It seems that instead of saying 'keep off the",
          "Very, very, very interesting attraction. I rarely see anything like that. It is like a Luna park, but with all machines. It is quite something I should say. This is definitively a must-see in Nantes.",
          "We rode the elephant and went in the gallery of the machines. I didn't realise in the gallery they would show you all of the machines moving. It was a real highlight of our trip.",
          "Very disappointed. Paid to enter and there was very little to see. Granted the elephant was gone for repair but aside from that it was still disappointing",
          "I like the elephant particularly, it is quite magical to see it walk and carry people, either from on high (from the magical tree) or by walking alongside it. You have to pay extra if you want to go on it. The other machines are interesting, especially the spider, the heron and",
          "This place has some of the fabulous folks working here and their work is just incredible! Some of their machines on display during our visit were an elephant, a dragon, a spider, a heron, a worm and an ant! The people over there were very kind and can speak in English as well,",
          "Only really worth visiting if the elephant is working. The rest of it is interesting and worth an hour or two but the elephant is the star.",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in the area. The machines created have the form of surreal animals and impress by their imagination. Great place for small & big children although it can get busy.",
          "Definitely sign up to ride the elephant! Our only complaint was the explanations for everything were only in French with very little English translations available.",
          "a magnificent man-made animal. You can cruise on its back and clearly all faces on board were overjoyed. You have to book in advance at certain times in the year, as places are restricted. Recommended especially if there ar young chidren in your party.",
          "I definitely enjoyed visiting this place, so many interesting animals and created created out of machinery and wood, so fascinating to watch them move. Amazing to see plans for the future as it is a site of experiment, research and fantasy. We could also look down from the",
          "Definitely the best of the Nantes public art Scene, Make sure to go there and wait to see all the outdoor robots. Mechanical elephant \"right out of \" Star War \" imagination. Fun for the whole family, couples or alone don't forget your video camera!!",

          "This elephant is amazing! I loved it. It looks really cool and is made exclusively. You can see its parts and how it works. But is even better if you have a ride on it. The most funny thing is to watch the reactions of the people on the ground, while you are at the top. The",

          "Julia was disappointed that when cycling through Nantes on her way to Spain (as you do!) a couple of years ago, the Elephant was \"en panne\". We thought mid-week in November would be ideal for a brief tour of Brittany in our Elise, and we could include a ride on the Elephant.",
          "We weren't sure what we were going to see really but it ended up being pretty cool. A little bit expensive for the rides which we didn't bother with but the machines we saw were really cool. Make sure you see the elephant.",
          "We had a great time visiting the site and took a ride on the elephant which our boys loved (6 and 8). We also visited the Galerie, but would not recommend this, it is the same price as the elephant. A small number of people could go on the machines and you had to watch with",
          "Walk over the bridge over the River Loire to L'Ile nantes and there are Les machines de L'Ile nantes - the gallery, the wonderful 3 decker carousel and then a ride on the wonderful mechanised elephant of Nantes. Makes for a super day out!",

          "Went to this place and for a family of 3 including the elephant ride it was E48 so quite expensive. It was really busy and i think you can just go to part of the open area without paying. The place looks like an old factory and is now used for these machines. They are great and",
          "Went to see this attraction in Nantes but was disappointed. We thought we paid to see all of the attractions but were only admitted to the carousel. One free ride included but you had to ride on the lower level in conveyances that fit kids not adults. The carousel was impressive",

          "No other place in Europe will you see this - automated animal-machines, for a meditative experience - equally interesting for children and adults!",
          "Great place but they give you the idea that these are machines that do more than they actually do, that the giant spider crawls along as it carries people, that the great elephant walks, that the centipede crawls along a tree trunk. They are all giant puppets: the spider moves",

          "This is THE thing to do when in Nantes. We walked from our hotel in the centre of town, which must have taken around 20 minutes, crossing the bridge across the river. It's easy to get to and well signposted. We arrived before the opening time of 10am, so were fortunate enough",
          "The Elephant is fantastic and the whole concept is brilliant. We had a ride on the elephant which is good but you really should see it moving first to get any decent photos. The gallery is so worth a visit and the other exhibits are breathtaking.",
          "The 40 ton elephant ride worth the visit, but as it moved around the old shipyards, little to see. So much potential to do something in the Hugh concrete space, available. It was Sunday so we could not do the workshop tour, and we loved the mechanical elephant, but some",

          "We hadn't bought tickets ahead of time to get on to this huge elephant so we joined the long queue (for 3/4 of an hour) and it was worth the effort. The workshop was also interesting but all was explained in French. The island is lots of fun and many creative things to see. The",
          "What is happening at The Machines de l'Ile is truly unique and anyone visiting Nantes really should visit to experience art and engineering in harmony. The short video in the Workshops provides a wonderful insight to the imagination, ingenuity and artistry involved in the",
          "If you are in Nantes for less than 24 hours then you have to see Les Machines de L'ile. What a totally fantastic experience, and quite possibly the highlight of my entire trip to France.",
          "We booked online for the elephant, the only time available was 10.15 which meant an early start for us, but it turned out the best way to do this. One of the kids wasn't too well, so we only did the elephant and the carousel, but the queue for the exhibitions tickets was about 3",
          "Excellent place to visit we took my grandson who is 6 and he throughly enjoyed the whole experience. Staff were helpful and friendly site was easily accessible but long queue for tickets.",
          "Spent an afternoon here. very impressed by the engineering of the rides, carousels and elephant. We couldn't ride the elephant due to technical difficulties but it appeared that most of the fun was on the ground anyway!",
          "The huge elephant, the machines and the fairground rides. It is something really unique, which you can not experience somewhere else. Great and crazy ideas you should not miss!",
          "I can see why this isn't everyone's idea of a grand day out as it's all slightly bonkers, but at the same time wonderfully bizarre and rather beautiful with its own Victorian/Jules Vern era style and elegance. Yes it is a little pricy to take the whole family but when you",
          "I expected a much better museum / exhibition after reading other travellers experiences... I was there in August 2017 and waited more then 30 min in a line... the final result was a 8.5 \u20ac ticket (more then 30\u20ac for a family) to see few machines in a tiny space. The concept is ok,",
          "We came several years ago and now it even more amazing! There s the big elephant and a lot of moving machines. It s reallay a pace to see when you re in Nantes!",
          "We saw an advertisement for this place last year and made the decision to visit on this holiday. It was amazing! Good value for money - a family ticket is two adults and three children under 17. There are 3 different attractions and all charged separately. The Gallery has",
          "So I didn't know what to expect when we arrived here. There was a fairly long queue (45 minutes) to get tickets and then you have to buy all your tickets separately. So one for the Carousel, one for the elephant and one for the museum, essentially 3 separate attractions all on",
          "We were excited to visit this attraction thinking there was lots to do. However it was confusing to know where to go. We walked towards the carousel area. (Very spread out so lots of walking). We paid for carousel thinking it would send you off afterwards into more areas to",
          "Jules Verne brought to life. Not only do you get to see all the animals moving, kids and adults can also get to ride on them. All commentary is in French so some language knowledge helps but is not essential",
          "We have visited only one f three attractions that are available there. First of all note that an \"elephant ride\", \"Galleries\" and \"carousel\" are all charged independently and all of them are at the same price which in our case ( 2 adults,2 kids) was 31 euros.If you want to",
          "Don't get me wrong, this is quite a gem. The machinery used for the elephant and the gallery is really amazing, hats off to Jules Verne but it's not justified for its price. First, unless you're a student or have some sort of discount, this is a very pricey attraction with the",
          "This is not your ordinary museum. Your ordinary museum does not have a jumbo-sized elephant trampling through its terrain. Let alone have people ride along on its back. Or a bus-sized spider crawling around. Or a man-sized ant. Or a massive three-level carousel filled with scary",
          "It's very nice spectacle, we just saw the elephant moving and was good. You can walk around these area and have an ice cream. It's a cool thing to do if you are in Nantes.",
          "We arrived around 13:00, and had to queue almost two hours for entry tickets for the Gallery and Workshops. Once in, it was a wonderful trip but, as other reviewers have said, the \"animated tour\" was only in French. The ride on the elephant was amazing, and well worth the wait.",
          "this attraction is just one of a kind! The Elephant is unbelievable and the carrousel des mondes marins is a great experience. I went on a ride on the Elephant 2 or 3 time already and a couple of time on the Carrouse with my nieces and nephews. They loved it and so did I!!!!",
          "I loved this attraction. The machines are so creative and innovative. It is still under construction when complete this place will be a true wonder. It is hard to describe, go a see for yourself I have never seen anything like this before except in films.",
          "Great experience even though quite pricey. Our kids of 4 and 7 years old particularly loved the Carrousel des mondes marins, which is a huge merry go round on three floors, each floor representing a part of the sea. Be careful: looks like we were lucky to only have to wait half",
          "An amazing place but I agree with several other reviewers it could be soooo much better with not a lot of effort. Yes, the mechanical elephant is truly amazing but by 2pm on the day we visited, tickets to ride it were sold out for the day. Very disappointed as we'd already",
          "Having seen the royal de luxe st theatre in Liverpool a couple of years ago was keen to take a trip to Nantes to see as this is also the home of the theatre. We picked a weekday visit weather was ok you needed to book tickets in advance I think for the elephant ride but as each",
          "We had an all round good experience visiting the Machines de L'ile. The creations are truly one of a kind and fascinating. I loved the unusual slightly macabre aesthetics and my partner enjoyed the technical side, so there's something for everyone. My only slight criticisms are",
          "Spent half day with the family on July 15. Visited the place and the carrousel. All good creative stuff but relatively pricey for a family of five to do the visit and then pay about the same for the carrousel. Still a must do.",
          "This is a must visit attraction especially for families but is also extremely popular with adults alike. Anyone visiting Nantes cannot fail to be impressed with this attraction especially taking a ride on the Grand Elephant. Up to 50 passengers can take a ride on the Grand",
          "Very unusual and well-made machines up close - a giant spider, a giant caterpillar, a big bird, a big ant... Also a 'City in the Sky' - man-made 'tree' that we could walk up, populated with a variety of plants and pretend animals / birds. Very enjoyable to see, but as the talks",
          "This review should be in 3 parts as there 3 seperate things to pay for: - elephant ride - Carousel - Gallery Each at full price is 8.5 euros. The machines are all technically very briliant but you get the feeling that you are paying for them to indulge their hobby. The",
          "Took a detour to Nantes especially to see the amazing elephant & other creatures. The elephant was wondrous both to watch & ride on, worth every euro. The museum tour was short but a good warm up, with roughly 6 amazing beast demonstrations. The tour ended with a short walk",

          "We queued for a long time it seems to be very popular, we arrived around 2pm and there were no elephant rides left as they only have 30 per time slot I you want to do this I would advise booking. The machines were interesting although the children were a little frustrated as the",
          "We visited the museum combined with the elephant ride. The museum is good and demonstrations were interesting especially that members of the public are allowed to participate in some. But the star of the show was of course the elephant. We were not sure if we wanted to take",
          "The machines and the nearby carousel are like a Jules Verne's book, so fantastic, full of details and imagination. Although I am not into mechanics I was fascinated by this place. The Elephant and the tree were funny and definitely out of the ordinary. Great shop (only French",
          "There is no doubt we humans as a species care way too much about stupid stuff. Building huge mechanical creatures you can ride around in is NOT one of them!",
          "Its a cool hall, and the machines are so creativ, the riding on the big elephant was fantastic, never seen",
          "We did not ride the elephant, glad we didn't. Only reason being was, we didn't have to wait in a long line, for something that moves extremely slow. We felt it was better & more enjoyable to watch it, rather than ride it. I absolutely recommend riding the 3 tier carousel. The",
          "It is situated on the island in Loir river. You can go on foot or by tram. It is not faraway. It is a spectacular park with a lot of works of engineering. Especially the elephant is superb. If the weather is good you can sit by the river and have a relax. Generally you will",
          "A mechanical elephant that adults can ride! It spouts out vapour from it's trunk as it moves along. A big hit with the adults and kids!",

          "We were on a one day visit to the city and hadn\u2019t realised that this was the home of La Machine, so hadn\u2019t actually put it on the tick list. However we thought that it rated a must-see once we\u2019d read up on local attractions. Well, what to say: This organisation is, it must be",
          "This is a place not to be missed in Nantes, if only for its uniqueness. We rode the elephant, although it is just as much fun to march along next to it!",
          "These are not machines. They are animatronic sculptures. They run on rails and wheels. This is an arts project. If that's what you want/like & you benefit from perfect French then hopefully you won't mind the ticket price. Otherwise may I offer a word of caution. This place",
          "We have been to Nantes before but the Machines de L'Ile is a new attraction since our last visit. We researched when to go online as the carousel only opens certain times and certain days. It is also a little pricey at \u20ac8.90 per person for two rides on the Carousel and another",
          "Good visit with a few friends, great for all ages. Talks in both English and French which was great to see. The displays from the machines were impressive. The carousel was also interactive and was cheap to ride. The entire island is a work of art. The Grand Elephant was out of",
          "Do not miss it and make sure you ride the elephant and go on the carousel. Also buy a tourist pass for value for money",
          "We rode the famous mechanical elephant and visited the carousel as well. We all really enjoyed ourselves and even purchased a print to frame when we got back home. Some great bars and restaurants close by too.",
          "We decided to visit after seeing a BBC Travel report and we were very glad that we went. The machines are true works of art and engineering. The imagination that has gone into creating the machines is really fantastic. We are already planning to return when the giant tree has",
          "This must be the miraculous machines jules verne might have thought of while writing his great adventures. Here in Nantes you can see a huge mechanical elephant, dive into the deep sea with a three level caroussel and see other mechanical creatures never seen before. prices are",
          "The machines show how man can use his imagination to develop and copy nature but not improve. A very impressive place to visit.",
          "Visited with my two young toddlers who loved the elephant and carousel. Awesome architecture in this part of Nantes too! The nearby moon trampoline park was a big hit with all the family.",
          "Wow. Just blew me away this place. The design. The incredibly cool machines, the sheer scale of things. Just incredible. I was blown away by the fun and the attention to detail. I have to visit again, didn't have time to see it all. So cool!! Highly recommended, try to go early,",
          "All the Machines are awesome!! It is impressive to see all the work behind them, starting from the amazing designs and finishing with the nice style. The spirit of Julio Verne can be felt behind all the machines! It deserves a visit!!!",
          "We came to Nantes to see this incredible exhibit This can only be described as part, museum, part science, and a lot of steampunk! Super cool! We rode on a 3 story mechanical elephant, watched young a boy ride an enormous centipede, and others fly on a giant bird, and ride",
          "Very disappointing and not worth the bother. Much better ways to spend your time in this beautiful city than going to see a mechanical elephant and the few other modest 'attractions' on offer here.",
          "What a wonderful day, it was amazing. Such a lot to do and see, great for children and adults alike. The elephant was the highlight of the trip,",
          "The highlight of our trip to Normandy. We were staying at Carnac, which was nearly a two hour drive from Nantes, and we made the trip especially for les machines. It was worth it. For the ticket price you get an hour in the gallery and access to the workshop, as well as a",
          "Just in the town, on the old docks, all in french, but the elephant ,,,, crazy, plus the biggest carousel",
          "The mechanical elephant is the centre piece and well worth a ride. Children seem to love it - a mixture of awe and fear.",
          "It is interesting for children but a little overpriced. Stuff are nice but the boutique is a little expensive",
          "Visited the whole area of redevelopment on the island - following the green tourist line. The museum lets you in on the creators' amazing visions for the future of the park. Several machines can be watched in action, with the mechanical elephant as the star attraction. We",
          "My husband and I visited this place as he's alway interested in mechanics. I went along for the ride (pun intended). We had to queue for nearly an hour for entry. It was worth it though. It was hard to see the elevating giant spider as there were so many people in front of us.",
          "If you visit Nantes then this is a must visit.The machines are incredible and are fascinating for all ages and the rides on the Carousel are all sea creatures and wonderfully fanatstic, like something from Jules Verne",
          "Les Machines de l'\u00eele is a place for families and individual visitors alike. It features very creative mechanical animals, a glasshouse with tropical plants, a carousel adults love and the elephant, a very elaborate moving structure. Access is very easy. There is a car park",
          "We drove down after a few days at the WWII sites in Normandy, needing something a bit more lighthearted. There's a fabulous car park right across the street. We arrived late in the day, about an hour and 45 before closing which is a good time, I think. We didn't have to wait",
          "It blows my mind to wonder how the guys first came up with this concept and then kept going until it became a reality. Down on the docks, this renovated warehouse showcases fun, interactive demonstrations of giant caterpillars, ants, spiders and helicopters. You can see the",
          "This was our third visit. Okay we chose the wrong weekend to be in Nantes. Long weekend for most of Europe and 33 degree C temperature. Doh! So, first time we went the elephant was out of commission being serviced. The carousel was in its early stages of construction. Heron tree",
          "Visited this attraction free as included as part of the Nantes Pass. Nearest tram stop is over the river. Helpful staff suggesting the best ways to see exhibits while avoiding the many school trips.",
          "This is an absolute must if you are in the area. Try to visit all three parts, the gallery, the carousel and the elephant but leave plenty of time between them. Ideally you need at least 1 1/2 hours for each part. There is a lot of standing/ walking. The explanations are in",
          "Walk by the different halls and museum-style building to see the beautiful sculptures and animal machines that can move. Loved the huge elephant and the spider, a must see!",
          "Great thrill to see this mechanical elephant moving around. Had a ride on it and although you can't see much of the elephant it is interesting to see the workings, surrounding views and excitement of the children (and adults) down below as it sprays water, trumpets and walks",
          "I've visited several times now and never cease to be amazed - whilst The Elephant gets much deserved attention there is a lot more to see here! When you're done, then a nice walk by the Loire off to the left of the machines is well worth it.",
          "We have visited twice on trips to France in our Motorhome. The machines are very unique - especially the elephant and giant ant! You cannot see anything like them in England. I was able to go on the back of the giant ant and move its legs and antennae whilst it was moving",
          "Definitely worth visiting while in Nantes. It is more exciting when it is a bit busier. We came really early in the morning and even though we did manage to take nice pictures because of that, more people would have added more thrill while riding the machines. Great nevertheless!",
          "One of the best tourist experiences ever. A friend and I were spending the weekend in Nantes and le grand \u00e9l\u00e9phant got our attention when we were doing our research before the trip. What a great experience! It is a marvel of engineering, within easy walking distance of the",
          "We arrived just as the mechanical elephant was leaving loaded with folks up top. How exciting to see it go. We then enjoyed in amazement the adventures of the other mechanical beasts in the old ship building. Unfortunately no one was working in the workshop as that would be",
          "After museums and fortes and chateaus this was a really fun break. We were traveling through France with good friends who live just outside of Paris (they are French). They had no idea of this attraction. We stayed at a small Gites and explored Nante. My husband had heard of Les",
          "Visited this attraction last year with friends and it was brilliant. Although I couldn't go on the elephant due to ill health, it was brilliant to watch our friends on it. Les Machines are housed in a futuristic type of air shelter. It's a ten minute walk from the tram line",
          "We have been a number of times, always a mini spectaculer. Well worth the visit. You can, at a cost, ride the elephant and your trip includes a stop at the carousel included. The attached \"museum/workshop\" is a bit expensive for what it is. Interesting but \"worth the entry fee?\"",
          "It is really fun! There is a carroussel and a big elephant and a spider! You can ride them and it is a really great experience to take you back to your childhood!",
          "This place is spectacular for the child and adult. This machines are like transformers, for me.......",
          "Incerdible when you see the mechanic elephant walk around. The carrousel is really a \"need to see\" and when you go on the carroussels sea/air annimals you are part of the machinery (in a good sense) ;-)",
          "It was just something seeing the elephant moving around. But it was just fantastic viewing the gallery and seeing all the moving machines, we were not expecting such an experience.",
          "This is probably one of the most visited and written about attractions in Nantes, simply because of its uniqueness. The Galerie des Machines is generally open 7/7 between the hours of 1000-1800, but best check the \u201clesmachines-nantes\u201d web site for any changes to this schedule.",
          "This is an incredible experience if you like anything quirky or a little Heath Robinson. The talent of the workers and designers in creating these machines modelled like animals is amazing. Take a ride in the elephant and marvel at how over 40 tonnes of wood and metal 'walks'",
          "We only had an hour to explore this attraction. The mechanical beasts were amazing. There was a lot of talking from the guides which seemed very informative but unfortunately it was in French so we understood little. Demos were good though. If you want to ride the elephant in",
          "We had a great time on the elephant and the roundabout. A fun place to visit, with or without children.",
          "A must if going to Nantes. The machines and elephant are fantastic to see and made exactly like they would have done in the Victorian era. So unusual with so much detail and quirkiness.",
          "It is a great place to visit on weekends with every age group. Children love it and adults have fun too. It is a world of fantasy and adventure and wonderful imagination.",
          "From the moment you arrive you know you are experiencing a one of a kind in the World!!!!! The walking Elephant so huge and real adults and children can enjoy the ride and then the 3 level carrousel, with rinding creatures full of details. When you go to France this is a MOST",
          "It's hard to describe this place. They are building huge and really cool animal-like artistic robots that people can sit in and ride. Very cool and worth the visit.",
          "We visited the site where the giant mechanical mamouth is on display. There are other exhibits too. The mamouth ride is cool, and it is a delight to see the children laugh and squeal as the mamouth jettisons water around as it moves. It is truly a wondrous machine to see. Not to",
          "The machines are very impressive that's what gives it the wow factor the elephant is one of the most impressive things I have seen, worth a visit to Nantes just for that, however the other instillations will be amazing in the future just needs time to develop further as it feels",
          "Highly recommend booking the elephant ride in advance to avoid queue & also ensure that you go at a specific time as only a limited number can go. Very good. Interesting workmanship. 30 minutes on elephant. Plenty of time to walk around. A great family day out",
          "Fantastic place to go. A must see! Make sure to visit both sides of the exhibition. Take plenty of pictures.",
          "We got there before it opened but the sight of the crazy wood and leather giant elephant parked outside, replete with a cab to ride in...tasty!",
          "An amazing mechanical themed attraction with a Jules Verne feel. The huge mechanical elephant was mesmerising!",
          "Nowhere else will you find such an abstract and unusual theme park. My sister is a teenage and was rather reluctant to go however she really enjoyed the carousel and the museum. A must-see attraction.",
          "Well worth visiting - the people of Nantes certainly know how to astonish and amaze. I would recommend that anyone contemplating a visit allows sufficient time because this is certainly not a place that can be absorbed with a simply viewing - there is so much to see, to",
          "I definitely recommend this in the weekend, in a Sunday to be more precise. The elephant is open to the public and it's interesting to see how it works when it's walking. Be careful with opening times.",
          "Great experience. Interesting to see all the mechanical parts in motion. Book in advance as limited spaces. Free entry to view workshop area a new projects.",
          "An unusual trip in a mechanical elephant, journey was 30 minutes and travelled approximately 1 km. Make sure you pre-book online at least 2 days in advance. The queues build up exceptionally quick and spaces are limited",
          "This place is a Magical Steampunk Wonderland, where we get to see the genius French creative mind at work in the creation of these quirky machines . Jules Verne would even be blown away. Never have seen the likes of this in the USA. A Must see!",
          "Rasy to get to on public transport from train station.long queues for visit inside, and for elephant Exhibition brilliant. Long walk in the sun to Carousel.Caf\u011b in main building not very good. Not enough loos around site, so go when you pass one! Was a fairly good visit but",
          "We went to this place when we were on holiday the boys loved it. Crazy merry go round and fantastic metal robotics. Parking a motorhome can be tricky and be trying to figure out the charges was a task, but 2 french guys tried to explain to me that I only had to pay up to 12",
          "Les Machines de L'ile are a bunch of animal shaped robots. Said like that it sounds boring and uninteresting but the reality exceeds the expectations. Housed in the hold hangars of the ancient Nantes shipyard, this mechanical heaven is, according to its creators, a mix of the",

          "It is a very nice place, we did not enter as we arrived in the morning and it was closed. Open hour 14h, perfect for late visit. It is very interesting for the kids, and very entertained. Do not miss it if you are in Nantes.",
          "In Jules Verne's home town, Nantes, this is a spot that truly reminds people about his novels. It's kind of a spectacular show that you can participate to, riding the giant mechanical elephant and watching the \"Machines of the Island\". Some people dedicated themselves to do a",

          "There were many interesting machines to view in the gallery. We also took a ride on the elephant, which took about 30 or 40 minutes to walk from the gallery to the carousel; it would normally take about 5 minutes to walk to the carousel from the gallery. I think it would have",
          "Going to see the elephant is a must when visiting the beautiful city of Nantes. It is so unusual and bizarre and like nothing I ve seen before. It is beautifully made and fun to ride in especially when the trunk squirts water out at passers-by. The thoughtful organizers even",
          "we had a very good day out and the elephant was amazing ,the price was good for the experience ,and the restaurant at the entrance served very good food at a very good price ,",
          "This is probably one of the most amazing places i've ever been to - the machines are incredible and the museum showcases them really well. Suitable for all ages, the kids loved the elephant walk!",
          "This was an absolutely stunning exhibit of incredible machines! The guides do a great job at explaining the philosophy and purpose of the project and how each of the machines work. I went pretty late so there weren't a lot of people.... This meant I got a chance to be picked to",
          "This place is magical, the elephant is amazing. You can just walk through the island. There are s lot bars and shop, it's a really good walk. There is also sculptures to be seen at night also !",
          "very expensive unnecessarily .everything was in French . i think is better to saw only with out ticket",
          "There is no way that one can describe the impact of a visit to Les Machines. There are so many fascinating full and over sized animated animals and mythical figures to see and so many opportunities for children, and indeed adults to interact with the objects. Everyone should",
          "By far 'Les Machines de L'ile' is the main reason to visit Nantes. You have to see and ride the Elephant with your own eyes to believe this is possible. We had a great time at this attraction, despite the October wheather. This attraction really deserves to be supported by",
          "A nice time for the little ones and also for the grown ups! The evidence that when there is creativity and financial support you can build a tourist attraction out of nothing and give a new life to old spaces that had lost their reason to exist.",
          "The elephant is advertised as the main attraction here. The \"machines\" are really amazing, especially the giant elephant which just happened to do his little walk as we arrived on site. This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Nantes.",
          "We rode the elephant, don't bother! Take pictures and follow it from the ground. Spend the money on the interior of the facility. Fascinating and worth the time.",
          "We planned a weekend in Nantes to see this exhibition during past summer vacation. The girls were chosen to ride on the exhibitions and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Hard to believe the exhibit has been running for ten years.. highly recommended...",

          "Cool place, would not recommend the demonstration area unless you speak French. There is not alot to see in this area unless you can understand what the guides are saying. The elephant ride looks like a good time though.",
          "Simply charming place.. If you love circus, Jules Verne, or just fantasy of artists, you have to see it. If you have children, you have to see it more than once :-) it is worth the price.",
          "A wonderful experience especially if you have children with you",
          "Absolutely awesome. These artists really create something memorable. A mixture between technology and art, great visionary world that it could become, price is quite low too, of course it's a long waitingline in the summer.",
          "It's a worthwhile place of cultural schools' visits and, also, of touristic interest.",
          "A good idea to have a park with machines that look like creatures from the movies..Its a great place for young people to see how films are made.",
          "Awesome.! Frenchest thing I've ever seen :) Giant mechanical animals to ride on & Jules Verne style roundabouts, think jeunet & carot melded with steam punk eco sci-fi, plus there's a nice safe wire grilled car park literally opposite, do not miss this.",
          "Very original and fantastic show of machinery and animals put together. The science behind the movement of insects and animal. A visit that will excite young n old I guarantee!",
          "a modern landmark and must see in Nantes. Kids will enjoy it\ud83d\ude09",
          "Amazing! Nothing more to say about this",
          "Incredible and unique display of animal like machinery. Definitely one of a kind and worth a visit :)",
          "Such and amazing place for the whole family, we didn't go on the elephant just watch causing havoc! Probably the greatest attraction in Nantes",
          "I love coming here watching the elephant screaming",
          "Simply awesome.  A place to visit",
          "A great family escape for a day. The machines will show how animals move and a story of the Jules Verne\u2019s book will unfold itself in many different places. \n\nFor couples and adults visiting Nantes for the first time for couple of days this could be one of the things you skip in case your schedule is too full already.",
          "Surreal and amazing. They'd sold out of prebook tickets so we panicked that we couldn't go BUT you can just queue on the day to get in (only queued for 10min mis afternoon in Aug). You pay to see a host of mechanical animals in action - \u2026",
          "Lovely way to spend the day. Letting the kids get wet by the elephant and walking alongside such a magnificent piece of mechanical wonder",
          "Worth seeing this one-of-a-kind attraction, a mechanical moving elephant. Surely mind blowing for the younger ones. There are other mechanical animals too, I heard, but never got to see these.",
          "2-3hour queues to get in! We didn't go into the museum. But we saw the elephant from the outside, was amazing.....",
          "A fabulous place, full of fabulous things invented by people with an amazing imagination. Can't wait to return to see the tree grow",
          "Overall a cool experience. You get to see all the machine they build in their workshop and is demonstrate. There were some funny sketch when they perform the tour but you have to understand French to get it... The elephant was cool, and pretty much the best thing here.",
          "Loved it. Such a unique experience you won\u2019t find in any other place in the world. Well worth the visit!",
          "Quite disappointing. Five mechanical machines, tropical garden and workshop. 15 minutes are more than enough. 8,5 Euro admission..",
          "The queue to pay was hardly moving so just took a wander outside and photographed the elephant and carousel. Amazing place. Visited in motorhome so the high rise car park was no good. Parked over bridge to right. 10 mins walk.",
          "It is a waste of time for tourists \"English speakers\": \n- the gallery contains animal machines which doesn't move unless the guide is beside it \" who doesn't speak except french\"... So we are speaking about dead machines.\n - The ticket \u2026",
          "Amazing project and challenge, a must-see and looking forward to the full park!!",
          "Amazing tour to see these mechanical animals come to life. The detail is so precise. Well worth a visit.",
          "There was a long queue and though we bought the Nantes city pass, we were not able to profit during our short stay in Nantes. The machines are really for small children, so a bit disappointing after a long queue. I only recommend this for families with small children.",
          "Very cool! A must visit if visiting with kids or youngsters,  but definitely a fun time for adults too.",
          "It is a waste of time for tourists \"English speakers\":\n- the gallery contains animal machines which doesn't move unless the guide is beside it \" who doesn't speak except french\"... So we are speaking about dead machines.\n- The ticket costs \u2026",
          "Not as exciting as it could be and all guides were speaking French. Not a great deal to see. Underwhelming.",
          "A nice place to visit, especially for children. I recomend you follow the elephant's route than go over it.",
          "So disappointed with the fact that they have killed 5 innocent cows to build the ears of the elephant, while at the same time they suggest you to round the ticket price in order to save elephants. \n\nThe park is going to be incredible and a good alternative to zoos, but animal suffering is not needed.",
          "A fantastic utilisation of an old dock yard. Had a lovely morning here. Would go again.",
          "This is an amazing display and well worth seeing. For anyone with an interest in things mechanical or interested in how things work it is well worth a visit.  My kids had a great time there and the carousel is a must. Its not cheep but well \u2026",
          "Great day out for the family. I loved the retro look of the carousels and how they were made with recycled materials. The elephant was insane.",
          "I can just call it the best show in town for Nantes.\n\nModern mechanical marvel with machines coming to life... Worth the visit for everyone.",
          "Fantastic. At long last we managed a ride on the elephant. Children loved being sprayed with the steam mist. 8 years in the making",
          "Beautifully crafted machines that you can get up close to and explore and even ride, imaginative design, wonderful attention to detail across all the exhibits, friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Inspirational stuff, well worth the visit.",
          "Such fun and great place if you love being amazed.",
          "I'm very disappointed that in the exactly day I was visiting the place they have closed everything just because of the rain. I completely understand but I cannot avoid my regrets. Still, the place is big and looks very nice.",
          "Overpriced, that's the main attraction of the city and the machines size is remarkable. But it is poorly managed and executed. They are trying to advertise it as artistic, which is not.",
          "Nice collection of mechanised animals that move in an old ships wharf. You can also ride the big elephant.",
          "A excellent attraction that makes Nantes even more unique. A must go to all that want to experience something that seems to come out of a book.",
          "Very impressive, presentation is in French, without speaking french you will be very limited in soaking in the experience - still worthwhile to visit",
          "An amazing place to come. The machines are incredible. Great place to show the kids. Pre-book for the first elephant ride of the day, make sure you do the carousel and the machine gallery. Could do with more public toilets but that's a really minor detail. A true marvel, like being in a steampunk book!",
          "The elephant mechanic after mice to look at however visit to gallery was not very impressive",
          "Very interesting and unusual.  We recommend pre booking tickets online to save you queuing when you get there.",
          "Very disappointing. Expensive ticket for very little actual content. Watching the elephant is more interesting than riding it, and it's free!",
          "Very nice place! I suggest you visit guide with the history of the machines \nIf you are interested you can reserve on the website the ride in the big elephant",
          "a great gallery with marvelous animal lookalike machines. a lot of fun and suitable for families and kids. but when I was there had a feeling they could invest more in the machines.",
          "Get an insight in the projects Les Machines de l'ile are working on. The Giant Elephant is just magnificent.",
          "I wouldn't say it's a must do if you're a tourist, I mean it's nice to see the elephant walking around and the other machines, but it's not exactly breathtaking...",
          "Loved it. My favourite thing was the Manege d'Andrea.",
          "Didn't pay to go in, just too many kids, but watching the elephant do its rounds, spraying water at the crowd to clear its path was worth the non-price of admission. \n\nInteresting modern technological attraction on the \u00cele de Nantes.",
          "Beautiful and unique place to visit! One of my favorite experiences during my trip to France. I recommend visiting the museum to get the full experience.",
          "A magical experience! Amazing work has gone into creating this park. Queues for tickets are very long, however, so prepared to be waiting in a long line for them.",
          "What a fantastic place to visit. A must if you're in or around Nantes.",
          "This is a must visit for nantes it is indeed a hidden treasure. only the first ride of the day on the elephant can be pre-purchased and I would recommend it highly since the lines are quite long. the elephant ticket also gives you admission \u2026",
          "7 euros for looking at invented machines. If you\u2019re not with kids you\u2019ll probably be dead bored.",
          "Fantastic machines but tourist stream management and ticket sale could be greatly improved. Will have to be when the Arbre aux H\u00e9rons will drag even many more tourists..",
          "Fantastic place so many things to see and ride on",
          "So cool for kids, also adultes !",
          "Great place for families and adults. Kids love riding the Elephant. Be careful, it sprays water out of its trunk! The line gets long quickly. It is good to go early, or get your tickets with the expectation of waiting a few hours ( which is fine because you can visit the other machines, get a snack, and play in the surrounding areas.",
          "Really creative and fun. We didn\u2019t go into the gallery - next time we\u2019ll do. The elephant will walk around slowly so you have good opportunity to take good photo. It might decide to blow water at you though \ud83e\udd2a",
          "Go early in the am and do the carousel first to receive discounts for the gallery then do the gallery and elephant. Mid week and early and queues aren't a problem. With a picnic and arriving at 10 you will be completed by 4. Grand elephant \u2026",
          "Mechanical animals demonstrated in a didactic way. Only for young children with tolerance",
          "Great fun , fantastic place to spend some time.\nOnly came to Nante to take our son to the university .\nWe will be coming back again",
          "The mechanical elephant was interesting but not much else to see really - rather a small exhibition!",
          "It was a amazing experience. We saw the giant in Leeuwarden and now the atelier. Every animal was clear to see even when it was busy. Birds flying, a catapillow crawl and a giant spider walk. We took the trip on the elephant and was a awesome! We had a great afternoon",
          "Fantastic. Allow 3 hours to do everything. Tickets for elephant ride available from 10am or online.",
          "What a place - truly magnificent and crazy in the best way possible - especially when you are still outside and an elephant comes in sight walking towards you. But not just the elephant also the other machines are awesome!",
          "Cool plase, Great for kids especially the elephant. Though not enough tours in English, only French.\nThe builders are doing terrific work. Cant wait until Heron tree is complete",
          "Very attractive place with animated monsters and you can have a nice trip on a giant elephant!",
          "The elephant was fantastic to watch parading around. We got there early on Sunday morning and headed for the carousel. It was so quiet that they gave us an extra ride. It really was fantastic. There is a Spanish galleon moored on the other \u2026",
          "An absolutely amazing feature to go and see! You will have to queue early for tickets if not pre booked but it is definitely worth the wait. The rode with the elephant last about 40 minutes and the staff are fantastic and our guide clearly loved her job. If you visit Nantes and don't go and see this it is a wasted trip!",
          "Machines are really cool, but there is a lot of waiting involved to get tickets and for the staff to operate the machine s one by one.",
          "Just OK, I wouldn\u2019t bother so much if missed. Small kids will like it.",
          "Very beautiful, people working there ire very kind, may be the carrusel I think its a little expensive but its cool anyway",
          "Great when everything is working. But that's not often.",
          "Worth the visit despite the queue. Incredible animatronics inspired by the Jules Verne universe, especially when they come to life. Overseeing them working on their future projects was also eye opening.",
          "It's amazing to experience these machines that seem straight out of a Jules Verne novel! The workshop is interesting for people of any age, and the rides are simply magical. This absolutely is a must-see here at Nantes!",
          "Awesome displays all around you - mind-blowing attraction - you MUST go!\u207f",
          "Definitely must visit, especially if you are with children. Pretty expensive - each attraction costs 8.50 \u20ac, but elephant worth it. Come with children",
          "Amazing creative fusion of fuctional art and machinery!\nI have never seen anything like it. \nAnd it was a wow moment when the enormous stationary elephant roared into life and walked out of the shed and around the park.\nYou can pay to see \u2026",
          "A nice place we spent there 2 hours , i suggest to add some info in english...",
          "Great place, the only problem that guide is French only.",
          "Loved the elephant, I like that you can go whatever the weather as you get soaked anyway",
          "Well worth a visit, be prepared to que at peak times",
          "Very impressive work by the artists. The place is a bit small and packed but it is worth it. If you're lucky you can even hop on one of the machine to try it out.",
          "Fantastic place! Poetic and fun for kids and adults alike.",
          "A great outing for kids in all ages, the mechanic elephent is amazing and the carousel is great fun, you can enjoy the place with minimum need to spend money,for me a must when in Nantes",
          "This is good, and it moves around too, which makes it even better!\n\nDefinitely come see this if you're in Nantes.",
          "This experience was truly amazing. Seeing the culmination of wood amd metal was truly outstanding.",
          "Absolutely astounding place and a fabulous day out for all the family- funny, entertaining, inside and out so not spoilt by the weather. Always something in development too so reasons to come back another time to see something new",
          "Nice place to visit",
          "Really interesting and impressive. The elephant was my favourite. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Explanations about exhibits all in both French and English. Just a shame that the website does not explain things very well - I didn't \u2026",
          "This is an amazing place of mechanical imagination brought to life and enjoyed by found and old a like.\n\nThe elephant is massive and quite something to see, listen too and run the gauntlet of being too close to the trunk and it's water \u2026",
          "Wow! This is sooo me \ud83d\ude01 I loved the connection of plants and nature with those amazing art-machines! Though the gallery itself is a bit small and somethimes the biggest examples are under maintenance, it is totally worth visiting!",
          "Theme park of mechanical animals inspired by Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci. Well worth the \u20ac8.50 entrance.",
          "A must visit go early to ride the elephant. Free serviced barbeque facilities further down the dock in summer",
          "Very interstung place. Impresive Machines !!",
          "Yung or old everyone gets impressed by the inventions of the machines! A must see spot of Nantes, the performance worth the cost and the walk of the elephant is super cool! Get info about the shows and the time you need.",
          "Amazing Julie Verne's experience. Paradise of mechanical fantasy",
          "Best fun for everyone, from babies to old People, we all can be a child for while.",
          "Not been in it.... queues often long.... but seen the elephant doing the rounds several times which is always a hit with visitors",
          "It's a small place and the explanations are only in French but it's still worth it and amazing",
          "Amazing place! So clever and so original! Children and adults love the \"creatures\" and \"machines\". Not to be missed!",
          "A ride on the mechanical elephant is the perfect end to a visit to the animatronic museum",
          "Giants steam punk machines well designed and impressive.\nTake your tickets in advance or on internet to avoid crowds and long lines.",
          "No need to buy a ticket (and stand in line for hours). Just walk past ticket office to the large square and there you will find the walking machine elephant!",
          "The elefant is awesome. The expetion is interessting and brearth taking.",
          "Our girls and us impressed. 5 year old very excited running ahead of it and avoiding the spray. We didn't ride on it but still had a fantastic time. The restaurant at the side of the building was lovely.",
          "The elephant is great. Skip the carrousel and the tour if you are not into art or machines",
          "Very nice place especially for kids to see and ride this giant elephant.",
          "The mechanicak elephant ride was awesome!",
          "An excellent and unusual experience, we definitely want to visit again. Being from the UK we felt it was good value for money. There is paid parking opposite and the staff speak English. Such an incredible mind that created these machines! A definite winner if you're a steampunk fan.",
          "Tres bien. Interesting mechanical exhibits.",
          "Magic creations, interaction with public very good. Only downside is that they speak a lot about the future, it's more a park under construction from their own point of view. 2022 all supposed to be ready. But it's already amazing now and worthwhile supporting the construction of even more miraculous machines.",
          "fun for kids & adults alike - see oversized robotized animals",
          "Plenty of shops and gift shops near by. Free WiFi spots. Lovely place with open areas. Beautiful architecture and parks to walk down. You also get to ride the machines around Nantes - different types of machines. There is so much to see there and it is lovely to have a long stroll around the town...",
          "This looks good online. BUT it's only open on SOME Mondays - the only day we could visit. Very silly.",
          "A must visit tourist attraction in Nantes!!!",
          "Very interesting place to visit. I can recommend elephant ride.",
          "It was nice and being very near to lake the over all experience was good.",
          "I do like the big Beasts, Nice pace to visit in Nantes",
          "Nice place with parks for kids in front of!",
          "Really unusual museum with a good balance of learning and entertainment. Wish we knew the elephant ride needs to be booked in advance/ in the morning - it looked fun. Definitely one of the highlights of our stay in Nantes!",
          "Very cool. Has kinda a steam punk vibe.",
          "Amazing place to wander around and explore",
          "Great place to visit with friends :) we spend there really nice afternoon...",
          "A different tourist attraction that even surprise adults.",
          "Amazing, but a bit expensive. I hope it will drop with time",
          "Nice to visit.  It's cool they put the machines in motion. Stay and watch the elephant. I wouldn't go on it, you have a better view of it from below.  With the entrance ticket you can also see the workshop, this part needs some work, very \u2026",
          "Elephant was so cool! Unlike anything I've seen in the States.",
          "I\u2019m giving this a 4 star rating due to the problem with queuing for the attractions. We joined the queue for the galleries and elephant but gave up after 15 minutes as the line had hardly moved. \n\nWe went on the carousel, which was amazing \u2026",
          "Seems excellent location but I had to drop rating  massive as at 10am 1hr cue to ticket office. Problem easy manageable by ticket vending machines (not existing) and separating elephant cue (high demand, low capacity) to exhibition cue \u2026",
          "Nice place to Go with your Family.The mechanical animals are great!",
          "The Machines are so hyped and mentioned so many times in must see, must do lists, that it has become a victim of its own success.\nThere are 3 separate, paid activities here: a visit to the Galleries which allows the visitor to see working \u2026",
          "The most memorable place during my visit to Nantes. The place is easy to find and there is a bike station nearby. It's a fun place for both adult and children and a heaven for those who love machine! The most awesome thing is the giant elephant robot. It's slow but it can walk and we can ride on it!",
          "this is a fantastic (literally) work in progress. brilliant imagination and superbly implemented. i can't wait to see it when it's finished.",
          "Not bad! The gallerie it's not that big. The elephant machine is rad thought and they say it's gonna be bigger in a few years",
          "I oei on our office ooorder andorderoo lipoooooooo Kool I have to I pkol it to  ione IPO on",
          "Incredible experience and totally recommend for kids and not so young audience as well!",
          "Interesting\n\nNot worth missing, que took about 1/2 an hour, vist time about 1 hour.",
          "If you're in Nantes, this is one of the best thing to see !",
          "If you're in area a must see. Fairly new and still growing. Local area a good walk around.",
          "Great place!",
          "Wasn't open when I went past at 8am,  looks good though.",
          "Fascinating place - lots to see and great to wander spotting the unconventional art installations dotted around. Amazing to watch the elephant ,- which might be more fun than actually riding it",
          "Top",
          "Simply mind blowingly incredible!!!",
          "This place full of gaint machine gaint elephant safari and so many try to visit the place",
          "Very interesting place. A lot of fun for the kids.",
          "You should visit :-) Also very good for corporate events :-)",
          "All talks are in French so it's difficult to understand if your not fluent in French. Elephant ride was nice.",
          "An elephant you can ride on. How nice",
          "FAN-TAS-TIC. \n\nThe place is amazing, the desing of the machines and the creatures is stunning and marvelous. If you get lucky you may get chosen to control some part of the rides (the ant's left leg for me) which is really nice.\n\nYou will \u2026",
          "Fantastic for kids. One big drawback; it's a victim of its own success. We literally waited more than an hour in line to get tickets. The elephant has limited spots, so by the time we reached the ticket window, the only available time to reserve was 3 hours later.",
          "The elephant is huge and there are other activities too and a good area a to sit and have some fun the elephant walks through the space and you can even get into the elephant and take a small ride. There is also a river in front of the il de machines where the city looks beautiful \u2764\ufe0f",
          "I would visit and see the elephant for free, as it walks around the public area, but having looked forward to seeing the exhibition and studios/workshops I would save your money, it was unfortunately a little boring. \nThe marine carousel is \u2026",
          "So overly expensive! But impressing",
          "This is a must-see.  The Elephant is jaw-dropping.  You could watch the carousel all day, and going on it for rides is great fun.  I can't believe I haven't heard of this place.  The shop also has awesome stuff in it.",
          "Awesome machines and very friendly staff",
          "Excellent facilities, good cafe friendly informative staff.",
          "The gallery is amazing, it is awesome when you can make part of one of the demonstrations. You will feel like a child if you get the chance to ride a giant ant or worm, or being carried by a heron... the elephant is insanely cool to look at, I don't think personally that the ride would be that fun.",
          "Ok, but overpriced. The elephant ride was ok  but better view watching it walk past.",
          "Loved the mechanical elephant, which you can ride on.",
          "Really nice expo for young and old; the huge elephant is undoubtedly a must-see in Nantes. The 'Les machines de L'Ile' is part of the 'Voyage a Nantes' (Travel) and offers a mix of different works of art. Different animals are being shown \u2026",
          "Great mashines... cool show... recommend to visit",
          "Worth visiting! Bravo to the amazing team! \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great place for old and young, carousel a bit overpriced, but the elephant is just brilliant to just watch or ride",
          "Mind blowing project.  Currently on display is 'action', a proof of concept.  This blows 'steampunk' out of the water - the machines actually work.  A dedicated team of skilled nutters drag fantasy into reality.  Looking forward to 2021 when things will get ramped up again",
          "We were there on a bloody cold day (the fog outside froze the eyebrows of my gf) but it was so worth it, the machines are really something unique to look at.\n\nI'd give 5 stars if it wasn't for the relatively long queue in freezing temperatures.",
          "Went for the elephant...saw the elephant... can't complain.",
          "It was a different place to visit and it was quite entertaining.",
          "Unusual attraction, several walking or moving machines. Really only any good if you can understand rapid French, as nothing is translated. Ride on the elephant is excellent though, in any language",
          "Very interesting visit at the machines company. The gallery is the most interesting place to see.\nI really expect their tree project now",
          "Cool experience. Staff makes the machines move and if you're lucky, you score a ride. Fascinating engineering at a cool venue. Smaller than expected though and with the storytelling rather something for children.",
          "A must-see, absolutely awesome for the whole family",
          "Great for kids. So many activities!",
          "What an experience. We all enjoyed it. Not cheap but worth the trip, the elephant is amazing. The carousel was a bit much for one ride, \u20ac40 for 3 adults and 3 children.",
          "Incredible, unbelievable, an absolute MUST! Congratulations to the master minds behind it.",

          "Best place to visit with children\u2019s. when I visited I missed elephant ride due to non functioning",
          "Be selective about the 3 attractions:\n1. The workshops are quite small, and there are 3 main animal builds. When you go across to the main workshop there is an aerial platform to view the main workshop, that's it!\n2. The elephant ride, \u2026",
          "Really cool concept but as a non-french speaking tourist, I couldn't understand the museum demonstrations. I can imagine the whole area being a little more lively on a weekend, so it could be nice to go on the carousel and just watch the elephant ride by rather than pay to go into the museum.",
          "'Les machines de l'\u00eele' is one of the top spots you should go when you travel to Nantes. It's an artistic world based on the machines invented by Jules Verne and Leonardo da Vinci. You can interact with many of the machines that are \u2026",

          "If you go on holiday anywhere in Brittany you must visit the Machines. Jules Verne inspired, the trip on the 50ft high steampunk elephant is amazing, and combined with other mechanical animals, the carousels and even the bio-mechanical tree, this can keep the family occupied for the whole day!",
          "Impresive place, made like from Jules Verne stories. It's still not done untill the end as it should be, but it's already very impressive.",
          "It's kind of the icon of Ile de Nantes after the work done by Alexandre Chemetoff ! A really cool place for all ages to discover ! Waiting queue time is long on weekends and in summer but it's worth the visit ! The urban space around the Machines de l'\u00eele is very nice too ! A Must visit",
          "It was nothing to do and to see except big elephant",
          "Really cool place to visit, especially for steam punk lovers! You can have a ride on the animals and they change through the year! Prices for gallery and rides are affordable even if for the rides there s to reservate",

          "It's pretty cool man!",
          "Stunning experience well worth a visit. Extraordinary machines and the mechanical world of the future.  The only limit is your imagination",
          "I mean is a nice place but a the only thing that is worth the price is the elephant. Paying for seeing some machines pulled up by some cranes is not so great, moreover, when you wait in a line for 45 minutes. I wouldn't go again.",

          "This place was the old place were they biuld the boats. Its between to arms of the river and they use it as a \"tribute\" to Jules Verne. We saw the elephant and decided to have a trip (8,5\u20ac) that takes like 25-30 minutes. The amchine is \u2026",

A must do in Nantes, and don't forget to take a ride on the elephant, which is a long ride but very nice to see the city and to appreciate the mechanics and machines that are able to be made.",
          "Interesting displays of larger-than-life animals. Great for families. But beware, if you don't know French, it will be difficult for you to follow what's happening with the demonstrations.",
          "Amazing, we can make a lot of cool photos and the animal machines are amazing !",
          "Fantastic attractions for families. My 4 year old who is quite interested in animals loved the machines, especially the elephant.",
          "Nice to see. I felt it was over priced. Did not allow for international visitors. Only spoke  French.",

          "An incredible space converted into a quirky workshop with animatronic animals (which kids can ride on, using levers to move the arms, legs, wings, etc). But the highlight is the gigantic wooden elephant which is not to be missed when going on one of its daily strolls and spraying the assembled followers with its trunk!",
          "Did not get the chance to ride the big elephant. Make sure you arrive early.",

          "Very interesting especially for kids. Regretfully all the explanations are in French only",
          "Blown away by the Giant Elephant...worth waiting until it started moving! What an unique place, nice one Nantes!",
          "It's cool spectacle, but I think can be better, the carrusel has only one trip, could be more spectacular, the machine show it's very interesting, the shop need more items how represent the show",

          "To start-- book ahead of time if you think you want to ride the elephant. We knew we just wanted to watch so had no problems. Read the other reviews and consider what you like and don't like and whether the price makes sense for you. You \u2026",

          "Nice place, really interesting for all ages. Go without hesitation.",
          "The water spraying mechanical elephant was a joy to see and there was a very exciting athmosphere here.",
          "It's good. Especially for kids because you can make them learn new things directly. Practical things are really good for them. The price is approx 13.5\u20ac for carroussel and the museum but at the carroussel you can only ride 1 tour.",
          "Quite awesome to watch the giant mechanical elephant in motion complete with moving eyes and the occasional squirt of water from his truck \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Just wonderfull wonderfull place. It is like straight for Joules Vern fantasy. Mooving sculptures,real makers around and The majestic Elephant! Wow! I happened to be able to ride an Elephant on thursday 2:00 PM. Not sure if elephant \u2026",
          "Very cool, especially if you like steampunk or Jules Verne. But don't overestimate the time you need here. \"park\" is a little overstated.",
          "An absolute must see if you are in Nantes. The machines are beautiful, elegant, otherworldly creations. You can even ride the elephant - although for the price and the short ride time I didn't find it to be worth it , unless perhaps you have children who would enjoy it.",

          "We had an amazing time there. Got utterly soaked by the elephant. It was a great day!",
          "Really amazing, short video to explain the area and what go expect then go see the pieces. We were unlucky with queues for everything. Still enjoyed it though.",
          "Amazing thing to do in nantes.",
          "Fun and beautiful!",
          "The carousels were different and fun. The elephant didn't come out of the shed in the 2 hours we were there on a Saturday which was disappointing. It was also very hot today with not much shade or places to sit.",
          "We just watched the elephant - it was amazing, our son is a bit young for the museum but he thoroughly enjoyed watching the elephant",
          "Disappointing, not worst the time nor the money. Vrry small and poor exhibition, explanations not relevant for tourists who do not speak french...",
          "What a mesmerising trip down these artists' fantasy world! At the edge of creepy, definitely magical.",
          "Huge mechanicle artifacts. Possible to ride on a mechanical elephant over 20ft tall and a carrasel consisting of automatons instead of tradition horses. Also has meseum. Well worth a visit if in Nantes.",
          "Great exhibition, explanations by the engineering team in a humorous way, very unusual machines",
          "The kids really enjoyed seeing the elephant",
          "Absolutely unique. An expression of imagination brought to life in a powerful way. A must see.",

          "The Isle of the machines is an exceptional idea on paper, a park with creatures based on Jules Verne and Da Vinci's visions, sadly the execution of that idea could have been significantly better. For starters the park is small, imagine a \u2026",
          "This is so absurdly wonderful a project that I was very thrilled to learn about and visit. It's probably not for everyone, but my inner geek enjoyed it greatly!",
          "Great for a day to look around and get a feel for the machines, the carousel is really unique and worth going on",
          "Boring for me but great for kids",
          "Small exposition with only one machine running at a time with long wait between machines. Not worth the cost or wait.",
          "Fantastical, awesome mechanical beasts.",
          "It is very good but I would advise you to ring or email ahead to see if the elephant is working on the Day",
          "This was amazing. The kids loved it. A great peice of work.",
          "Take a day to go here.  Don't miss out on the carousel and try to get on the elephant although watching this thing move is quite majestic.",
          "It was an amazing experience to look at the huge moving machine elephant.",
          "queues are quite long but they are well worth the wait. this is and amazing place that will have you taken aback!",
          "Amazing. So much imagination went into this picking space. I thought it was incredible.",
          "Very impressive worth a visit.",
          "The park is incomplete. I also highly discourage from waiting in the line for tickets. I waited over an hour on a quiet weekday and still didn\u2019t get tickets. Instead I walked around and bumping into the walking elephant on its journey.",
          "Atypical and inspired by Jules Verne's world",
          "A great day out, huge working machines the elephant alone is about 50 feet high and walks about the ground's, you can ride on it! They are also building a mechanical tree where you can walk through the branches with animated creachers in the branches, all in all a good family day out any time of the year.",
          "Amazing place look forward to returning in a few years when the huge crane tree is constructed",
          "This is an amazing project. However I am giving 3 stars for two main reasons: the first one is the endless queue for the tickets. There is no other way to purchase them and it gives direct access to the galleries, so if you travel with \u2026",
          "Disappointed after big queue for tickets that elephant ride sold out and that after paying to enter the gallery that the children couldn't go on any machine at all. This is quite misleading as brochures and website show children on \u2026",
          "A.very good blace",
          "Wonderful walked around for over an hour, you can see everything for free, but rides and the museum cost money.",
          "It's cute. \"Back to the future\" feeling with crazy machines running on 19 century technology.",
          "Brilliant, interesting but go early to avoid the queues they start about half an hour before opening time.",
          "Good place for children",
          "If you're in Nantes, you should go here and ride the elephant, which was the best part in my opinion. Also, it's not too far from the Les Anneux, which are an art display on the Loire River.",
          "You can not ride every day.",
          "You cannot miss this if you are in Nantes. A fascinating visit.",
          "Having seen the giants in Liverpool and the fabulous maritime carousel in Brussels a visit to the birth place of these superb pieces in the old shipyards of Nantes is a must and especially a ride on the elephant or even getting a soaking from it as it walks around the yards.",
          "A must visit place in Nantes!",
          "Expensive to do the rides but cool to just watch!!",
          "A must visit when close.  Loved watching the kids getting sprayed in the heat .",
          "most incredible machine experiance ever!! must must ride the elephant and get sprayed with his trunk!! might be worth getting an english translator for the talks as all in French!",
          "One of the best attractions I've visited...",
          "Even as steam-punk lover, I can't help not liking it. It's 8.5euro pp to listen to a French description (good luck if you don's speak French) of the history of \"Les Machines de L'ile\" and see 2-3 mechanical insects/animals. They built some \u2026",
          "Interesting mechanics and fun for children.",
          "Really enjoyed my trip to Nantes. This was definitely a highlight!\n\n The mechanical elephant was spectacular. It was interesting looking around the workshop at all the new things they are going to build. I really want to come back when they have finished the steel hanging garden.\ud83d\ude0a",
          "A cyberpunk Jules Verne wonderland. A MUST SEE",
          "Really the best recognised place in Nantes city. All kinds of things to do there for kids and for grown-ups. If chance, definitely go ride the mechanical elephant, also the showeroom of the future plans are amazing.",
          "Incredible Art place where nature and steel mix in a feeric way never seen elsewhere.",
          "Really cool art/tech. Definitely worth a visit",
          "There's nothing quite like this anywhere else in France! Worth a trip. Les Machines are one of many intriguing things to see on the island of nantes.",
          "Brilliant day out. Wish we had more time to visit again.",
          "Great fun day out. The huge elephant is the star attraction. Arrive early to ensure tickets, you can only pre book on a very few times/rides. Restaurant on site very good, fast service.",

          "great stop for the kids!",

          "Worth going into the museum to see all the machines being demonstrated",
          "Extraordinary and unique experience. Take a ride on the elephant and see how imagination of Jules Verne will be brought to life",

          "Excelent and very interesting!",
          "This has to be seen to be believed, wonderful machines in the style of joules vern. You pay to ride on things and enter the workshop, but if you want you can have a free wander around. There is a reasonably priced multi story car park \u2026",
          "My children loved it.",
          "It was way over priced. The elephant was expensive but acceptable . The machines at 30 Euro for for was a joke. Only in French (which we spoke  badly) no translation available. The workshop was a loke able to look down on slow action from 2 or 3 floors.",
          "It's much more fun to walk infront of the elephant than riding it!!!",
          "Lovely but pricy if you want to do everything",

          "A fantastic experience for both children and adults ! Would recommend a visit",

          "Cool",
          "Amazing for kids, OK for adults. The galleries have very little information in English and all the presentations are completely in French. That makes it hard to follow for kids not understanding French. The elephant is a highlight, but there's other cool stuff in the galleries!",
          "Worth queuing for. However, if you don't speak French, there is no real explanation in other languages, so you are left with the visuals only. Still quite wonderful though. A must if you are into Steampunk.",
          "Good animal machines or animal robot Elephant",
          "Visually amazing pieces of moving art, if you get to go, ride the elephant, a great day out",

          "Educating and fun.",
          "Nice machines unfortunately it was not open",
          "Well worth the hour wait to buy tickets into the gallery to see the \"machines\" in action. The biggest drawback (except for the huge queue to buy tickets..only 2 people actually serving!) Is the talks and descriptions are all in french even though they will ask which country you are from.",
          "Must visited place in Nantes had good history. Go and enjoy.",
          "It's a really lovely and awesome area\nIt has some awesome structures and spots to check out\nFor example, there's big mechanical elephant \nThere's the carousel , big glown circles on the river that are breath-taking at night time.\nIn \u2026",
          "Interesting place, but I felt a bit stupid as all of the demonstrations were in French, and they spoke for a really long time. I\u2019d suggest maybe handing out a small booklet with transcripts in English and other languages.",
          "Fantastic day and wonderful experience. Highly recommended. You must also walk along the river to see the great street art",
          "Amazing mechanical elephant. We only saw the elephant and a horse. Not sure if the mechanical spider is constructed yet. But we didn't see it",
          "That is amazing! If you are travelling by car- get early! Parking is very busy.",
          "Nice place to check out if you have time. Especially fun for children.",
          "A wet day but the machines are well worth seeing. Try it as part of a half days cycling following the green line",
          "We had a great time, the price is very fair compared to the extortionate price you'd pay for the same in England. They could do a little more with the space that they have but I'm sure that will come in the future. Worth the trip for the Great Elephant alone but don't bother riding it, it's better to watch from the ground.",
          "Massive queues, and only half the ticket offices open. Well worth a visit, but try to arrive early.",
          "Best attraction in town",
          "Very unusual.",
          "I like the concept of this museum but its unfortunate that we waited nearly an hour to buy tickets just to discover that most of the machines weren't working. My impression was that you could try them (the spider, the inchworm, the bird) \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Temple du Marais, sometimes known as the Temple Sainte-Marie, or historically, as the Church of Sainte Marie de la Visitation, is a Protestant church located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, in the district of Le Marais at 17 Rue Saint-Antoine.  It was originally built as a Roman Catholic convent by the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, whose sisters were commonly called the Visitandines. The church was closed in the French Revolution and later given to a Protestant congregation which continues its ministry to the present.  The closest m\u00e9tro station is Bastille    \n\n\n== Catholic Convent ==\n\nThe Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary was founded in 1610 by Saint Francis de Sales and Saint Jane de Chantal in Annecy as a Catholic religious order of nuns. It started a convent in Paris in 1619 which built the current church and the crest of the order still surmounts the rose window above the entrance.  The building was designed by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart in 1632, in the Baroque style.  The church's benefactor, No\u00ebl Br\u00fblart de Sillery, an admirer of the Pantheon in Rome, desired a centralized plan.  Mansart, no doubt also influenced by the chapel of the Ch\u00e2teau d'Anet, delivered a highly original design with eight interconnected subsidiary spaces surrounding the central 44 feet (13 m) dome including the sanctuary to the south, the vestibule to the north, three chapels, two sacristies, and the nuns' choir to the west.  The design for the exterior was also quite original with the street elevation's three components, the arch with its Michelangelo inspired portal and projecting cross, the toit \u00e0 l'imp\u00e8riale with its lantern, and the cross-topped spire, drawing the eye heavenward.  The building's construction was overseen by the master mason contractor Michel Villedo.Saint Vincent de Paul served as the spiritual director of the convent for twenty-eight years.  The church crypt, finished in 1665, was the family mausoleum of Nicolas Fouquet, Superintendent of Finances for Louis XIV, whose remains were transferred to Paris a year after his death.  The church is also home to the tomb of Henri, Marquis de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, husband of noted writer Marie de Rabutin-Chantal.In 1790 during the French Revolution the convent was seized, its furniture sold, and the building converted into storage for books seized from immigrants.  In 1792 the sisters were expelled and the Society of Friends of the Law, led by the courtesan Theroigne de Mericourt, used the chapel for meetings.  In 1796 the buildings were sold and all were later demolished apart from the chapel during the creation of the Rue Castex in 1805.  The Revolution left its mark on the chapel in the form of a Phrygian cap above a door.After the Revolution the sisters reconstituted their convent as the Monast\u00e8re de la Visitation at 68 avenue Denfert-Rochereau where it continues to the present day.  The remains of the patron of the convent, No\u00ebl Br\u00fblart de Sillery, as well as of Bishop Fr\u00e9miot (Archbishop of Bourges and brother of Jane de Chantal) were removed to the new location in 1836 rather than leave them in a Protestant church.\n\n\n== Protestant Church ==\n\nAfter the Concordat of 1801 the church was turned over, along with Saint-Louis-du-Louvre and the chapel of the Pentemont Abbey, for the use of Reformed believers in Paris who had been forced to worship in secret or in the chapels of foreign embassies since the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.  The first time that Pastor Paul-Henri Marron preached in the new church he remarked on how Protestants could now worship in freedom and security nestled between such symbols of the oppression of their forebears, the Bastille and the home of the Jesuits in the Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne.The church was home to the famed city planner Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann and architect Victor Baltard during their student days at Coll\u00e8ge Henri IV.  While Baltard was a Lutheran he went with his more radical Protestant peers to the doctrinally stricter Calvinist church.  In 1830 the church held the state funeral for Benjamin Constant.The building was damaged in May, 1871 by fierce fighting at a barricade directly in front of the church during the Paris Commune.  Restoration work was undertaken in 1874 by Marcellin Varcollier and the statues on the pediment of charity and religion were carved by Ernest-Eug\u00e8ne Hiolle.  The church's organ was built by Joseph Merklin in 1895 with additional work by Haerpfer in 1960 and Heddelin in 1992.Elis\u00e9e Lacheret became the pastor of the church in 1902 moving from the more theologically liberal l'Oratoire to the more evangelical Temple du Marais.  As president of the permanent commission of the Reformed Church he played an important role during the debate that led to the La\u00efcit\u00e9 policy that separated church from state in France in 1905.  A plaque in the church commemorates his role in assuring the free practice of religion as well as in organizing the Eglises R\u00e9form\u00e9es Evang\u00e9liques, the evangelical wing of the Reformed church.  During the World Wars the church crypt was used as a shelter from bombardment and under the German occupation of France during World War II the organ was used to hide Jews.The church continues as part of the United Protestant Church of France and has experienced a great revitalization in recent years going from a handful of congregants in 2004 to 300 weekly attenders, most under the age of 40, today.  There are French services at 10:30am on Sundays, an African community service (in French) at 1:00pm, a Japanese service at 4:00pm, and an Arabic service at 6:00pm.  The congregation also holds many activities throughout the week including prayer and Bible study groups.  The church is open to tourists on Saturday afternoons from 3:30-5:30pm and volunteers provide tours.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of early modern period domes\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChurch website in English\nVideo of the church's architecture\nAn art performance in the church during Nuit Blanche 2010",

        "wiki": "Guy B\u00e9hart-Hasson (French: [bea\u0281]; 16 July 1930 \u2013 16 September 2015), known as Guy B\u00e9art, was a French singer and songwriter.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nB\u00e9art was born Guy B\u00e9hart-Hasson (originally spelled B\u00e9har-Hassan) in Cairo, Egypt to Lebanese Jewish parents, Am\u00e9lia (Taral) and David B\u00e9hart-Hasson. His father's work as an accountant and business consultant saw the family move frequently, leading to a childhood spent in France, Greece, and Mexico, in addition to Egypt. His family settled in Lebanon where he did his secondary studies, between ten and seventeen years old, age at which he obtained his French baccalaureate in elementary mathematics at the International College of Beirut, where his interest in music developed to the point that he left for Paris to study at the \"\u00c9cole nationale de musique\". In addition to music, he also obtained a degree in engineering.\nWhen his father died in 1952, the young B\u00e9hart chose to pursue a career in engineering in order to help support his family, studying at the prestigious \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es. Simultaneously, however, he enrolled in Paris's \u00c9cole nationale de musique, studying violin and mandolin, and in his spare time wrote songs and worked the Paris cabaret circuit, where he played guitar and sang under the stage name \"Guy B\u00e9art\". When a version of one of his songs by a popular performer of the day became a huge success, demand for his writing talents increased and he composed for Juliette Gr\u00e9co and others. Taken under the wing of renowned music producer Jacques Canetti and fellow musician Boris Vian, he released an album of his own, which won the prestigious Grand Prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie du Disque fran\u00e7ais in 1958.\nNormally shy, B\u00e9art initially suffered from stage fright and struggled during his concert debut at the Paris Olympia. His biggest hit came when he wrote the soundtrack of the 1958 motion picture, L'Eau vive (Girl and the River in the USA). The title song of the film is considered a classic of what is known as French chanson. Despite his leap to fame, B\u00e9art's singing career was soon swamped by the rising tide of American rock and roll. However, reinventing himself as a host of a television show featuring musical stars from a variety of genres, he remained in the public eye and eventually made a recording comeback.\n\nIn 1963 he and his wife, Genevi\u00e8ve Galea, had a daughter, Emmanuelle, who would grow up to be an actress.\nAfter B\u00e9art's television show ended in 1970, his popularity waned but he continued to record new music that was readily purchased by a loyal following. He was the co-composer of the 1977 Luxembourg entry at the Eurovision Song Contest. By the early 1980s he was almost completely out of the spotlight and, although only in his early fifties, he suffered from a number of serious health problems. In 1987, he published a book about his illness entitled Crazy Hope that, combined with his daughter\u2019s success in the blockbuster film Manon of the Spring, brought a resurgence of popularity. More than 25 years after his first appearance at the Paris Olympia, he returned for a series of highly successful performances.\nIn 1994, B\u00e9art was awarded the Grand Prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in recognition of his achievements over his long career. He continued to perform at a variety of venues around the country and in 1999 did a five-week run at Bobino in Montparnasse that was so popular it allowed for a successful re-release of his double live album recorded at the Olympia.\nIn the 2000s, he only made rare appearances on stage but many of his songs, of which B\u00e9art wrote more than 300 by himself, are still popular with his fans.\nB\u00e9art died of a heart attack at the age of 85 in Garches, on 16 September 2015.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nStudio albums1957: Guy B\u00e9art (or Qu'on est bien)\n1958: Guy B\u00e9art Volume 2 (or L'Eau vive)\n1960: Guy B\u00e9art Volume 3 (or Printemps sans amour)\n1963: Guy B\u00e9art Volume 4 (or Fille d'aujourd'hui)\n1965: Qui suis-je?

          "We had seen photos of the castle reflections in one of the guidebooks but stumbled upon the masterpiece when we were walking around the castle. It is really clever, although I think most people just see it as a water feature to paddle and splash about in. We were here in the",

          "after a visit to the castle we were drawn to the other side where you can see this fascinating fountain. Water spurts out or sprays out intermittently and then goes away, when the water covering the surface is still you can see a perfect reflection of the outline of the castle",

        "wiki": "Nantes (, also US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303t] (listen); Gallo: Naunnt or Nantt [n\u0251\u0303(\u02d0)t]; Breton: Naoned [\u02c8n\u00e3un\u0259t]) is a city in Loire-Atlantique on the Loire, 50 km (31 mi) from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth-largest in France, with a population of  303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants. With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis.\nIt is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.\nNantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\nIn 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nNantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its confluence with the Erdre. The origin of the name \"Namnetes\" is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *nant- (river or stream, from the pre-Celtic root *nanto, valley) or from Amnites, another tribal name possibly meaning \"men of the river\".Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00fainkon) and \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kondio\u00fainkon)\u2014which might be read as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00faikon)\u2014in his treatise, Geography. The name was latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as Condevincum (the most common form), Condevicnum, Condivicnum and Condivincum. Although its origins are unclear, \"Condevincum\" seems to be related to the Gaulish word condate \"confluence\".The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as Portus Namnetum \"port of the Namnetes\" and civitas Namnetum \"city of the Namnetes\". Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one; Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes' name continued to evolve, becoming Naneti\u00e6 and Namnetis during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).\n\n\n=== Modern pronunciation and nicknames ===\nNantes is pronounced [n\u0251\u0303t], and the city's inhabitants are known as Nantais [n\u0251\u0303t\u025b]. In Gallo, the o\u00efl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled Naunnt or Nantt and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long [\u0251\u0303]. In Breton, Nantes is known as Naoned or an Naoned, the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton toponyms than in French ones.Nantes' historical nickname was \"Venice of the West\" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit\u00e9 des Ducs \"the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]\" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region's subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rez\u00e9) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes' inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing 16 hectares (40 acres), was one of the largest in Gaul.Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288\u2013290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nLike much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. After Charlemagne's death in 814,  Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city's main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). The 15th century is considered Nantes' first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. At the end of the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town. However, the edict did not reflect local opinion in the Catholic League stronghold. The local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000, and Nantes was one of the last places to resist the authority of Protestant-raised Henry IV. The edict was signed after the capitulation of the Duke of Merc\u0153ur, governor of Brittany.Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city's largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous h\u00f4tels particuliers.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nThe French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vend\u00e9e attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, Fran\u00e7ois de Charette, was executed in Nantes.After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire \"the national bathtub\".The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon's Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nOutlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from R\u00e9union in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on R\u00e9union sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours\u2013Saint-Nazaire railway.Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be transhipped before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a 15 kilometres (9.3 miles)-long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.\n\n\n=== Land reclamation ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as \"the 50 hostages\" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes' industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as \"Nantes Atlantique\" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.The death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nNantes is in north-western France, near the Atlantic Ocean and 342 kilometres (213 miles) south-west of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is  274 kilometres (170 miles) south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orl\u00e9ans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vend\u00e9e (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around 47\u00b013\u2032N 1\u00b032\u2032W).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe Loire is about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is 60 kilometres (37 miles) in length. The river's bed and banks have  changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about 30 kilometres (19 miles) further east. The tidal range can reach 6 metres (20 feet) in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the S\u00e8vre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nNantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 metres (125 feet) above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching 52 metres (171 feet) in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching 30 metres (98 feet). The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNantes has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. The climatic conditions allow to be typically in this zone with almost no influence of the continent as in Paris, the city has strict variations of temperatures and few freezing days in average annual, in addition to a precipitation higher, but also being able to be described informally as a \"Mediterranean altered\" for 1971-2000 normals. Rainfall and its pattern exemplifies this (winters rainier than other seasons), although it is a relatively high total fall in every month (too high average temperature), but in the future may be closer to a dry summer defined if trends persist. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F); snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). Rain is abundant through the year, with an annual average of 820 millimetres (32 inches). The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n\nNantes' layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes' most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and h\u00f4tels particuliers. The area was extended towards the Parc de Proc\u00e9 during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudi\u00e8re and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.\n\nAfter World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes' growing population. The oldest, Les Dervalli\u00e8res, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rez\u00e9, Vertou and Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and  north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.The 4.6-square-kilometre (1.8 sq mi) Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.\n\n\n=== Parks and environment ===\n\nNantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering 218 hectares (540 acres). The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old Magnolia grandiflora and the national collection of camellia. Other large parks include the Parc de Proc\u00e9, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudini\u00e8re, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional 180 hectares (440 acres), include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes' area.The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nNantes is the pr\u00e9fecture (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion. It is the residence of a r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement prefect, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement councils, two elected political bodies.\nThe city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers' Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes' first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold.Since 1995 Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (quartiers), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each  quartier to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes M\u00e9tropole, it encompasses the city's metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes M\u00e9tropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes M\u00e9tropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020 the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes M\u00e9tropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nLocal authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.Nantes' coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city's coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939\u201345 War Cross were added in 1948.Before the revolution, Nantes' motto was \"Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine\" (\"The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord\", a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto\u2014\"Favet Neptunus eunti\" (\"Neptune favours the traveller\")\u2014in 1816. Nantes' flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.\n\n\n=== Nantes and Brittany ===\n\nNantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five d\u00e9partements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining d\u00e9partements into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement formed a new region with four other d\u00e9partements, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (\"Loire Countries\") although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe P\u00e9tain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.Debate continues about Nantes' place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is  similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.\n\n\n=== Twinning ===\n\nNantes has made nine international sister-city arrangements since 1964. Arrangements have been made with:\nCardiff, Wales (1964)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Germany (1965)\nTbilisi, Georgia (1979)\nSeattle and Jacksonville, Florida (1980-1984)\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (1991)\nNiigata, Niigata, Japan (1999)\nDurban, South Africa (2005)\nQingdao, China (2005)\nSuncheon, Jeonnam, South Korea (2007)The city has made agreements with other cities and regions, including Turin, Liverpool, Hamburg, Asturias and Quebec. Partnership agreements have been signed with cities in developing countries, including Dschang, Cameroon, Grand'Anse, Haiti and Kindia, Guinea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nNantes had 298,029 inhabitants in 2016, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes' population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring communes of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding communes. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity, religions and languages ===\n\nNantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.Nantes is historically a Catholic city, with a cathedral, two minor basilicas, about 40 churches and around 20 chapels. Western France is traditionally religious, and the Catholic influence on Nantes was more persistent than in other large French cities. However, it has waned since the 1970s because of the rise of atheism and secularism. Although Nantes is where Protestantism was permitted in France through its edict, Protestants have always formed a small minority. The main Protestant church belongs to the United Protestant Church of France, but the city also has a number of newer Evangelical and Baptist churches. Nantes had a small Jewish community during the Middle Ages, but Jews were expelled from Brittany in 1240 and Judaism only reappeared after the French Revolution. The city has one synagogue, built in 1852. The city had several hundred Muslim inhabitants during the 1950s, but (as in the rest of France) their number increased in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of large numbers of Africans and Turks. Nantes' first mosque was built in 1976, with three more built in 2010\u20132012.The city is part of the territory of the langues d'o\u00efl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (parler nantais) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFor centuries, Nantes' economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN Biscuit), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with 500,000 square metres (5,400,000 square feet) of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.\n\nThe city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing \u20ac55 billion annually; \u20ac29 billion returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes M\u00e9tropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseilles, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region's largest retail area  with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France's seventh-most-visited city.In 2014, 74.6 percent of the city's businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes\u2013Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nNantes' cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-\u00c9tienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside  the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.\n\nSeveral 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes' medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes' chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860. \n\nAfter the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the pr\u00e9fecture, 1763\u20131783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790\u20131815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the h\u00f4tels particuliers and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called \"Nantais baroque\".\n\nMost of Nantes' churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840\u20131843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lef\u00e8vre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city's largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.The Dobr\u00e9e Museum, closed for repairs as of 2017, houses the d\u00e9partement's archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany's heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a  12-metre-tall (39 ft), walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the Machines were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes' largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nLe Z\u00e9nith Nantes M\u00e9tropole, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France's largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes' largest venue is La Cit\u00e9, Nantes Events Center, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre universitaire and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nThe Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan's Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.Estuaire contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet and Dan Graham.La Folle Journ\u00e9e (The Mad Day, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfi\u00e8re d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univercin\u00e9 (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.\n\n\n=== Slavery Memorial ===\nA path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word \u201cfreedom\u201d written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st.  At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.\n\n\n=== In the arts ===\n\nNantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since Andr\u00e9 Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vach\u00e9 there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), Andr\u00e9 Breton called Nantes \"perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me\". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 M\u00e9moires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Mus\u00e9e noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: Lola (1964) and A Room in Town (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include God's Thunder by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re (1965), The Married Couple of the Year Two by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), Day Off by Pascal Thomas (2001) and Black Venus by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard's Keep Your Right Up was filmed at its airport in 1987.Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007's \"Nantes\" by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include \"Nantes\" by Barbara (1964) and \"Nantes\" by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. \"Dans les prisons de Nantes\" is the most popular, with versions recorded by \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include \"Le pont de Nantes\" (recorded by Guy B\u00e9art in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), \"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Nantes\" (a sea shanty) and the bawdy \"De Nantes \u00e0 Montaigu\".British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the \"special character\" of the local \"plebeian\" cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes' largest and best-known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.Beurre blanc is Nantes' most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), berlingot (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar rigolette sweets with marmalade filling, g\u00e2teau nantais (a rum cake invented in 1820), Cur\u00e9 nantais and M\u00e2checoulais cheeses and fouace, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien R\u00e9gime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013\u20132014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students. The university is part of the EPSCP Bretagne-Loire Universit\u00e9, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region's academic and research potential.In addition to the university, Nantes has a number of colleges and other institutes of higher education. Audencia, a private management school, is ranked as one of the world's best by the Financial Times and The Economist. The city has five engineering schools: Oniris (veterinary medicine and food safety), \u00c9cole centrale de Nantes (mechanical and civil engineering), Polytech Nantes (digital technology and civil engineering), \u00c9cole des mines de Nantes (nuclear technology, safety and energy) and ICAM (research and logistics). Nantes has three other  grandes \u00e9coles: the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure du bois (forestry and wood processing), the School of Design and Exi-Cesi (computing). Other institutes of higher education include a national merchant navy school, a fine-arts school, a national architectural school and Epitech and Supinfo (computing).\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNantes has several large sports facilities. The largest is the Stade de la Beaujoire, built for UEFA Euro 1984. The stadium, which also hosted matches during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, has 37,473 seats. The second-largest venue is the Hall XXL, an exhibition hall on the Stade de la Beaujoire grounds. The 10,700-seat stadium was selected as a venue for the 2017 World Men's Handball Championship. Smaller facilities include the 4,700-seat indoor Palais des Sports, a venue for EuroBasket 1983. The nearby Mangin Beaulieu sports complex has 2,500 seats and Pierre Quinon Stadium, an athletics stadium within the University of Nantes, has 790 seats. La Trocardi\u00e8re, an indoor 4,238-seat stadium, is in Rez\u00e9. The Erdre has a marina and a centre for rowing, sailing and canoeing, and the city has six swimming pools.Six teams in Nantes play at a high national or international level. Best known is FC Nantes, which is a member of Ligue 1 for the 2018\u201319 season. Since its formation in 1943, the club has won eight Championnat titles and three Coupes de France. FC Nantes has several French professional football records, including the most consecutive seasons in the elite division (44), most wins in a season (26), consecutive wins (32) and consecutive home wins (92 games, nearly five years). In handball, volleyball and basketball, Nantes' men's and women's clubs play in the French first division: HBC Nantes and Nantes Loire Atlantique Handball (handball), Nantes Rez\u00e9 M\u00e9tropole Volley and Volley-Ball Nantes (volleyball) and Hermine de Nantes Atlantique and Nantes Rez\u00e9 Basket (basketball). The men's Nantes Erdre Futsal futsal team plays in the Championnat de France de Futsal, and the main athletics team (Nantes M\u00e9tropole Athl\u00e9tisme) includes some of France's best athletes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe city is linked to Paris by the A11 motorway, which passes through Angers, Le Mans and Chartres. Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a 43-kilometre (27 mi) ring road around the city, France's second-longest after the ring in Bordeaux.Nantes' central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercit\u00e9s trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orl\u00e9ans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) south-east of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as \"Tan\". One of the world's first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of 43.5 kilometres (27.0 miles) of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Ch\u00e2teaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.\n\n\n=== Nantes Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Nantes & Saint-Nazaire, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 40 min. 7.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 16.8% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe local press is dominated by the Ouest-France group, which owns the area's two major newspapers: Ouest-France and Presse-Oc\u00e9an. Ouest-France, based in Rennes, covers north-western France and is the country's best-selling newspaper. Presse-Oc\u00e9an, based in Nantes, covers Loire-Atlantique. The Ouest-France group is also a shareholder of the French edition of 20 Minutes, one of two free newspapers distributed in the city. The other free paper is Direct Matin, which has no local edition. The news agency M\u00e9dias C\u00f4te Ouest publishes Wik and Kostar, two free magazines dedicated to local cultural life. Nantes has a satirical weekly newspaper, La Lettre \u00e0 Lulu, and several specialised magazines.

Virgin Radio has a local outlet in nearby Basse-Goulaine, and Ch\u00e9rie FM and NRJ have outlets in Rez\u00e9. Nantes is home to France Bleu Loire-Oc\u00e9an, the local station of the Radio France public network, and several private local stations: Alternantes, dedicated to cultural diversity and tolerance; Euradionantes, a local- and European-news station; Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, a Christian station; Hit West and SUN Radio, two music stations; Prun, dedicated to students, and Radio Atlantis (focused on the local economy).Nantes is the headquarters of France 3 Pays de la Loire, one of 24 local stations of the France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions national public broadcaster. France 3 Pays de la Loire provides local news and programming for the region. The city is also home to T\u00e9l\u00e9nantes, a local, private television channel founded in 2004. Primarily a news channel, it is available in Loire-Atlantique and parts of neighbouring Vend\u00e9e and Maine-et-Loire.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nNantes is the birthplace of Duke of Brittany Arthur I and Duchess Anne of Brittany, who was queen consort twice. Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie, a French royalist military commander was born here. The city is the hometown of naval officer Jacques Cassard, General Pierre Cambronne, science-fiction writer Jules Verne, statesmen Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau and 1926 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate Aristide Briand, automotive pioneer Jules-Albert de Dion, surrealist Claude Cahun, film directors Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re and Jean-Loup Hubert, cartoonist Claire Bret\u00e9cher, yachtsmen \u00c9ric Tabarly and Lo\u00efck Peyron, singers Jeanne Cherhal and Christine and the Queens, author Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau and disc jockeys Madeon and C2C.

        "wiki": "Nantes (, also US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303t] (listen); Gallo: Naunnt or Nantt [n\u0251\u0303(\u02d0)t]; Breton: Naoned [\u02c8n\u00e3un\u0259t]) is a city in Loire-Atlantique on the Loire, 50 km (31 mi) from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth-largest in France, with a population of  303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants. With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis.\nIt is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.\nNantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\nIn 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nNantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its confluence with the Erdre. The origin of the name \"Namnetes\" is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *nant- (river or stream, from the pre-Celtic root *nanto, valley) or from Amnites, another tribal name possibly meaning \"men of the river\".Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00fainkon) and \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kondio\u00fainkon)\u2014which might be read as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00faikon)\u2014in his treatise, Geography. The name was latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as Condevincum (the most common form), Condevicnum, Condivicnum and Condivincum. Although its origins are unclear, \"Condevincum\" seems to be related to the Gaulish word condate \"confluence\".The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as Portus Namnetum \"port of the Namnetes\" and civitas Namnetum \"city of the Namnetes\". Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one; Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes' name continued to evolve, becoming Naneti\u00e6 and Namnetis during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).\n\n\n=== Modern pronunciation and nicknames ===\nNantes is pronounced [n\u0251\u0303t], and the city's inhabitants are known as Nantais [n\u0251\u0303t\u025b]. In Gallo, the o\u00efl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled Naunnt or Nantt and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long [\u0251\u0303]. In Breton, Nantes is known as Naoned or an Naoned, the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton toponyms than in French ones.Nantes' historical nickname was \"Venice of the West\" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit\u00e9 des Ducs \"the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]\" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region's subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rez\u00e9) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes' inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing 16 hectares (40 acres), was one of the largest in Gaul.Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288\u2013290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nLike much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. After Charlemagne's death in 814,  Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city's main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). The 15th century is considered Nantes' first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. At the end of the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town. However, the edict did not reflect local opinion in the Catholic League stronghold. The local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000, and Nantes was one of the last places to resist the authority of Protestant-raised Henry IV. The edict was signed after the capitulation of the Duke of Merc\u0153ur, governor of Brittany.Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city's largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous h\u00f4tels particuliers.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nThe French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vend\u00e9e attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, Fran\u00e7ois de Charette, was executed in Nantes.After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire \"the national bathtub\".The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon's Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nOutlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from R\u00e9union in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on R\u00e9union sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours\u2013Saint-Nazaire railway.Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be transhipped before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a 15 kilometres (9.3 miles)-long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.\n\n\n=== Land reclamation ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as \"the 50 hostages\" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes' industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as \"Nantes Atlantique\" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.The death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nNantes is in north-western France, near the Atlantic Ocean and 342 kilometres (213 miles) south-west of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is  274 kilometres (170 miles) south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orl\u00e9ans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vend\u00e9e (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around 47\u00b013\u2032N 1\u00b032\u2032W).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe Loire is about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is 60 kilometres (37 miles) in length. The river's bed and banks have  changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about 30 kilometres (19 miles) further east. The tidal range can reach 6 metres (20 feet) in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the S\u00e8vre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nNantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 metres (125 feet) above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching 52 metres (171 feet) in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching 30 metres (98 feet). The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNantes has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. The climatic conditions allow to be typically in this zone with almost no influence of the continent as in Paris, the city has strict variations of temperatures and few freezing days in average annual, in addition to a precipitation higher, but also being able to be described informally as a \"Mediterranean altered\" for 1971-2000 normals. Rainfall and its pattern exemplifies this (winters rainier than other seasons), although it is a relatively high total fall in every month (too high average temperature), but in the future may be closer to a dry summer defined if trends persist. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F); snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). Rain is abundant through the year, with an annual average of 820 millimetres (32 inches). The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n\nNantes' layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes' most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and h\u00f4tels particuliers. The area was extended towards the Parc de Proc\u00e9 during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudi\u00e8re and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.\n\nAfter World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes' growing population. The oldest, Les Dervalli\u00e8res, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rez\u00e9, Vertou and Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and  north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.The 4.6-square-kilometre (1.8 sq mi) Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.\n\n\n=== Parks and environment ===\n\nNantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering 218 hectares (540 acres). The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old Magnolia grandiflora and the national collection of camellia. Other large parks include the Parc de Proc\u00e9, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudini\u00e8re, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional 180 hectares (440 acres), include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes' area.The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nNantes is the pr\u00e9fecture (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion. It is the residence of a r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement prefect, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement councils, two elected political bodies.\nThe city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers' Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes' first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold.Since 1995 Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (quartiers), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each  quartier to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes M\u00e9tropole, it encompasses the city's metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes M\u00e9tropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes M\u00e9tropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020 the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes M\u00e9tropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nLocal authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.Nantes' coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city's coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939\u201345 War Cross were added in 1948.Before the revolution, Nantes' motto was \"Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine\" (\"The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord\", a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto\u2014\"Favet Neptunus eunti\" (\"Neptune favours the traveller\")\u2014in 1816. Nantes' flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.\n\n\n=== Nantes and Brittany ===\n\nNantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five d\u00e9partements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining d\u00e9partements into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement formed a new region with four other d\u00e9partements, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (\"Loire Countries\") although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe P\u00e9tain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.Debate continues about Nantes' place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is  similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.\n\n\n=== Twinning ===\n\nNantes has made nine international sister-city arrangements since 1964. Arrangements have been made with:\nCardiff, Wales (1964)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Germany (1965)\nTbilisi, Georgia (1979)\nSeattle and Jacksonville, Florida (1980-1984)\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (1991)\nNiigata, Niigata, Japan (1999)\nDurban, South Africa (2005)\nQingdao, China (2005)\nSuncheon, Jeonnam, South Korea (2007)The city has made agreements with other cities and regions, including Turin, Liverpool, Hamburg, Asturias and Quebec. Partnership agreements have been signed with cities in developing countries, including Dschang, Cameroon, Grand'Anse, Haiti and Kindia, Guinea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nNantes had 298,029 inhabitants in 2016, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes' population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring communes of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding communes. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity, religions and languages ===\n\nNantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.Nantes is historically a Catholic city, with a cathedral, two minor basilicas, about 40 churches and around 20 chapels. Western France is traditionally religious, and the Catholic influence on Nantes was more persistent than in other large French cities. However, it has waned since the 1970s because of the rise of atheism and secularism. Although Nantes is where Protestantism was permitted in France through its edict, Protestants have always formed a small minority. The main Protestant church belongs to the United Protestant Church of France, but the city also has a number of newer Evangelical and Baptist churches. Nantes had a small Jewish community during the Middle Ages, but Jews were expelled from Brittany in 1240 and Judaism only reappeared after the French Revolution. The city has one synagogue, built in 1852. The city had several hundred Muslim inhabitants during the 1950s, but (as in the rest of France) their number increased in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of large numbers of Africans and Turks. Nantes' first mosque was built in 1976, with three more built in 2010\u20132012.The city is part of the territory of the langues d'o\u00efl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (parler nantais) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFor centuries, Nantes' economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN Biscuit), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with 500,000 square metres (5,400,000 square feet) of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.\n\nThe city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing \u20ac55 billion annually; \u20ac29 billion returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes M\u00e9tropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseilles, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region's largest retail area  with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France's seventh-most-visited city.In 2014, 74.6 percent of the city's businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes\u2013Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nNantes' cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-\u00c9tienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside  the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.\n\nSeveral 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes' medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes' chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860. \n\nAfter the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the pr\u00e9fecture, 1763\u20131783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790\u20131815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the h\u00f4tels particuliers and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called \"Nantais baroque\".\n\nMost of Nantes' churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840\u20131843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lef\u00e8vre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city's largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.The Dobr\u00e9e Museum, closed for repairs as of 2017, houses the d\u00e9partement's archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany's heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a  12-metre-tall (39 ft), walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the Machines were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes' largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nLe Z\u00e9nith Nantes M\u00e9tropole, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France's largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes' largest venue is La Cit\u00e9, Nantes Events Center, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre universitaire and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nThe Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan's Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.Estuaire contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet and Dan Graham.La Folle Journ\u00e9e (The Mad Day, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfi\u00e8re d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univercin\u00e9 (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.\n\n\n=== Slavery Memorial ===\nA path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word \u201cfreedom\u201d written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st.  At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.\n\n\n=== In the arts ===\n\nNantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since Andr\u00e9 Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vach\u00e9 there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), Andr\u00e9 Breton called Nantes \"perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me\". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 M\u00e9moires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Mus\u00e9e noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: Lola (1964) and A Room in Town (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include God's Thunder by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re (1965), The Married Couple of the Year Two by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), Day Off by Pascal Thomas (2001) and Black Venus by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard's Keep Your Right Up was filmed at its airport in 1987.Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007's \"Nantes\" by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include \"Nantes\" by Barbara (1964) and \"Nantes\" by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. \"Dans les prisons de Nantes\" is the most popular, with versions recorded by \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include \"Le pont de Nantes\" (recorded by Guy B\u00e9art in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), \"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Nantes\" (a sea shanty) and the bawdy \"De Nantes \u00e0 Montaigu\".British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the \"special character\" of the local \"plebeian\" cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes' largest and best-known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.Beurre blanc is Nantes' most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), berlingot (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar rigolette sweets with marmalade filling, g\u00e2teau nantais (a rum cake invented in 1820), Cur\u00e9 nantais and M\u00e2checoulais cheeses and fouace, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien R\u00e9gime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013\u20132014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000. This was lower than in nearby Rennes (64,000), and Nantes is the ninth-largest commune in France in its percentage of students. The university is part of the EPSCP Bretagne-Loire Universit\u00e9, which joins seven universities in western France to improve the region's academic and research potential.In addition to the university, Nantes has a number of colleges and other institutes of higher education. Audencia, a private management school, is ranked as one of the world's best by the Financial Times and The Economist. The city has five engineering schools: Oniris (veterinary medicine and food safety), \u00c9cole centrale de Nantes (mechanical and civil engineering), Polytech Nantes (digital technology and civil engineering), \u00c9cole des mines de Nantes (nuclear technology, safety and energy) and ICAM (research and logistics). Nantes has three other  grandes \u00e9coles: the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure du bois (forestry and wood processing), the School of Design and Exi-Cesi (computing). Other institutes of higher education include a national merchant navy school, a fine-arts school, a national architectural school and Epitech and Supinfo (computing).\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nNantes has several large sports facilities. The largest is the Stade de la Beaujoire, built for UEFA Euro 1984. The stadium, which also hosted matches during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup, has 37,473 seats. The second-largest venue is the Hall XXL, an exhibition hall on the Stade de la Beaujoire grounds. The 10,700-seat stadium was selected as a venue for the 2017 World Men's Handball Championship. Smaller facilities include the 4,700-seat indoor Palais des Sports, a venue for EuroBasket 1983. The nearby Mangin Beaulieu sports complex has 2,500 seats and Pierre Quinon Stadium, an athletics stadium within the University of Nantes, has 790 seats. La Trocardi\u00e8re, an indoor 4,238-seat stadium, is in Rez\u00e9. The Erdre has a marina and a centre for rowing, sailing and canoeing, and the city has six swimming pools.Six teams in Nantes play at a high national or international level. Best known is FC Nantes, which is a member of Ligue 1 for the 2018\u201319 season. Since its formation in 1943, the club has won eight Championnat titles and three Coupes de France. FC Nantes has several French professional football records, including the most consecutive seasons in the elite division (44), most wins in a season (26), consecutive wins (32) and consecutive home wins (92 games, nearly five years). In handball, volleyball and basketball, Nantes' men's and women's clubs play in the French first division: HBC Nantes and Nantes Loire Atlantique Handball (handball), Nantes Rez\u00e9 M\u00e9tropole Volley and Volley-Ball Nantes (volleyball) and Hermine de Nantes Atlantique and Nantes Rez\u00e9 Basket (basketball). The men's Nantes Erdre Futsal futsal team plays in the Championnat de France de Futsal, and the main athletics team (Nantes M\u00e9tropole Athl\u00e9tisme) includes some of France's best athletes.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe city is linked to Paris by the A11 motorway, which passes through Angers, Le Mans and Chartres. Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a 43-kilometre (27 mi) ring road around the city, France's second-longest after the ring in Bordeaux.Nantes' central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercit\u00e9s trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orl\u00e9ans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) south-east of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as \"Tan\". One of the world's first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of 43.5 kilometres (27.0 miles) of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Ch\u00e2teaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.\n\n\n=== Nantes Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Nantes & Saint-Nazaire, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 40 min. 7.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 16.8% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5 km, while 2% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nThe local press is dominated by the Ouest-France group, which owns the area's two major newspapers: Ouest-France and Presse-Oc\u00e9an. Ouest-France, based in Rennes, covers north-western France and is the country's best-selling newspaper. Presse-Oc\u00e9an, based in Nantes, covers Loire-Atlantique. The Ouest-France group is also a shareholder of the French edition of 20 Minutes, one of two free newspapers distributed in the city. The other free paper is Direct Matin, which has no local edition. The news agency M\u00e9dias C\u00f4te Ouest publishes Wik and Kostar, two free magazines dedicated to local cultural life. Nantes has a satirical weekly newspaper, La Lettre \u00e0 Lulu, and several specialised magazines. Places publiques is dedicated to urbanism in Nantes and Saint-Nazaire; Brief focuses on public communication; Le Journal des Entreprises targets managers; Nouvel Ouest is for decision-makers in western France, and Id\u00eele provides information on the local creative industry. Nantes is home to Mill\u00e9naire Presse\u2014the largest French publishing house dedicated to professional entertainers\u2014which publishes several magazines, including La Sc\u00e8ne. The city publishes a free monthly magazine, Nantes Passion, and five other free magazines for specific areas: Couleur locale (Les Dervalli\u00e8res), Ecrit de Bellevue, Malakocktail (Malakoff) Mosa\u00efques (Nantes-Nord) and Zest for the eastern neighbourhoods.National radio stations FIP and Fun Radio have outlets in Nantes. Virgin Radio has a local outlet in nearby Basse-Goulaine, and Ch\u00e9rie FM and NRJ have outlets in Rez\u00e9. Nantes is home to France Bleu Loire-Oc\u00e9an, the local station of the Radio France public network, and several private local stations: Alternantes, dedicated to cultural diversity and tolerance; Euradionantes, a local- and European-news station; Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, a Christian station; Hit West and SUN Radio, two music stations; Prun, dedicated to students, and Radio Atlantis (focused on the local economy).Nantes is the headquarters of France 3 Pays de la Loire, one of 24 local stations of the France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions national public broadcaster. France 3 Pays de la Loire provides local news and programming for the region. The city is also home to T\u00e9l\u00e9nantes, a local, private television channel founded in 2004. Primarily a news channel, it is available in Loire-Atlantique and parts of neighbouring Vend\u00e9e and Maine-et-Loire.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\nNantes is the birthplace of Duke of Brittany Arthur I and Duchess Anne of Brittany, who was queen consort twice. Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie, a French royalist military commander was born here. The city is the hometown of naval officer Jacques Cassard, General Pierre Cambronne, science-fiction writer Jules Verne, statesmen Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau and 1926 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate Aristide Briand, automotive pioneer Jules-Albert de Dion, surrealist Claude Cahun, film directors Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re and Jean-Loup Hubert, cartoonist Claire Bret\u00e9cher, yachtsmen \u00c9ric Tabarly and Lo\u00efck Peyron, singers Jeanne Cherhal and Christine and the Queens, author Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau and disc jockeys Madeon and C2C.

        "wiki": "This article includes information translated from the Wikipedia article Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de BretagneThe Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne (English: Castle of the Dukes of Brittany) is a large castle located in the city of Nantes in the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement of France; it served as the centre of the historical province of Brittany until its separation in 1956. It is located on the right bank of the Loire, which formerly fed its ditches. It was the residence of the Dukes of Brittany between the 13th and 16th centuries, subsequently becoming the Breton residence of the French Monarchy.\nThe castle has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1862. Today the castle houses the Nantes History Museum.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the town of Nantes undertook a massive programme of restoration and repairs to return the site to its former glory as an emblem of the history of Nantes and Brittany. Following 15 years of works and three years of closure to the public, it was reopened on 9 February 2007 and is now a popular tourist attraction.\nThe restored edifice now includes the new Nantes History Museum, installed in 32 of the castle rooms. The museum presents more than 850 objects of collection with the aid of multimedia devices. The castle and the museum try to offer a modern vision of the heritage by presenting the past, the present and the future of the city. Night-time illuminations at the castle further reinforce the revival of the site.\nThe 500-metre round walk on the fortified ramparts provides views not just of the castle buildings and courtyards but also of the town.\n\n\n=== Seven sequences of the museum ===\nThe Castle, Nantes and Brittany back to the 17th century\nNantes, daughter of the river and the ocean\nCommerce and the black gold in the 18th century\nNantes in Revolution\nA colonial and industrial port (1815\u20131940)\nA new city takes shape (1940\u20131990)\nA great Atlantic city, today and tomorrowThe exhibition ends with a vision of the city, a multimedia creation by a contemporary artist, occupying the entire area of the 32nd room.\nPierrick Sorin is the first guest artist.\n\n\n=== The illuminated castle ===\nThe night-lighting brings out the architectural complexity of the site within an urban context. The illumination was designed by Sylvie Sieg and Pierre N\u00e8gre of the Atelier Lumi\u00e8re and won the Light Originator Price of the Lumiville Trophy 2007.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in France\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)\nNantes Metropole Tourism Office (in English)\nMinistry of Culture database entry for Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne (in French)\nMinistry of Culture photos\nvisite virtuelle 360 photo panoramique \ncastle pictures gallery\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLe ch\u00e2teau des ducs, Nantes et la Bretagne,  Guy SAUPIN, 2010.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMinistry of Culture database, accessed 28 July 2007 (in French)\n\n\n== Gallery ==",

          "This is well worth a visit if in Nantes. There is a charge to go into the museum but to walk around the grounds is free (and there are signs up in a French and English explaining this). The views are very nice and there is also a cafe in the grounds. When I visited there is a",
          "Popped here on route to the gardens, glad we did. Came accros the slide. Was pleasantly surprised that it was free. A nice place to visit.",
          "Stopped by here while the big slide was still in operation. Didn't quite manage to go on it because it gets closed down when the sun comes out (something about burning customers backsides...a definite no-no for return custom! :). Really well maintained site and quite worth the",
          "The castle is nice a mix of medieval & renaissance architectures (the castle started as a stronghold but building was paused and finished as the renaissance had kicked in). Nice temporary exhibits at the musuem. Just don\"t bother about visiting the main useum itself, there is",
          "It was worth stopping by during our visit to Nantes, but admittedly, there are many nicer chateaux in the Loire than this one. The slide around the castle wall looked interesting and was free for adults and children taller than 130 cm, be sure to wear closed shoes because they",
          "Very imposing on the outside, dazzlingly pretty on the inside, must be the first place to visit in Nantes. Fun exhibits, excellent staff and ideal little cafe.",
          "It is free to enter the grounds but there are charges to enter both the chateau and the exhibition area. The ch\u00e2teau itself is set out in a series of 32 rooms which take the visitor through the history of Nantes. The exhibits are well presented, however there were a few places",
          "The exterior of the castle deserves some time. We found the interior not so interesting, but maybe after one week to the other Castles of the Loire our interest diminished a bit...",
          "This castle, in the middle of town, is definitely worth the visit. You can walk on the ramparts for no cost. There are restaurants and a cafe in the courtyard as well as picnic tables",
          "We were impressed with this place - its scale, state of preservation, and the free access allowed. It isa very solid edifice, the surrounding moat now mostly grassed, but with turtles (terrapins?) and fish in the flooded part. We spent an engaging couple of hours here. The",
          "Not only is the castle beautiful and striking from the outside - complete with a moat - but the inside has a museum! It doesn't only give information about the chateau itself, but about Nantes and Brittany and their historical roles as well. One of my favorite things in Nantes,",
          "Free entry an able to walk all around the ramparts. We didn\u2019t bother with the museum, as we thought it would be lost on our 4 year old. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "I very much enjoyed the visit. I was a bit rushed and skipped visiting the museum, which is a shame but never the less very much enjoyed walking around the castle.",

          "We read the reviews & decided the interior sounded too large for our 10 year old, so we enjoyed the other areas. We walked the grounds along the moat & then the ramparts. We rode the super fast slide down the side of the castle to exit the ramparts (brillant idea). All free",
          "Amazing Chateau complete with moat and draw bridge. It is now a very good modernish museum inside but l wish they had kept it more like the outside and grounds. A bit too whitewashed inside.",

          "The Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne was an informative and interesting glimpse into the history of Nantes from its early beginning to the Twentieth Century. Although the more detailed information was in French, English subtitles make it possible to understand the driving forces",

          "Nice variety of museum exhibits from slavery to the revolution and of course the wars. Only thing missing was an interior of the castle when used by royalty which personally we would have liked. Beautiful surroundings, the outside road us being renovated hopefully this will",
          "The building like many in France is stunning but once you've paid 20 euro to go inside it is very disappointing. As with nearly all of the places we have visited in France it is for the French which is surprising given the number of English speaking tourists that visit France.",
          "I have been to many castles and here you have a castle unspoiled, little modern restoration, easy to follow guide, plenty to explore inside and out and stunning views from the battlements",
          "The musem has little to do with the castle: most rooms (over 30, good luck finding your way in such warm and humid place) contain historical elements (mosts are COPIES, not even original!!) of the city and the Loire valley. There are even a couple of rooms about the 2nd world",
          "We visited during a brief break in Nantes. Entry into the castle was free allowing us to walk along the ramparts and gardens. Good views of Nantes and pleasant enough with plenty of people relaxing on the lawns in the most area. The museum was OK, a bit hit and miss with some",

          "This is a wonderful place to visit and nice of all the grounds, courtyard and ramparts are free to experience. Full of history, excellent explanatory signage in French but with English too. Gift shop and cafe available too. We did not visit the exposition which does have an",

          "This is a very interesting \"castle\", although it is more of a fortified palace, with the usual chequered history. Good views from the battlements and the buildings around the courtyard are beautiful. The museum is quite interesting also.",
          "Built right in the centre of Nantes this castle served as a military base for many years. It's free to wander around the old walls and around the moat which still has water in it. There is a museum covering the slave trade any early Nantes history but not much in English.",

          "There is a museum, gift shop, cafe, tours, but even if you don't have much time, at least walk around the grounds and go into the courtyard to appreciate the way the dukes and duchesses would have lived. The castle is well maintained and looks a little different from every",
          "Walked round the grounds which gave some interesting information. Have seen in plenty of castles and chateau in my time so never ventured inside.",
          "With this Chateau, the access to the grounds is free, and we didn't pay to visit the exhibitions. You can walk right around the ramparts and also the gardens below, there are some lovely views of the city and several information boards to point out landmarks etc. Only downside",

          "You can go into the courtyard and walk along the outer walls without paying. But then you would miss the excellent museum. The audio guide for the museum was excellent, and the exhibits were well presented. Definitely worth the entry fee.",
          "Wonderful castle to visit. You can walk all the way round the walls for free which is great, but easily missed.",
          "Worth the visit and to wander around the outside. Floodlit at night and in front the dancing fountains with many colours displayed in the water.",
          "This is one of the most gorgeous castles. The white stone and the beautiful details uplift me every time. I enjoy the museum, too.",

          "Everytime I visit my sister who lives in Nantes, I go to the chateau.. because I love it. Not only it is beautiful, but there is always something going on. Last time I went there was live music , and a master graffiti competition on makeshift walls. How cool is that! And the",
          "We visited on the 1st Sunday of the month, which allows free entry. Even if we\u2019d paid the full amount it would have been worth it; the Chateau houses an excellent museum dealing with the history of Nantes across the Centuries. Excellent exhibits, including an animation sequence",
          "Went there in the month of July and loved it. I did the tour by myself. I was just disappointed I could not use the slide going down the side of the castle, (they were doing some maintenance), but it looked very cool. The castle stands just in the middle of the old Nantes",
          "nothing special, but nice. old, nearby center, i dont know what said more... maybe - in the night without lights-why?",

          "Beautiful old castle. Nice gardens around. It is the nantes history museum. The museum is very nice, it was things about the castle construction and also recent history",
          "So cool to have a medieval castle in the middle of town. It's really well maintained and a beautiful structure. It's free to walk around and inside but there is a charge for the museum which we didn't do. It's a must when in Nantes!",
          "Magnificent 15th century Chateau - from the ramparts, good views over Nantes \u2026 find out about the redoubtable Anne of Brittany from 5 centuries ago - pleasant cafe in the grounds.",
          "Very impozant building. Heart od old town. Special architecture and expositions. Around Chateau is nice park. I recommend.",
          "It was okay - Audio tour guide is a must and there is a lot to see - cafe/coffee seems to only work on hot sunny dry days - we visit on a dull drizzly day . Probably one of those places you see as a must visit but afterwards come away saying that was just okay . . . . .",
          "As my command of French is weak, I did not expect to learn and enjoy the museum as much as I did. We even went back a second day to see the rest of the exhibits. Buy the 20 euro pass that admits you to multiple museums in Nantes over a period of a year Quite a bargain.",
          "Stunning castle, interesting museum finished to a very high quality. Audio guides available in several languages. FYI - lots of stairs.",
          "This place is stunning! It cost \u20ac8 each and it was well worth it with 32 rooms to look in. Information in each room is in French, English and Spanish which was fantastic for us. The outside is absolutely beautiful and the tour continues there. It is wheelchair friendly and",

          "Lovely place to take a stroll. We didn't go inside but enjoyed a free walk around the ramparts. Very informative stops at viewing points around the walk. The main toilets were closed but the little cafe was happy for us to use their faculties.",
          "We spent hours on a visit to the museum and exhibition which was all fascinating. Plenty here to see and excellent portrayal of Nantes history. Staff were very helpful and the English translation guide was very good.",
          "Hubby had wanted to see this chateau while we were in Nantes. After white knuckling the drive in, we were able to park in the parking lot across a grassy knoll from the chateau. It was lovely! There are books throughout the many rooms to tour in the castle, with an English",
          "If you are in Nantes, this is an attraction not to be missed, take your time walk in and around which you can do for free.",
          "The castle is at walking distance from downtown Nantes. It is interesting for its history, tightly connected to French Kingdom one, for the Anne de Bretagne (who married two French Kings at the Renaissance) remembering, for the furniture and the objects presented in the museum,",
          "There is no charge to walk around the moat and the ramparts. There was also an interesting temporary exhibition of photographs. It seems to be a very well preserved and presented historical building.",
          "In all fairness we were short on time and never went into the chateau itself. It is free to enter the courtyard and to walk the walls. We did do that and got a spectacular view of Nantes and a good feel for the magnificence of the chateau. Worth seeing.",
          "We stopped by here, just to take some photos and have a general look around. You can pay and go inside the museum/exhibits, but we just wanted a wander around the grounds and ramparts, which is free. It's well kept and has been sympathetically restored. It has a moat going",
          "This is a beautifully restored castle, and absolutely enormous. There are 32 rooms to explore, and a lot of stairs, although they have thoughtfully put lifts in all over the place. They have certainly gone to great trouble to make this a very good experience and if you go into",
          "Great place. Been to a number of castles throughout Europe this is right up there, and the displays, signage and technology to assist your visit, as good as I have seen You could walk the Castle including walls at no charge, inside a reasonable fee to inspect and extremely well",
          "I was amazed how good the castle has been maintained through out. I would recommend getting the Nante city day pass so that you can pick up the audio guide for free. There are 32 rooms and you can spend as much time as you can. I learned a lot about Nante history and its",
          "Unfortunately the museum was closed when we went, However, there is a well signposted tour all around the ramparts and across the courtyard. Absolutely stunning views of the (partly rebuilt) architecture, the walls and Nantes around it. 2 hours just flew by",
          "Chateau grounds and ramparts free to use - did not pay to look around the chateau. Slide from ramparts to ground not open on day we visited - this looks good fun",
          "The battlements are free and offer interesting views. The castle is also a museum and the audio guide started and ended well, though was a bit repetitious towards the beginning. There was a lot about slavery that was new to us and very interesting. Well worth a visit",
          "When it comes to France it is hard choosing a place to stay in general due to the country being rich in History and culture and when it comes to Nantes the city is so rich in history just walking through the streets you see the modern industrial out skirts and as you go into the",
          "A very well preserved castle which has a free section to walk around as well as a paid area. It has a restaurant inside too. Worth a visit if visiting the area.",
          "it's well preserved ground castles with almost all the walls and building in well preserved conditions like it's been still populated by it's peoples! english meaning of the name is \" Castle of the Dukes of Brittany\" and has rich history associated with it. the fortification",
          "My two princesses (three and six) loved visiting this castle. It is free to walk around the outside. You can slide down from the top to the bottom but you must be adequately clothed to avoid any friction burns so shorts won't do. Really nice to walk around in the sunshine.",
          "Use a guided tour as a first attempt to the visit and then do the museum again. A very well managed museum which allows people to fully undestand the history of Nantes.",
          "Wandered around here in the early evening (it closes at 8.00pm) - was amazed at how much of the castle was open to the public free of charge - the walk around the ramparts was much fun!",
          "Really interesting visit. The only thing-all videos are in French. May be they can think about English subtitles for the future?",
          "Very beautiful city to visit soon going to live there. I love the city and have too much to visit the castle is incredible reminds me Portugal the castle and old this to visit very similar. Coming back soon!",
          "My wife and I went expecting to see a chateau with hanging tapestries, furniture, etc, the sort of thing we've seen many times before but in essence the chateau is simply a museum with a history of Nantes mainly in pictures and text. It does what it does quite well but it isn't",
          "Don\u2019t leave Nantes without seeing this magnificent castle. Built from 13th to 16th century, this former home of Francis II and Duchess Anne has a massive story to tell. They also showcase other notable historic figures of Nantes such as the Lef\u00e8vre-Utile or better known",
          "Stunning moated castle, spent a lovely afternoon exploring all around. Very well preserved and free to walk around",
          "Walk the walls for free and get some interesting sights of Nantes. The walls are relatively high but nice to walk around to get a different aspect of Nantes. Good views and not difficult. Descent can be via a slide off the walls to the ground!! well good.",
          "That's a castle which really deserves a bit of your time during the visit in Nantes. Try to take half a day to have a walk around and a visit inside. I have been told that concerts and other events are taking place here from time to time, but I haven't got the chance to join any",
          "Great chateau with great history. Walk the ramparts for a visual guide as to how Nantes has transformed itself with diverting and redirecting the river - pity since Nantes was probably nicer with more water and less road",
          "The castle itself is very picturesque and pretty. It has additions from different eras featuring different styles of architecture. The ramparts and exterior are free to enter. If it's a nice day and this is the part you're most interested in its a great free activity. Was busy",
          "Spent a brilliant afternoon at the Chateau with my 11 yo daughter in which we were given a guided tour and a workshop where she made a pop-up card of the chateau. Highly recommend this attraction.",
          "This chateau is an imposing presence in the downtown area. We paid 8E for entry and another 2E for the audioguide. Interesting content especially France's part in the slave trade for about 350 years. I think we spent 4 hours in the museum but at the end got lost from the stream",
          "The castle is free to enter and handily has it's own tram stop. When you enter then you can walk around the courtyard and go along the ramparts. For those wanting a bit more history then there is a museum in one of the buildings covering the history of the castle and Nantes.",
          "We subscribed the kids to an activity, which they really like. Please note we booked more than a month in advance - looks like it is quite popular. During that time (as parents were not allowed), we walked in the remparts and down to the cathedral near by. We have not been",
          "This picture perfect castle and the walk around the courtyard and battlements is not to be missed and makes for a most fascinating visit.. If you have time please discover the gardens and moat which surround the castle and watch both the fish and the turtles swimming there. The",
          "We spent the good part of the afternoon here, looking through all the different rooms off the museum, which cover the entire history of Nantes. The city put a lot of effort into the museum and it is well worth the money.",
          "We had a tremendous visit to this terrific with lots to do - the museum inside is full of some very interesting rooms though you should plan to allow for at least a couple of hours to take it all in. A definite must if staying in or near Nantes.",
          "The castle itself is impressive, that goes without saying. But we also enjoyed visiting the museum which not just illustrated the history of the castle but also about the city of Nantes. Particulary interesting was the section on the slave trade and the involvement of the",
          "Visited the Chateau, with my teenage son and parents. Fantastic day out. Largely free of charge, this castle boasts plenty to see and do in the heart of Nantes",
          "Beautiful chateau with a great view over Nantes. You can spend a lot of time here in the museum and walking around the place.",
          "Worth visiting when in Nantes. There are always extra exhibitions that change during the year. Good information available and friendly staff assisting. Highly recommended",
          "If you want to feel that you are in an old time season, visit this castle. It's not faraway from the city center. Beside it there are a large square and a park where you can have a relax if the weather is good",
          "This is an excellent chateau & museum. There are exhibits on the history of the city, from its founding through to today. It was recently reconstructed, finished in the early 2000's. Its been exquisitely redone.",
          "The castle itself is relatively small and you are restricted to mainly the outside areas. The moat is nice and there are plenty of benches for picnics. The museum tour (not free) is amazing, includes 34 rooms of items chronologically through the time when Nantes was the main",
          "There are many other chateaus in France that are more beautiful, but if you're in Nantes, then this is a must see. It gave us a much better idea of the history of the city and region. Good for 1.5 - 2 hours.",
          "Very average as castles go, but worth a visit to the photos and walk along the ramparts. You are probably better off to stick with the outside area and not bother with the interior.",
          "It was build by a Bretagne Duc and his daughter Annearoumd 16 century...strong walls...strong contruction surrended by a canal and fortifications...it is situated jn the center of the city...near is the fabric of the famous Petit Beurre biscuits.",
          "If you do not know anything about the history of Bretagne and its aristocratic lineage, this is a good place to start. The castle is nestled in the heart of historical Nantes, a stone throw away from the cathedral. Its remparts and imposing towers are well preserved and, as",
          "Definitely worth a visit to stroll into the courtyard and into the gardens and along the ramparts. All of this is free Inside didn't offer anything very much. It's marginal whether it's worth the price and certainly not a priority to visit in the city.",
          "The chateau with it's precinct and fortifications is an interesting building to visit and the external parts are free to wander around. The inside of the main chateau has been converted into a very good museum about the history of Nantes and Brittany but there was no remnant of",
          "This castle is really something special. The museum inside was very interesting and I learned a lot about Nantes. It's on a good location and the views are amazing.",
          "The whole ambience of this Chateau is quite different to others I have seen. Great drawbridge entrance. The long stone stairs leading up from the courtyard to the battlements which gave an interesting view of a water park - go down there for an hours enjoyment playing with mist",
          "This great chateau belong to dukes of Brittany. It was rebuild a few times. Many parts of this chateau features are of great interest.",
          "Very interesting . The things are assembled in a very smart way . It is even interactive in some spots . You can easily spend 1:30 h there without even noticing . Awesome",
          "Beautiful setting and beautiful architecture - a very special place to see. The square inside is well worth a look as is the view from the ramparts. But it's a great photo from outside !",
          "This is a beautiful chateau, castle, with historic significance in the center of Nantes, France. The edict of Nantes may have been signed here, which legalized Protestantism in France or until Louie xIV revoked it causing more than 200,00 hugonauts to flee France.",
          "Get 2h before closing (18:30) or you won't be able to visit the inside of the castle, The outside it's open until 19:30",
          "Visited free as part of the Nantes Pass, and used the self-guided English audio tour. Absolutely brilliant and enjoyed the experience so much that the security had to come and find us to close! The audio guides are available in several languages but there were a couple of films",
          "passed by Nantes after few years without visiting it and I finally could visit the castle which was closed for years. The Chateau offers a nice promenade and also a date with history as it has signs with different tips of history. It is definitely a must see in Nantes, I loved",
          "well worth a visit. DIsplays are very good, Staff are so helpful. So much to do and see took a few hours to walk completely round",
          "We walked the ramparts & listened to the audio about the castle learning about life in Nantes in the 15th C. then we went into the museum. It was absolutely outstanding sharing history through artifacts, paintings, sculptures, much of which had English translations - finally!",
          "We were staying overnight in Nantes on our way to Cherbourg so decided to visit the Chateau after breakfast in town - lovely castle with many interesting features including the walk around the battlements. Nice views and great central location in the old part of the city.",
          "This was more than just another chateau- it was a well laid out history of Nante and indirectly a history of France as well. We could have spent far more time here - many many interesting displays and exhibits- We did the self directed tour but in retrospect I think a guided",
          "Well worth the visit - inside and out including below the Ramparts. Free on the first Sunday of the month. The main museum tour is well worth doing however the last sections - 23 to 26 were by far the most interesting to me featuring the Lu factory and WWI and WWII exhibitions.",
          "Excellent restoration. Easy, free access. You can walk around the walls, fairly steep steps to the top and get good views over Nantes. In summer various attractions on site. Restaurant on site but plenty of choice just outside the chateau.Well worth a visit.",
          "It is a really interesting museum about the history of Nantes! It is a must-see attraction for sure! Besides its historical content, it\u00b4s also a beautiful castle!",

          "Fantastic chateau/fort/castle: the grounds are always open for wandering or picnicking on the grass, feeding fish and ducks in the moat or just reading on a bench. My son and I bought tickets (50% discount for him as under 25 and for me as a teacher!) and spent a few hours",
          "We visited it because we had purchased a Nantes pass. It was a brilliant experience and would recommend with the audio guide.",

          "It is a very interesting museum. I found it very clean and well organised. It has small videos about the history and well adapted for kids. I recommend it.",
          "This is truly a most interesting castle - worth visiting; not to be missed when in Nantes. It has a large, comprehensive history museum. Its most interesting part seemed to be the one related to the history of Bretagne - as linked to Duchess Eleonore - but it's not the only one.",
          "Free visits every first Sunday of each month. Make sure to read up before you go in. Beautiful and full of story but you might need some background. (but you need it for everywhere)",

          "Spend a couple hours, climb the steps or take the lift to the top of the wall to view the dancing waters and the city. The chateau was renovated several times and the time periods are noted. Well presented and revealing of the history of Nantes. I reccommend as a highlight of",

          "Not really a 'must do' attraction, but worth a short visit and some nice views from the walls. Nice little courtyard to rest in and eat any snack you may be carrying.",
          "We arrived in Nantes to see the Chateau and the next morning after a good nights sleep walked to the Chateau to find it closed. It was closed only on 3 days of the year Xmas dat New Year's Day and the 1st May, yes it was the 1st May, our fiery home was that night. Another try",
          "Stayed in hotel nearby, and visited on the first Sunday of the month, when it is free and open to the public. Very interesting, be sure to wear good walking shoes. It's in very good repair. Be sure to allow at least 1-2 hours for the visit. Staff very helpful, English is",

          "Beautiful chateau right in the heart of the city. You can walk in and around the grounds for free but must pay to enter the chateau itself. We had Nantes Pass so admission was free and included an audioguide. Really interesting artefacts and the history of the city explained as",
          "Visited for an hour or so when in Nantes. Free to look around courtyard and walk around the battlements, which is all we did there. After wondering around, we stopped at the cafe in the courtyard. Crepes were particularly good and not too badly priced either. Just outside the",
          "Brilliant to walk around, beautiful architecture and lovely to sit in the grounds by the moat watching the turtles on a sunny day would definatley recommend to all.",
          "This place is not only a duchess's castle but also the museum of Nantes's history. Inside the castle are the exhibits showing the development of Nantes as an important city in Brittany. If you want to learn more about the castle rather than the city, this place may disappoint",
          "A really wonderful museum is housed within the Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne. Using modern cutting-edge displays, you can trace history in the most wonderful of settings. The displays are all laid out in eras, and you progress through centuries before you hit the end. The cafe",
          "English speaking tour was only was a day, in mornings so we missed it. We walked around, the guided route inside was actually very long there were a lot of detailed information available but unluckily most of it in French.",

          "Great castle in the centre of Nantes just down from the Cathedral. We parked in the Cathedral underground car park - felt very secure. The castle walls are free to go round. There are a lot of stairs but the views and ambience you get are excellent. There are information",
          "Our French friends recommended the Chateau, and we very much enjoyed the museum portion (which is actually focused on the history of Nantes). The Chateau itself is gorgeous, however the internal rooms are remodelled into the museum (not historical rooms of the period).",
          "a great free of charge visit to ancient times - it won't take to the interior rooms, etc, but you can take a tour around the outside walls and view over part of the city. This is a very good idea to get everyone to benefit of this valuable historical monument.",
          "This is in the centre of the City of Nantes and dominates. It is frankly a very impressive lump. The walk around the ramparts is interesting but if you a problem with stairs then that would be challenging. Free to enter",
          "You can visit this castle and watch city from the walls but also you can just sit near the moat and spend some time with friends and good beer :)",
          "In the heart of the city this is a large area of peace and quite. The buildings are imposing and an all round battlement walk is available giving views across the water park. Carefully restored this is an eye opener to the opulence pre revolution.",
          "There are no recreated rooms in this castle but you can walk all around the walls and see great views of the city. This was the one time residence of the Dukes of Brittany. From the gates youncan start your walking tour of the city. Get a map and follow the green line.",

          "Obviously a must see for the castle architecture. Now we have been a little bit disappointed by the visit of the museum. All modern. You then loose what was the castle interior before the museum was built. May be nothing remained. The quality of artwork displayed is on the",
          "It is a great walk highly recommended to families and not only. Just in the heart of the city within easy walking distance from everything (the most central commerce tram station is closed but still it is easily walkable). We decided not to do the inside part of visiting the",
          "Beautiful and imposing architecture and a lot of it to see. We paid to go inside first. Children under 18 go free which is nice incentive, unfortunately they only had guides in French left. You follow the exhibition through about 28 rooms of the castle to learn about the history",
          "We visited only the grounds of the city castle. Touching was the memorial ship made by refugees. This was part of a special exhibition and I'm not sure for how long it will be there.",
          "This is an interesting landmark which offers nice Renaissance architecture, located in the very centre of Nantes, so it\u00b4s quite accesible being the entrance free, unless you visit the museum. I might not be as romantic as some other castles in the region, but it really deserves",
          "The beauty of this castle lies in it's history more than anything else. Looking into the history of 'Bretagne' prior to visiting will set you up nicely for this visit. Walking around the grounds and having a feel for the place is enough for anyone in that context. You can",
          "The gardens in and around the castle are free to walk around and the side of the moat is good for a picnic. Walk around the inner wall for a good view of the area. Went in briefly to the museum which was interesting. The information was mainly in French. For the best view of",
          "We really loved the Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne. We started our day with a guided tour in English (scare enough at most French tourist attractions but not here) and it really set the context for the rest of the day. Once you understand the history of a place, you can really",
          "Very interesting but you require more than couple of hours to do it all. Very well renovated. Quite a lot to learn on the history of the area. However nothing is explained in English. Shame. Tres sympa mais necessite plus de 2 heures pour la visite. Malheureusement aucune",
          "Great sight and view of the walls and courtyard. The large moat is dry, accessible and perfect for pic-nic on the grass. Access to walls, courtyard and moat is free of charge. Inside is paid, but I haven't been.",

          "Great castle and impressive museum. Lots of interactive displays and comprehensive history of the castle and Nantes.",
          "A well preserved french castle, well worth a visit. Combined with a trip to the shops, a lunch or a visit to the Machines de l'isle it makes a good day out.",
          "I went there one afternoon just to check it out because I had time to kill. The grounds are just gorgeous and you dont even have to enter the Chateau to take advantage of the grounds. This is very economical and very nice. Whether you just walk around the grounds or take the",
          "Impressive building, with nice caf\u00e9 bar inside the grounds. Set in the very centre of the town, its well worth a visit.Good gift shop with lots of books about the local history. Lovely rampart walks.",
          "I did not enter as I didn't have enough time but there is much to see from the outside The tourist office is directly opposite so you can gen up before you enter It's worth a visit just to enjoy the grounds and the moat",
          "This is one of the best castles I've been to. Absolutely stunning piece of architecture. You can walk around the outside walls, walk around the moat below, walk inside and also have your picnic in the grounds. Beautiful place - go see.",
          "The chateau is in good repair and well worth a visit. One can walk through the grounds, sit by the moat (which was once part of the Loire) and walk all around the battements for free. There is a museum which is of some interest, but takes a lot of time and an exhibition hall. If",
          "Walking round the ramparts and gardens are free. So it is worth a visit even if you are short of time. If you go into the chateau you can either have headphones or a guided tour. Very absorbing and interesting and worth it, but do be prepared to spend some time.",

          "Gorgeous for a relaxed sunny afternoon visit. Beautifully kept and great veues for free from the top.",
          "Great ch\u00e2teau and former home of the Dukes of Brittany. If you visit this chateau make sure that you walk around the ramparts. You can tour this monument in 1 - 1.5 hours and it is very close to the train station.",

          "2 things rolled into one, a visit to the building itself alongside a very interesting walk through the history of the city. Shows the important role Nantes played in the slave trade.",
          "Lovely Chateau and free to walk around the grounds, you do have to pay to enter the main building, close to the main shopping area and well worth a visit.",
          "Pretty much cool 16th century castle. Well preserved and very clean. Free entrance and walk in the courtyard and the walls. Didn't try to get in to the payed trip inside.",

          "Nice castle to look at for an hour or so. Nothing spectacularly memorable. Lots of stairs around the outside walls, from which there are some good views.",
          "We watched the building from the outside. It shows a lot of prestige...the owners were very important people. A nice moment was when we had a coffee on a terras in front of the building. At that very moment, the sun came finally out !",
          "We had 2 visits to this beautiful chateau in Jan, and were very appreciate that it was open during the winter months, when som many are closed.",

          "This castle is right in the middle of the city and tranforms you, taking you back to the middle ages. It has a real moat and and a great restaurant. you can enter at no cost and walk the grounds but the museum is also worth it!",
          "This is a great attraction that gives a very clear insight into the foundation of this city. As an English speaking person it was unfortunate that the video screenings are not subtitled or shown on a time basis, but don't let that deter you. Take the time to look at the books",
          "Restored just a few years back this castle from the 15th century has a real moat, drawbridge and thick stone walls. Inside is a huge keep with several large buildings. Check out the multi-pulley well. Free admission. Recommended.",

          "The Loire Valley is famous for its ch\u00e2teaux and vineyards. The Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne is the last one on the Loire before it dumps into the Atlantic. The remnants of the moat is interesting and the beauty of the ch\u00e2teau once inside it's walls is surprising. The views from",

          "Easily reached by car with a large underground car park a few minutes walk away. The Chateau is a very interesting place to spend a few hours. Lots to see and plenty of photo opportunities. There is also a museum detailing the history of the region which has signage in several",
          "The Museum is perhaps a little lacking in actual exhibits - lots and lots of maps of Old Nantes, Very Old Nantes, Not Quite So Old Nantes etc, and models, but not a great deal of artefacts. Some gruesome collars and so on put on slaves who misbehaved. It is over many floors,",
          "An excellent museum, well done for all age. I learn a lot about the history of 'Bretagne'. Unfortunately we ran out if time, so allow plenty.",

          "We read about this castle and it was the first thing we came to visit when we arrived in Nantes. We were vacationing in Brittany in the month of March, so there was really no one to buy tickets from or anything. It was as if it was open to the public; so we went exploring.",
          "We had bought a city card but couldn't access the museum on Easter Monday. Walk on walls was good. We used the audio guide to the city which was light on contact but gave basic information.",
          "The museum is well organized and very interesting, with lots of well placed multimedia interpretation throughout. Even touring with active young kids we were able to learn a lot. I appreciated that the museum doesn't shy away from the hard parts of the city's history: slavery,",

          "I love the fact that you can visit rampart of the castle for free during opening hours (and pretend to be a princess), chill out in the grass, look at the ducks and fish that are in the water. There are also lots of concerts in summer and the big fest noz during the Nuits",

          "If you are interested in historic buildings then this is worth a couple of hours of your time. There is a museum contained within but as my time was limited I didn't go in. I was happy enough to absorb the feeling of the structure and to wander around the ramparts, the cost of",

          "The interior of the chateau is a museum of the history of Nantes. There is an excellent audioguide that is available in English. I don't know if other languages were available (other than French, of course!). My wife and I spent at least 4 or 5 hours going through the",
          "Loved to learn about the history of this place, queen Anne of Bretagne and France. Loved the surrounding, the moat, and that they have fruit bearing trees in the courtyard. U fortunately was not able to see the chateau inside, had no time left. Well worth visiting",
          "This is considered the center piece of Nantes, but it really is quite bland. There are, however, many nice shops surrounding the chateau, so it is a good neighborhood to visit. The visitors bureau is directly across the street from this landmark and is worth a stop.",
          "Highly recommend visiting the Chateau that remains standing (renovated) from the Ancient City Wall. You can stroll around the outer walls and gardens or climb up the wall for spectacular views over the city. The museum is open for visitors and cheap for what you learn. There are",
          "We visited on the first Sunday of the month so admission was free. It was also crowded. We rented the Audio Guides and spent about 2 hours walking thru the exhibits in the museum. There are interactive displays with an English option in many of the 32 exhibit rooms and we could",

          "Great castle and the knowledge of the staff is 100% have to say they done great work fix it the last 20 years and the night lights outside castle is great to watch",
          "After having visited so many wondrous chateaux and castles during our 5 week visit to France (especially the Loire Valley), my partner and I found this chateau to be somewhat of a letdown. There just wasn't that much to see. However, it is still worth a visit, just to see how",

          "Imposing architecture, nice view from the ramparts. The place boast a very interesting, well designed historical museum (you'll have to keep climbing steep stairs up and down, though) as well as an art gallery. Plan half a day for an in-depth visit.",
          "The title says it all, I would have preferred a bit more information on the castle's history as we went round though. Watching the duck sunbathe alongside the turtles is worth a watch.",

          "This is a must see attraction if you visit Nantes. We had a most interesting tour of the Chateau, helped by the availability of an audio guide. There is so much history around Nantes and the surrounding area as you will see when you walk through time looking at the exhibits.",
          "This is a must see if you like chateaux. It is different to a lot of the others but has a great walk on the ramparts. True the river has moved so there is not a moat but it is not far from the gare.",
          "We didn't do the paid tour, but it's a very nice place to spend an afternoon. Free walk around the ramparts, a children's maze on the grass, and you can go inside and look at the buildings from the interior.",
          "This is a really interesting place. The walk round the ramparts is free, beautiful and interesting. The museum takes you through the history of Nantes and deserves you spending a good chunk of time to fully appreciate it. I would have liked to see more on WW2 however.",
          "Nice place to walk around or even sit and enjoy the weather. Had some activities for children (not our case but noticed). We didn't visit the museum but did enjoy the view from the ramparts.",
          "I love chateaux. I love Brittany. This chateau is different but still beautiful. Everyone mentions the walk along the ramparts. Yes, it's great. It would have better if they hadn't moved the river years and years ago... I paid for the inside visit. The museum didn't",

          "Walked the ramparts and moat with my 5 yo daugher while my wife shopped. The castle and walls are very impressive, even more so that you do not pay to get in but only to go into the museums inside. Very well signed (in French and English) which is atypical for many French",
          "We started our trip to Nantes at the castle. The free trip around the walls was superb. Great translations of all the key points and superb views. Due to time constraints we didn't visit inside but still spent a great hour immersing in the history of the city",

          "An interesting tour of what i believe is the main feature of Nantes. Great views from the top. Bit of a queue for the museum and exhibitions but worthwhile.",
          "Let me start off by saying that we visited on a Monday and most of France seems to be asleep on every other monday. Even so it was free to walk in and around the chateau including a walk around all of the walls but these are not really high enough to give you breathtaking views",
          "Excellent facility with audio tour guide available covering either the history of the Chateau or of the slave trade. The audio tour includes interactive exhibits. Well worth a visit.",
          "This chateaux was about 100 yds from our hotel. The grounds are free to enter but you pay to see inside the house. We had a stroll around the walls and the moat. It was a fun way to spend an hour. Lots of school trips taking place while we were there so we chose not to enter",
          "At one time this Chateau was on the banks of the Loire, but over time the confluence of the river has been filled in and changed. The ramparts, which are free to walk round, are excellent and go right the way round the castle, giving a good view of the immediate area. From the",
          "The walk around the battlements is free and is worth the effort to get a bird's eye view of the surrounding town. I hoe not to pay the entry price into the museum (had limited time) and perhaps this would have been very good. Lots of people using the grass around the moat for",

          "Outside the restored buildings are beautiful and it is possible to walk on the ramparts and round the moat. Inside the museum, lots of rooms with bits and pieces but the explanations were a bit basic. All in french. Lots of stairs as you start in the basement and work your way",
          "The Chateau of the Dukes (or Duchy) of Brittany is a very imposing monument to a distant age. The building itself is certainly worthy of a visit and careful examination. It is now home to the Nantes History Museum. This latter has been created from a large number of disparate",

          "A really interesting place almost opposite The Okko Hotel. Good for all ages, we saw baby ducks, & turtles with their babies in the moat. It is free entry on the first Sunday of the month. All the family enjoyed.",
          "We found this museum very interesting even though most of the written explanations were in French. There was one book in each area which had a section of English which gave us an historical outline. The chateau building has been beautifully restored and is set up purely as a",
          "Went in for a quick look. Good surprise, the outside walk is free. Thing is, the walk around the walls and battlements is truly fascinating, with great views over the town. Try it, it's not just another chateau.",
          "The whole Chateau site is worth a free visit including the gardens ( pretty and good for a sit down), cafe, walk along the ramparts like a sentry ( great views over Nantes) and the buildings from various eras. We did not attend the special exhibition on Flemish Painters because",

          "This is a very interesting attraction. The chateau and the Museum of Nantes are more or less the same attraction, in that the museum exhibits are arrayed inside the rooms of the chateau. However, the audioguides are separate, with the one for the chateau - which is about 75",
          "You will need to allow yourself quite a few hours for this visit. There are enless rooms detailing the life and history of Anne of Bretagne and the town of Nantes. Unfortunately only having a very basic understanding of French we couldn't read all of the information details for",
          "We did a walking tour of Nantes and came across this unexpected gem. You hear about the many chateaux in the pretty Loire Valley but this one deserves a mention. Massive, stunning, and with round towers, why is it so little known ? Heading west by train, from Nantes station it",
          "Such a lovely place to visit. It has something that will engage young and old, families, couples, and particularly those who have an interest in the history of this region. Wandering around the Chateau's courtyard and walls is free and well worth doing. Pay a modest sum and you",
          "The Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne is a must when visiting the Loire Atlantique region and absolutely splendid for the entire family",
          "Very interesting and interactive visit. There are 30 rooms to visit. You learn all about Nantes the city but also about the origin of its wealth, slavery and about the slave trade. There are guided tours, but all the interactive interpretation panels and computers are sufficient.",
          "Fab. I've been coming to Nantes since I was a young boy. I have always loved the Chateau. Amazingly well preserved and completely user friendly. Plentiful and clean toilet faacilities. The moat has such a wonderful aray of wild life it is lovely to see so many ducks and geese",
          "The museum inside the castle hides it completely so you will be able to see nothing of how a castle is inside, plus none of the museum blabla is really about the castle. What a shame!",

          "From outside the castle looks very beautiful, but inside is modern museum, nothing like an old castle at all. The museum itself is well built and informative, especially if you can understand French. But I was quite dissapointed that the renovation was made with no respect to",
          "This was built as a residence for the Dukes of Brittany. This castle is huge and there are a lot of buildings on the inside that you can tour. Take a walk around the entire castle above the moat to take it all in and then enter the inside. The area around the castle seems to be",
          "Very easy to access, this castle is also free to visit (except museum). The inside, well designed and more \"modern\", is very different than the outside which look more medieval. This castle is a reminder of how powerful and independent Brittany used to be from France. It's a",

          "My boyfriend and I visited the Chateau in October. The chateau from the outside is beautiful. We had a good time, but our only criticism was that it was too modernized inside. It is converted into a museum, but kept very little of the castle charm and inside at times you would",

          "When I visited the Chateau, I had no idea what to expect. The frontage was undergoing renovations, so was not sure what was inside. Inside there was a museum, that was very interactive and told the story of Nantes, from the time of the Romans, to present day. There was a book",
          "In the central square of the Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne is an excellent little restaurant. The quality of the food was really good -we each had an exceptionally delicious vegetarian salad which filled a large plate. You can enter the Chateau without paying the admission fee",

          "Enjoyable chateau in the heart of Nantes. Loads of information and well signed throughout. A little tough if your French isn't great as most signs are in French, however, there is enough english information around to let you know what's happening. There's a lit of stairs, but if",
          "As our stay was short in Nantes, we visited the site of the castle and it was great to be able to enter the courtyard and go onto a portion of the ramparts for free. We didn't have time for the tour of inside the castle but will take more time on our next visit.",
          "This is right in the heart of Nantes which is a stunning city to visit. I dont remember how much is cost to visit but I don't remember being shocked by the prices. The Chateau itself is simply stunning and if it's a nice day it's great to sit in the courtyard and have",
          "Have visited many chateaus in France and castles in the UK, this one has nothing particularly spectacular or interesting to make it stand out. A good visit if you're not a castle fanatic, if you are, probably not worth it.",

          "Fascinating exhibition at an amazing site. But it is long. By the end of the day (with a much needed break for lunch) we did feel we had really acquired an understanding of this beautiful city, the complexities of its geography, it's politics and the darker side of its history.",

          "Nice from outside but not amazing inside. Though they are very child friendly! Full of elevators. And cheap.",
          "From the outside, this castle/chateau is wonderful. It sports a great moat and crenelated towers at the corners of its massive walls. We joined the locals by having a picnic lunch on the grass along side the moat. Once inside, there is little to see, as the centuries have taken",
          "The views from the walls of the chateau are genuinely awesome, and fantastic photos await you at every turn. However, in typical French style, there aren't a lot of railings and some of the heights are almost nauseating if you have issues with heights. I couldn't believe that",

          "Interesting for its temporary exhibitions but the permanent collections are presented in a very weird way. Probably one of the least appealing museums we have visited in Europe.",
          "I enjoyed learning about the history of Nantes. An exhibit on Anne of Brittany included the relic containing her heart. The section on the history of slave trade on Nantes was enlightening. It was worth the money to take the tour.",

          "This well designed and well-interpreted museum isn't one of France's high profile attractions, but it was more than worth the time we spent and the price of entry. It's mostly a city museum, but in the process of telling that story, they explain a whole lot of French history",
          "We saw both the World Wars exhibit and the Nantes history museum. Both were very well planned and organized. The exhibits were interesting and paced so that one can read more or less, taking in the right amount on the visit. We had lunch at the restaurant and a walk around the",

        "wiki": "Nantes (, also US: , French: [n\u0251\u0303t] (listen); Gallo: Naunnt or Nantt [n\u0251\u0303(\u02d0)t]; Breton: Naoned [\u02c8n\u00e3un\u0259t]) is a city in Loire-Atlantique on the Loire, 50 km (31 mi) from the Atlantic coast. The city is the sixth-largest in France, with a population of  303,382 in Nantes and a metropolitan area of nearly 950,000 inhabitants. With Saint-Nazaire, a seaport on the Loire estuary, Nantes forms the main north-western French metropolis.\nIt is the administrative seat of the Loire-Atlantique department and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion, one of 18 regions of France. Nantes belongs historically and culturally to Brittany, a former duchy and province, and its omission from the modern administrative region of Brittany is controversial.\nNantes was identified during classical antiquity as a port on the Loire. It was the seat of a bishopric at the end of the Roman era before it was conquered by the Bretons in 851. Although Nantes was the primary residence of the 15th-century dukes of Brittany, Rennes became the provincial capital after the 1532 union of Brittany and France. During the 17th century, after the establishment of the French colonial empire, Nantes gradually became the largest port in France and was responsible for nearly half of the  18th-century French Atlantic slave trade. The French Revolution resulted in an economic decline, but Nantes developed robust industries after 1850 (chiefly in shipbuilding and food processing). Deindustrialisation in the second half of the 20th century spurred the city to adopt a service economy.\nIn 2012, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Nantes as a Gamma world city. It is the fourth-highest-ranking city in France, after Paris, Lyon and Marseille. The Gamma category includes cities such as Algiers, Orlando, Porto, Turin and Leipzig. Nantes has been praised for its quality of life, and it received the European Green Capital Award in 2013. The European Commission noted the city's efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, its high-quality and well-managed public transport system and its biodiversity, with 3,366 hectares (8,320 acres) of green space and several protected Natura 2000 areas.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nNantes is named after a tribe of Gaul, the Namnetes, who established a settlement between the end of the second century and the beginning of the first century BC on the north bank of the Loire near its confluence with the Erdre. The origin of the name \"Namnetes\" is uncertain, but is thought to come from the Gaulish root *nant- (river or stream, from the pre-Celtic root *nanto, valley) or from Amnites, another tribal name possibly meaning \"men of the river\".Its first recorded name was by the Greek writer Ptolemy, who referred to the settlement as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00fainkon) and \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kondio\u00fainkon)\u2014which might be read as \u039a\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b7\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (Kond\u0113o\u00faikon)\u2014in his treatise, Geography. The name was latinised during the Gallo-Roman period as Condevincum (the most common form), Condevicnum, Condivicnum and Condivincum. Although its origins are unclear, \"Condevincum\" seems to be related to the Gaulish word condate \"confluence\".The Namnete root of the city's name was introduced at the end of the Roman period, when it became known as Portus Namnetum \"port of the Namnetes\" and civitas Namnetum \"city of the Namnetes\". Like other cities in the region (including Paris), its name was replaced during the fourth century with a Gaulish one; Lutetia became Paris (city of the Parisii), and Darioritum became Vannes (city of the Veneti). Nantes' name continued to evolve, becoming Naneti\u00e6 and Namnetis during the fifth century and Nantes after the sixth, via syncope (suppression of the middle syllable).\n\n\n=== Modern pronunciation and nicknames ===\nNantes is pronounced [n\u0251\u0303t], and the city's inhabitants are known as Nantais [n\u0251\u0303t\u025b]. In Gallo, the o\u00efl language traditionally spoken in the region around Nantes, the city is spelled Naunnt or Nantt and pronounced identically to French, although northern speakers use a long [\u0251\u0303]. In Breton, Nantes is known as Naoned or an Naoned, the latter of which is less common and reflects the more-frequent use of articles in Breton toponyms than in French ones.Nantes' historical nickname was \"Venice of the West\" (French: la Venise de l'Ouest), a reference to the many quays and river channels in the old town before they were filled in during the 1920s and 1930s. The city is commonly known as la Cit\u00e9 des Ducs \"the City of the Dukes [of Brittany]\" for its castle and former role as a ducal residence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\n\nThe first inhabitants of what is now Nantes settled during the Bronze Age, later than in the surrounding regions (which have Neolithic monuments absent from Nantes). Its first inhabitants were apparently attracted by small iron and tin deposits in the region's subsoil. The area exported tin, mined in Abbaretz and Piriac, as far as Ireland. After about 1,000 years of trading, local industry appeared around 900 BC; remnants of smithies dated to the eighth and seventh centuries BC have been found in the city. Nantes may have been the major Gaulish settlement of Corbilo, on the Loire estuary, which was mentioned by the Greek historians Strabo and Polybius.Its history from the seventh century to the Roman conquest in the first century BC is poorly documented, and there is no evidence of a city in the area before the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD. During the Gaulish period it was the capital of the Namnetes people, who were allied with the Veneti in a territory extending to the northern bank of the Loire. Rivals in the area included the Pictones, who controlled the area south of the Loire in the city of Ratiatum (present-day Rez\u00e9) until the end of the second century AD. Ratiatum, founded under Augustus, developed more quickly than Nantes and was a major port in the region. Nantes began to grow when Ratiatum collapsed after the Germanic invasions.Because tradesmen favoured inland roads rather than Atlantic routes, Nantes never became a large city under Roman occupation. Although it lacked amenities such as a theatre or an amphitheatre, the city had sewers, public baths and a temple dedicated to Mars Mullo. After an attack by German tribes in 275, Nantes' inhabitants built a wall; this defense also became common in surrounding Gaulish towns. The wall in Nantes, enclosing 16 hectares (40 acres), was one of the largest in Gaul.Christianity was introduced during the third century. The first local martyrs (Donatian and Rogatian) were executed in 288\u2013290, and a cathedral was built during the fourth century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nLike much of the region, Nantes was part of the Roman Empire during the early Middle Ages. Although many parts of Brittany experienced significant Breton immigration (loosening ties to Rome), Nantes remained allied with the empire until its collapse in the fifth century. Around 490, the Franks under Clovis I captured the city (alongside eastern Brittany) from the Visigoths after a sixty-day siege; it was used as a stronghold against the Bretons. Under Charlemagne in the eighth century the town was the capital of the Breton March, a buffer zone protecting the Carolingian Empire from Breton invasion. The first governor of the Breton March was Roland, whose feats were mythologized in the body of literature known as the Matter of France. After Charlemagne's death in 814,  Breton armies invaded the March and fought the Franks. Nominoe (a Breton) became the first duke of Brittany, seizing Nantes in 850. Discord marked the first decades of Breton rule in Nantes as Breton lords fought among themselves, making the city vulnerable to Viking incursions. The most spectacular Viking attack in Nantes occurred in 843, when Viking warriors killed the bishop but did not settle in the city at that time. Nantes became part of the Viking realm in 919, but the Norse were expelled from the town in 937 by Alan II, Duke of Brittany.Feudalism took hold in France during the 10th and 11th centuries, and Nantes was the seat of a county founded in the ninth century. Until the beginning of the 13th century, it was the subject of succession crises which saw the town pass several times from the Dukes of Brittany to the counts of Anjou (of the House of Plantagenet). During the 14th century, Brittany experienced a war of succession which ended with the accession of the House of Montfort to the ducal throne. The Montforts, seeking emancipation from the suzerainty of the French kings, reinforced Breton institutions. They chose Nantes, the largest town in Brittany (with a population of over 10,000), as their main residence and made it the home of their council, their treasury and their chancery. Port traffic, insignificant during the Middle Ages, became the city's main activity. Nantes began to trade with foreign countries, exporting salt from Bourgneuf, wine, fabrics and hemp (usually to the British Isles). The 15th century is considered Nantes' first golden age. The reign of Francis II saw many improvements to a city in dire need of repair after the wars of succession and a series of storms and fires between 1387 and 1415. Many buildings were built or rebuilt (including the cathedral and the castle), and the University of Nantes, the first in Brittany, was founded in 1460.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nThe marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1491 began the unification of France and Brittany which was ratified by Francis I of France in 1532. The union ended a long feudal conflict between France and Brittany, reasserting the king's suzerainty over the Bretons. In return for surrendering its independence, Brittany retained its privileges. Although most Breton institutions were maintained, the unification favoured Rennes (the site of ducal coronations). Rennes received most legal and administrative institutions, and Nantes kept a financial role with its Chamber of Accounts. At the end of the French Wars of Religion, the Edict of Nantes (legalising Protestantism in France) was signed in the town. However, the edict did not reflect local opinion in the Catholic League stronghold. The local Protestant community did not number more than 1,000, and Nantes was one of the last places to resist the authority of Protestant-raised Henry IV. The edict was signed after the capitulation of the Duke of Merc\u0153ur, governor of Brittany.Coastal navigation and the export of locally produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, and it was the largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo dye, coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.Manufactured goods were more lucrative than raw materials during the 18th century. There were about fifteen sugar refineries in the city around 1750 and nine cotton mills in 1786. Nantes and its surrounding area were the main producers of French printed cotton fabric during the 18th century, and the Netherlands was the city's largest client for exotic goods. Although trade brought wealth to Nantes, the city was confined by its walls; their removal during the 18th century allowed it to expand. Neoclassical squares and public buildings were constructed, and wealthy merchants built sumptuous h\u00f4tels particuliers.\n\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nThe French Revolution initially received some support in Nantes, a bourgeois city rooted in private enterprise. On 18 July 1789, locals seized the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany in an imitation of the storming of the Bastille. Rural western France, Catholic and conservative, strongly opposed the abolition of the monarchy and the submission of the clergy. A rebellion in the neighbouring Vend\u00e9e began in 1793, quickly spreading to surrounding regions. Nantes was an important Republican garrison on the Loire en route to England. On 29 June 1793, 30,000 Royalist troops from Vend\u00e9e attacked the city on their way to Normandy (where they hoped to receive British support). Twelve thousand Republican soldiers resisted and the Battle of Nantes resulted in the death of Royalist leader Jacques Cathelineau. Three years later another Royalist leader, Fran\u00e7ois de Charette, was executed in Nantes.After the Battle of Nantes, the National Convention (which had founded the First French Republic) decided to purge the city of its anti-revolutionary elements. Nantes was seen by the convention as a corrupt merchant city; the local elite was less supportive of the French Revolution, since its growing centralisation reduced their influence. From October 1793 to February 1794, deputy Jean-Baptiste Carrier presided over a revolutionary tribunal notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness. Between 12,000 and 13,000 people (including women and children) were arrested, and 8,000 to 11,000 died of typhus or were executed by the guillotine, shooting or drowning. The Drownings at Nantes were intended to kill large numbers of people simultaneously, and Carrier called the Loire \"the national bathtub\".The French Revolution was disastrous for the local economy. The slave trade nearly disappeared because of the abolition of slavery and the independence of Saint-Domingue, and Napoleon's Continental Blockade decimated trade with other European countries. Nantes never fully recovered its 18th-century wealth; the port handled 43,242 tons of goods in 1807, down from 237,716 tons in 1790.\n\n\n=== Industries ===\n\nOutlawed by the French Revolution, the slave trade re-established itself as Nantes' major source of income in the first decades of the 19th century. It was the last French port to conduct the illegal Atlantic trade, continuing it until about 1827. The 19th-century slave trade may have been as extensive as that of the previous century, with about 400,000 slaves deported to the colonies. Businessmen took advantage of local vegetable production and Breton fishing to develop a canning industry during the 1820s, but canning was eclipsed by sugar imported from R\u00e9union in the 1840s and 1850s. Nantes tradesmen received a tax rebate on R\u00e9union sugar, which was lucrative until disease devastated the cane plantations in 1863. By the mid-19th century, Le Havre and Marseille were the two main French ports; the former traded with America and the latter with Asia. They had embraced the Industrial Revolution, thanks to Parisian investments; Nantes lagged behind, struggling to find profitable activities. Nostalgic for the pre-revolutionary golden age, the local elite had been suspicious of political and technological progress during the first half of the 19th century. In 1851, after much debate and opposition, Nantes was connected to Paris by the Tours\u2013Saint-Nazaire railway.Nantes became a major industrial city during the second half of the 19th century with the aid of several families who invested in successful businesses. In 1900, the city's two main industries were food processing and shipbuilding. The former, primarily the canning industry, included the biscuit manufacturer LU and the latter was represented by three shipyards which were among the largest in France. These industries helped maintain port activity and facilitated agriculture, sugar imports, fertilizer production, machinery and metallurgy, which employed 12,000 people in Nantes and its surrounding area in 1914. Because large, modern ships had increased difficulty traversing the Loire to reach Nantes, a new port in Saint-Nazaire had been established at the mouth of the estuary in 1835. Saint-Nazaire, primarily developed for goods to be transhipped before being sent to Nantes, also built rival shipyards. Saint-Nazaire surpassed Nantes in port traffic for the first time in 1868. Reacting to the growth of the rival port, Nantes built a 15 kilometres (9.3 miles)-long canal parallel to the Loire to remain accessible to large ships. The canal, completed in 1892, was abandoned in 1910 because of the efficient dredging of the Loire between 1903 and 1914.\n\n\n=== Land reclamation ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the river channels flowing through Nantes were increasingly perceived as hampering the city's comfort and economic development. Sand siltation required dredging, which weakened the quays; one quay collapsed in 1924. Embankments were overcrowded with railways, roads and tramways. Between 1926 and 1946, most of the channels were filled in and their water diverted. Large thoroughfares replaced the channels, altering the urban landscape. Feydeau and Gloriette Islands in the old town were attached to the north bank, and the other islands in the Loire were formed into the Isle of Nantes.When the land reclamation was almost complete, Nantes was shaken by the air raids of the Second World War. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 18 June 1940, during the Battle of France. Forty-eight civilians were executed in Nantes in 1941 in retaliation for the assassination of German officer Karl Hotz. They are remembered as \"the 50 hostages\" because the Germans initially planned to kill 50 people. British bombs first hit the city in August 1941 and May 1942. The main attacks occurred on 16 and 23 September 1943, when most of Nantes' industrial facilities and portions of the city centre and its surrounding area were destroyed by American bombs. About 20,000 people were left homeless by the 1943 raids, and 70,000 subsequently left the city. Allied raids killed 1,732 people and destroyed 2,000 buildings in Nantes, leaving a further 6,000 buildings unusable. The Germans abandoned the city on 12 August 1944, and it was recaptured without a fight by the French Forces of the Interior and the U.S. Army.\n\n\n=== Postwar ===\nThe postwar years were a period of strikes and protests in Nantes. A strike organised by the city's 17,500 metallurgists during the summer of 1955 to protest salary disparities between Paris and the rest of France deeply impacted the French political scene, and their action was echoed in other cities. Nantes saw other large strikes and demonstrations during the May 1968 events, when marches drew about 20,000 people into the streets. The 1970s global recession brought a large wave of deindustrialisation to France, and Nantes saw the closure of many factories and the city's shipyards. The 1970s and 1980s were primarily a period of economic stagnation for Nantes. During the 1980s and 1990s its economy became service-oriented and it experienced economic growth under Jean-Marc Ayrault, the city's mayor from 1989 to 2012. Under Ayrault's administration, Nantes used its quality of life to attract service firms. The city developed a rich cultural life, advertising itself as a creative place near the ocean. Institutions and facilities (such as its airport) were re-branded as \"Nantes Atlantique\" to highlight this proximity. Local authorities have commemorated the legacy of the slave trade, promoting dialogue with other cultures.Nantes has been noted in recent years for its climate of social unrest, marked by frequent and often violent clashes between protesters and police. Tear gas is frequently deployed during protests.The city has a significant ultra-left radical scene, owing in part to the proximity of the ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes. Masked rioters have repeatedly ransacked shops, offices and public transport infrastructure.The death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o in June 2019 has led to accusations of police brutality and cover-ups.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nNantes is in north-western France, near the Atlantic Ocean and 342 kilometres (213 miles) south-west of Paris. Bordeaux, the other major metropolis of western France, is  274 kilometres (170 miles) south. Nantes and Bordeaux share positions at the mouth of an estuary, and Nantes is on the Loire estuary.The city is at a natural crossroads between the ocean in the west, the centre of France (towards Orl\u00e9ans) in the east, Brittany in the north and Vend\u00e9e (on the way to Bordeaux) in the south. It is an architectural junction; northern French houses with slate roofs are north of the Loire, and Mediterranean dwellings with low terracotta roofs dominate the south bank. The Loire is also the northern limit of grape culture. Land north of Nantes is dominated by bocage and dedicated to polyculture and animal husbandry, and the south is renowned for its Muscadet vineyards and market gardens. The city is near the geographical centre of the land hemisphere, identified in 1945 by Samuel Boggs as near the main railway station (around 47\u00b013\u2032N 1\u00b032\u2032W).\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\nThe Loire is about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) long and its estuary, beginning in Nantes, is 60 kilometres (37 miles) in length. The river's bed and banks have  changed considerably over a period of centuries. In Nantes the Loire had divided into a number of channels, creating a dozen islands and sand ridges. They facilitated crossing the river, contributing to the city's growth. Most of the islands were protected with levees during the modern era, and they disappeared in the 1920s and 1930s when the smallest waterways were filled in. The Loire in Nantes now has only two branches, one on either side of the Isle of Nantes.The river is tidal in the city, and tides are observed about 30 kilometres (19 miles) further east. The tidal range can reach 6 metres (20 feet) in Nantes, larger than at the mouth of the estuary. This is the result of 20th-century dredging to make Nantes accessible by large ships; tides were originally much weaker. Nantes was at the point where the river current and the tides cancelled each other out, resulting in siltation and the formation of the original islands.The city is at the confluence of two tributaries. The Erdre flows into the Loire from its north bank, and the S\u00e8vre Nantaise flows into the Loire from its south bank. These two rivers initially provided natural links with the hinterland. When the channels of the Loire were filled, the Erdre was diverted in central Nantes and its confluence with the Loire was moved further east. The Erdre includes Versailles Island, which became a Japanese garden during the 1980s. It was created in the 19th century with fill from construction of the Nantes-Brest canal.\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nNantes is built on the Armorican Massif, a range of weathered mountains which may be considered the backbone of Brittany. The mountains, stretching from the end of the Breton peninsula to the outskirts of the sedimentary Paris Basin, are composed of several parallel ridges of Ordovician and Cadomian rocks. Nantes is where one of these ridges, the Sillon de Bretagne, meets the Loire. It passes through the western end of the old town, forming a series of cliffs above the quays. The end of the ridge, the Butte Sainte-Anne, is a natural landmark 38 metres (125 feet) above sea level; its foothills are at an elevation of 15 metres (49 feet).The Sillon de Bretagne is composed of granite; the rest of the region is a series of low plateaus covered with silt and clay, with mica schist and sediments found in lower areas. Much of the old town and all of the Isle of Nantes consist of backfill. Elevations in Nantes are generally higher in the western neighbourhoods on the Sillon, reaching 52 metres (171 feet) in the north-west. The Erdre flows through a slate fault. Eastern Nantes is flatter, with a few hills reaching 30 metres (98 feet). The city's lowest points, along the Loire, are 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nNantes has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb) influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. West winds produced by cyclonic depressions in the Atlantic dominate, and north and north-west winds are also common. The climatic conditions allow to be typically in this zone with almost no influence of the continent as in Paris, the city has strict variations of temperatures and few freezing days in average annual, in addition to a precipitation higher, but also being able to be described informally as a \"Mediterranean altered\" for 1971-2000 normals. Rainfall and its pattern exemplifies this (winters rainier than other seasons), although it is a relatively high total fall in every month (too high average temperature), but in the future may be closer to a dry summer defined if trends persist. Slight variations in elevation make fog common in valleys, and slopes oriented south and south-west have good insolation. Winters are cool and rainy, with an average temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F); snow is rare. Summers are warm, with an average temperature of 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F). Rain is abundant through the year, with an annual average of 820 millimetres (32 inches). The climate in Nantes is suitable for growing a variety of plants, from temperate vegetables to exotic trees and flowers imported during the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n\nNantes' layout is typical of French towns and cities. It has a historical centre with old monuments, administrative buildings and small shops, surrounded by 19th-century faubourgs surrounded by newer suburban houses and public housing. The city centre has a medieval core (corresponding to the former walled town) and 18th-century extensions running west and east. The northern extension, Marchix, was considered squalid and nearly disappeared during the 20th century. The old town did not extend south before the 19th century, since it would have meant building on the unsteady islands in the Loire.The medieval core has narrow streets and a mixture of half-timbered buildings, more recent sandstone buildings, post-World War II reconstruction and modern redevelopment. It is primarily a student neighbourhood, with many bars and small shops. The eastern extension (behind Nantes Cathedral) was traditionally inhabited by the aristocracy, and the larger western extension along the Loire was built for the bourgeoisie. It is Nantes' most-expensive area, with wide avenues, squares and h\u00f4tels particuliers. The area was extended towards the Parc de Proc\u00e9 during the 19th century. The other faubourgs were built along the main boulevards and the plateaus, turning the valleys into parks. Outside central Nantes several villages, including Chantenay, Doulon, L'Eraudi\u00e8re and Saint-Joseph-de-Porterie, were absorbed by urbanisation.\n\nAfter World War II, several housing projects were built to accommodate Nantes' growing population. The oldest, Les Dervalli\u00e8res, was developed in 1956 and was followed by Bellevue in 1959 and Le Breil and Malakoff in 1971. Once areas of poverty, they are experiencing regeneration since the 2000s. The northern outskirts of the city, along the Erdre, include the main campus of the University of Nantes and other institutes of higher education. During the second half of the 20th century, Nantes expanded south into the communes of Rez\u00e9, Vertou and Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire (across the Loire but near the city centre) and  north-bank communes including Saint-Herblain, Orvault and Sainte-Luce-sur-Loire.The 4.6-square-kilometre (1.8 sq mi) Isle of Nantes is divided between former shipyards on the west, an old faubourg in its centre and modern housing estates on the east. Since the 2000s, it has been subject to the conversion of former industrial areas into office space, housing and leisure facilities. Local authorities intend to make it an extension of the city centre. Further development is also planned on the north bank along an axis linking the train station and the Loire.\n\n\n=== Parks and environment ===\n\nNantes has 100 public parks, gardens and squares covering 218 hectares (540 acres). The oldest is the Jardin des Plantes, a botanical garden created in 1807. It has a large collection of exotic plants, including a 200-year-old Magnolia grandiflora and the national collection of camellia. Other large parks include the Parc de Proc\u00e9, Parc du Grand Blottereau and Parc de la Gaudini\u00e8re, the former gardens of country houses built outside the old town. Natural areas, an additional 180 hectares (440 acres), include the Petite Amazonie (a Natura 2000 protected forest) and several woods, meadows and marshes. Green space (public and private) makes up 41 percent of Nantes' area.The city adopted an ecological framework in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases and promote energy transition. Nantes has three ecodistricts (one on the Isle of Nantes, one near the train station and the third in the north-east of the city), which aim to provide affordable, ecological housing and counter urban sprawl by redeveloping neglected areas of the city.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nNantes is the pr\u00e9fecture (capital city) of the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement and the Pays de la Loire r\u00e9gion. It is the residence of a r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement prefect, local representatives of the French government. Nantes is also the meeting place of the r\u00e9gion and d\u00e9partement councils, two elected political bodies.\nThe city is administered by a mayor and a council, elected every six years. The council has 65 councillors. It originated in 1410, when John V, Duke of Brittany created the Burghers' Council. The assembly was controlled by wealthy merchants and the Lord Lieutenant. After the union of Brittany and France, the burghers petitioned the French king to give them a city council which would enhance their freedom; their request was granted by Francis II in 1559. The new council had a mayor, ten aldermen and a crown prosecutor. The first council was elected in 1565 with Nantes' first mayor, Geoffroy Drouet. The present city council is a result of the French Revolution and a 4 December 1789 act. The current mayor of Nantes is Johanna Rolland (Socialist Party), who was elected on 4 April 2014. The party has held a majority since 1983, and Nantes has become a left-wing stronghold.Since 1995 Nantes has been divided into 11 neighbourhoods (quartiers), each with an advisory committee and administrative agents. City-council members are appointed to each  quartier to consult with the local committees. The neighbourhood committees, existing primarily to facilitate dialogue between citizens and the local government, meet twice a year.Like most French municipalities, Nantes is part of an intercommunal structure which combines the city with 24 smaller, neighbouring communes. Called Nantes M\u00e9tropole, it encompasses the city's metropolitan area and had a population of 609,198 in 2013. Nantes M\u00e9tropole administers urban planning, transport, public areas, waste disposal, energy, water, housing, higher education, economic development, employment and European topics. As a consequence, the city council's mandates are security, primary and secondary education, early childhood, social aid, culture, sport and health. Nantes M\u00e9tropole, created in 1999, is administered by a council consisting of the 97 members of the local municipal councils. According to an act passed in 2014, beginning in 2020 the metropolitan council will be elected by the citizens of Nantes M\u00e9tropole. The council is currently overseen by Rolland.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nLocal authorities began using official symbols in the 14th century, when the provost commissioned a seal on which the Duke of Brittany stood on a boat and protected Nantes with his sword. The present coat of arms was first used in 1514; its ermines symbolise Brittany, and its green waves suggest the Loire.Nantes' coat of arms had ducal emblems before the French Revolution: the belt cord of the Order of the Cord (founded by Anne of Brittany) and the city's coronet. The coronet was replaced by a mural crown during the 18th century, and during the revolution a new emblem with a statue of Liberty replaced the coat of arms. During Napoleon's rule the coat of arms returned, with bees (a symbol of his empire) added to the chief. The original coat of arms was readopted in 1816, and the Liberation Cross and the 1939\u201345 War Cross were added in 1948.Before the revolution, Nantes' motto was \"Oculi omnium in te sperant, Domine\" (\"The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord\", a line from a grace). It disappeared during the revolution, and the city adopted its current motto\u2014\"Favet Neptunus eunti\" (\"Neptune favours the traveller\")\u2014in 1816. Nantes' flag is derived from the naval jack flown by Breton vessels before the French Revolution. The flag has a white cross on a black one; its quarters have Breton ermines except for the upper left, which has the city's coat of arms. The black and white crosses are historic symbols of Brittany and France, respectively.\n\n\n=== Nantes and Brittany ===\n\nNantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were part of the historic province of Brittany, and the city and Rennes were its traditional capitals. In the 1789 replacement of the historic provinces of France, Brittany was divided among five d\u00e9partements. The administrative region of Brittany did not exist during the 19th and early 20th centuries, although its cultural heritage remained. Nantes and Rennes are in Upper Brittany (the Romance-speaking part of the region), and Lower Brittany in the west is traditionally Breton-speaking and more Celtic in culture. As a large port whose outskirts encompassed other provinces, Nantes has been Brittany's economic capital and a cultural crossroads. Breton culture in Nantes is not necessarily characteristic of Lower Brittany's, although the city experienced substantial Lower Breton immigration during the 19th century.In the mid-20th century, several French governments considered creating a new level of local government by combining d\u00e9partements into larger regions. The regions, established by acts of parliament in 1955 and 1972, loosely follow the pre-revolutionary divisions and Brittany was revived as Region Brittany. Nantes and the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement were not included, because each new region centred on one metropolis. Region Brittany was created around Rennes, similar in size to Nantes; the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement formed a new region with four other d\u00e9partements, mainly portions of the old provinces of Anjou, Maine and Poitou. The new region was called Pays de la Loire (\"Loire Countries\") although it does not include most of the Loire Valley. It has often been said that the separation of Nantes from the rest of Brittany was decided by Vichy France during the Second World War. Philippe P\u00e9tain created a new Brittany without Nantes in 1941, but his region disappeared after the liberation.Debate continues about Nantes' place in Brittany, with polls indicating a large majority in Loire-Atlantique and throughout the historic province favouring Breton reunification. In a 2014 poll, 67 percent of Breton people and 77 percent of Loire-Atlantique residents favoured reunification. Opponents, primarily Pays de la Loire officials, say that their region could not exist economically without Nantes. Pays de la Loire officials favour a union of Brittany with the Pays de la Loire, but Breton politicians oppose the incorporation of their region into a Greater West region. Nantes' city council has acknowledged the fact that the city is culturally part of Brittany, but its position on reunification is  similar to that of the Pays de la Loire. City officials tend to consider Nantes an open metropolis with its own personality, independent of surrounding regions.\n\n\n=== Twinning ===\n\nNantes has made nine international sister-city arrangements since 1964. Arrangements have been made with:\nCardiff, Wales (1964)\nSaarbr\u00fccken, Germany (1965)\nTbilisi, Georgia (1979)\nSeattle and Jacksonville, Florida (1980-1984)\nCluj-Napoca, Romania (1991)\nNiigata, Niigata, Japan (1999)\nDurban, South Africa (2005)\nQingdao, China (2005)\nSuncheon, Jeonnam, South Korea (2007)The city has made agreements with other cities and regions, including Turin, Liverpool, Hamburg, Asturias and Quebec. Partnership agreements have been signed with cities in developing countries, including Dschang, Cameroon, Grand'Anse, Haiti and Kindia, Guinea.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nNantes had 298,029 inhabitants in 2016, the largest population in its history. Although it was the largest city in Brittany during the Middle Ages, it was smaller than three other north-western towns: Angers, Tours and Caen. Nantes has experienced consistent growth since the Middle Ages, except during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon I (when it experienced depopulation, primarily due to the Continental System). In 1500, the city had a population of around 14,000. Nantes' population increased to 25,000 in 1600 and to 80,000 in 1793. In 1800 it was the sixth-largest French city, behind Paris (550,000), Lyon, Marseilles, Bordeaux and Rouen (all 80,000 to 109,000). Population growth continued through the 19th century; although other European cities experienced increased growth due to industrialisation, in Nantes growth remained at its 18th-century pace. Nantes reached the 100,000 mark about 1850, and 130,000 around 1900. In 1908 it annexed the neighbouring communes of Doulon and Chantenay, gaining almost 30,000 inhabitants. Population growth was slower during the 20th century, remaining under 260,000 from the 1960s to the 2000s primarily because urban growth spread to surrounding communes. Since 2000 the population of Nantes began to rise due to redevelopment, and its urban area has continued to experience population growth. The Nantes metropolitan area had a population of 907,995 in 2013, nearly doubling since the 1960s. Its population is projected to reach one million by 2030, based on the fertility rate.The population of Nantes is younger than the national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 percent of the population over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity, religions and languages ===\n\nNantes has long had ethnic minorities. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian communities were mentioned during the 16th century, and an Irish Jacobite community appeared a century later. However, immigration has always been lower in Nantes than in other large French cities. The city's foreign population has been stable since 1990, half the average for other French cities of similar size. France does not have ethnic or religious categories in its census, but counts the number of people born in a foreign country. In 2013 this category had 24,949 people in Nantes, or 8.5 percent of the total population. The majority (60.8 percent) were 25 to 54 years old. Their primary countries of origin were Algeria (13.9 percent), Morocco (11.4 percent) and Tunisia (5.8 percent). Other African countries accounted for 24.9 percent, the European Union 15.6 percent, the rest of Europe 4.8 percent and Turkey 4.3 percent.Nantes is historically a Catholic city, with a cathedral, two minor basilicas, about 40 churches and around 20 chapels. Western France is traditionally religious, and the Catholic influence on Nantes was more persistent than in other large French cities. However, it has waned since the 1970s because of the rise of atheism and secularism. Although Nantes is where Protestantism was permitted in France through its edict, Protestants have always formed a small minority. The main Protestant church belongs to the United Protestant Church of France, but the city also has a number of newer Evangelical and Baptist churches. Nantes had a small Jewish community during the Middle Ages, but Jews were expelled from Brittany in 1240 and Judaism only reappeared after the French Revolution. The city has one synagogue, built in 1852. The city had several hundred Muslim inhabitants during the 1950s, but (as in the rest of France) their number increased in the second half of the 20th century with the arrival of large numbers of Africans and Turks. Nantes' first mosque was built in 1976, with three more built in 2010\u20132012.The city is part of the territory of the langues d'o\u00efl, a dialect continuum which stretches across northern France and includes standard French. The local dialect in Nantes is Gallo, spoken by some in Upper Brittany. Nantes, as a large city, has been a stronghold of standard French. A local dialect (parler nantais) is sometimes mentioned by the press, but its existence is dubious and its vocabulary mainly the result of rural emigration. As a result of 19th-century Lower Breton immigration, Breton was once widely spoken in parts of Nantes. Nantes signed the charter of the Public Office for the Breton Language in 2013. Since then, the city has supported its six bilingual schools and introduced bilingual signage.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nFor centuries, Nantes' economy was linked to the Loire and the Atlantic; the city had France's largest harbour in the 18th century. Food processing predominated during the Industrial Age, with sugar refineries (Beghin-Say), biscuit factories (LU and BN Biscuit), canned fish (Saupiquet and Tipiak) and processed vegetables (Bonduelle and Cassegrain); these brands still dominate the French market. The Nantes region is France's largest food producer; the city has recently become a hub of innovation in food security, with laboratories and firms such as Eurofins Scientific.Nantes experienced deindustrialisation after port activity in Saint-Nazaire largely ceased, culminating in the 1987 closure of the shipyards. At that time, the city attempted to attract service firms. Nantes capitalised on its culture and proximity to the sea to present itself as creative and modern. Capgemini (management consulting), SNCF (rail) and Bouygues Telecom opened large offices in the city, followed by smaller companies. Since 2000 Nantes has developed a business district, Euronantes, with 500,000 square metres (5,400,000 square feet) of office space and 10,000 jobs. Although its stock exchange was merged with that of Paris in 1990, Nantes is the third-largest financial centre in France after Paris and Lyon.\n\nThe city has one of the best-performing economies in France, producing \u20ac55 billion annually; \u20ac29 billion returns to the local economy. Nantes has over 25,000 businesses with 167,000 jobs, and its metropolitan area has 42,000 firms and 328,000 jobs. The city is one of France's most dynamic in job creation, with 19,000 jobs created in Nantes M\u00e9tropole between 2007 and 2014 (outperforming larger cities such as Marseilles, Lyon and Nice). The communes surrounding Nantes have industrial estates and retail parks, many along the region's ring road. The metropolitan area has ten large shopping centres; the largest, Atlantis in Saint-Herblain, is a mall with 116 shops and several superstores (including IKEA). The shopping centres threaten independent shops in central Nantes, but it remains the region's largest retail area  with about 2,000 shops. Tourism is a growing sector and Nantes, with two million visitors annually, is France's seventh-most-visited city.In 2014, 74.6 percent of the city's businesses were involved in trade, transport and services; 16.2 percent in administration, education and health; 5.4 percent in construction, and 3.7 percent in industry. Although industry is less significant than it was before the 1970s, Nantes is France's second-largest centre for aeronautics. The European company Airbus produces its fleet's wingboxes and radomes in Nantes, employing about 2,000 people. The city's remaining port terminal still handles wood, sugar, fertilizer, metals, sand and cereals, ten percent of the total Nantes\u2013Saint-Nazaire harbour traffic (along the Loire estuary). The Atlanpole technopole, in northern Nantes on its border with Carquefou, intends to develop technological and science sectors throughout the Pays de la Loire. With a business incubator, it has 422 companies and 71 research and higher-education facilities and specialises in biopharmaceuticals, information technology, renewable energy, mechanics, food production and naval engineering. Creative industries in Nantes had over 9,000 architectural, design, fashion, media, visual-arts and digital-technology companies in 2016, a 15-percent job-creation rate between 2007 and 2012 and have a hub under construction on the Isle of Nantes.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nNantes' cityscape is primarily recent, with more buildings built during the 20th century than in any other era. The city has 122 buildings listed as monuments historiques, the 19th-ranked French city. Most of the old buildings were made of tuffeau stone (a light, easily sculpted sandstone typical of the Loire Valley) and cheaper schist. Because of its sturdiness, granite was often used for foundations. Old buildings on the former Feydeau Island and the neighbouring embankments often lean because they were built on damp soil.Nantes has a few structures dating to antiquity and the early Middle Ages. Remnants of the third-century Roman city wall exist in the old town. The Saint-\u00c9tienne chapel, in the Saint-Donatien cemetery outside  the city centre, dates to 510 and was originally part of a Roman necropolis. The Roman city walls were largely replaced during the 13th and 15th centuries. Although many of the walls were destroyed in the 18th century, some segments (such as Porte Saint-Pierre, built in 1478) survived.\n\nSeveral 15th- and 16th-century half-timbered houses still stand in Le Bouffay, an ancient area corresponding to Nantes' medieval core which is bordered by Nantes Cathedral and the Castle of the Dukes of Brittany. The large, Gothic cathedral replaced an earlier Romanesque church. Its construction took 457 years, from 1434 to 1891. The cathedral's tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and his wife is an example of French Renaissance sculpture. The Psallette, built next to the cathedral about 1500, is a late-Gothic mansion. The Gothic castle is one of Nantes' chief landmarks. Begun in 1207, many of its current buildings date to the 15th century. Although the castle had a military role, it was also a residence for the ducal court. Granite towers on the outside hide delicate tuffeau-stone ornaments on its inner facades, designed in Flamboyant style with Italianate influence. The Counter-Reformation inspired two baroque churches: the 1655 Oratory Chapel and Sainte-Croix Church, rebuilt in 1670. A municipal belfry clock (originally on a tower of Bouffay Castle, a prison demolished after the French Revolution) was added to the church in 1860. \n\nAfter the Renaissance, Nantes developed west of its medieval core along new embankments. Trade-derived wealth permitted the construction of many public monuments during the 18th century, most designed by the neoclassical architects Jean-Baptiste Ceineray and Mathurin Crucy. They include the Chamber of Accounts of Brittany (now the pr\u00e9fecture, 1763\u20131783); the Graslin Theatre (1788); Place Foch, with its column and statue of Louis XVI (1790), and the stock exchange (1790\u20131815). Place Royale was completed in 1790, and the large fountain added in 1865. Its statues represent the city of Nantes, the Loire and its main tributaries. The city's 18th-century heritage is also reflected in the h\u00f4tels particuliers and other private buildings for the wealthy, such as the Cours Cambronne (inspired by Georgian terraces). Although many of the 18th-century buildings have a neoclassical design, they are adorned with sculpted rococo faces and balconies. This architecture has been called \"Nantais baroque\".\n\nMost of Nantes' churches were rebuilt during the 19th century, a period of population growth and religious revival after the French Revolution. Most were rebuilt in Gothic Revival style, including the city's two basilicas: Saint-Nicolas and Saint-Donatien. The first, built between 1844 and 1869, was one of France's first Gothic Revival projects. The latter was built between 1881 and 1901, after the Franco-Prussian War (which triggered another Catholic revival in France). Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port, near the Loire, is an example of 19th-century neoclassicism. Built in 1852, its dome was inspired by that of Les Invalides in Paris. The Passage Pommeraye, built in 1840\u20131843, is a multi-storey shopping arcade typical of the mid-19th century.Industrial architecture includes several factories converted into leisure and business space, primarily on the Isle of Nantes. The former Lef\u00e8vre-Utile factory is known for its Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nNantes has several museums. The Fine Art Museum is the city's largest. Opened in 1900, it has an extensive collection ranging from Italian Renaissance paintings to contemporary sculpture. The museum includes works by Tintoretto, Brueghel, Rubens, Georges de La Tour, Ingres, Monet, Picasso, Kandinsky and Anish Kapoor. The Historical Museum of Nantes, in the castle, is dedicated to local history and houses the municipal collections. Items include paintings, sculptures, photographs, maps and furniture displayed to illustrate major points of Nantes history such as the Atlantic slave trade, industrialisation and the Second World War.The Dobr\u00e9e Museum, closed for repairs as of 2017, houses the d\u00e9partement's archaeological and decorative-arts collections. The building is a Romanesque Revival mansion facing a 15th-century manor. Collections include a golden reliquary made for Anne of Brittany's heart, medieval statues and timber frames, coins, weapons, jewellery, manuscripts and archaeological finds. The Natural History Museum of Nantes is one of the largest of its kind in France. It has more than 1.6 million zoological specimens and several thousand mineral samples. The Machines of the Isle of Nantes, opened in 2007 in the converted shipyards, has automatons, prototypes inspired by deep-sea creatures and a  12-metre-tall (39 ft), walking elephant. With 620,000 visitors in 2015, the Machines were the most-visited non-free site in Loire-Atlantique. Smaller museums include the Jules Verne Museum (dedicated to the author, who was born in Nantes) and the Planetarium. The HAB Galerie, located in a former banana warehouse on the Loire, is Nantes' largest art gallery. Owned by the city council, it is used for contemporary-art exhibitions. The council manages four other exhibition spaces, and the city has several private galleries.\n\n\n=== Venues ===\n\nLe Z\u00e9nith Nantes M\u00e9tropole, an indoor arena in Saint-Herblain, has a capacity of 9,000 and is France's largest concert venue outside Paris. Since its opening in 2006, Placebo, Supertramp, Snoop Dogg and Bob Dylan have performed on its stage. Nantes' largest venue is La Cit\u00e9, Nantes Events Center, a 2,000-seat auditorium. It hosts concerts, congresses and exhibitions, and is the primary venue of the Pays de la Loire National Orchestra. The Graslin Theatre, built in 1788, is home to the Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra. The former LU biscuit factory, facing the castle, has been converted into Le Lieu unique. It includes a Turkish bath, restaurant and bookshop and hosts art exhibits, drama, music and dance performances. The 879-seat Grand T is the Loire-Atlantique d\u00e9partement theatre, and the Salle Vasse is managed by the city. Other theatres include the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre universitaire and several private venues. La Fabrique, a cultural entity managed by the city, has three sites which include music studios and concert venues. The largest is Stereolux, specialising in rock concerts, experimental happenings and other contemporary performances. The 140-seat Pannonica specialises in jazz, and the nearby 503-seat Salle Paul-Fort is dedicated to contemporary French singers. Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n\n=== Events and festivals ===\n\nThe Royal de Luxe street theatre company moved to Nantes in 1989, and has produced a number of shows in the city. The company is noted for its large marionettes (including a giraffe, the Little Giant and the Sultan's Elephant), and has also performed in Lisbon, Berlin, London and Santiago. Former Royal de Luxe machine designer Fran\u00e7ois Delarozi\u00e8re created the Machines of the Isle of Nantes and its large walking elephant in 2007. The Machines sponsor theatre, dance, concerts, ice-sculpting shows and performances for children in the spring and fall and at Christmastime.Estuaire contemporary-art exhibitions were held along the Loire estuary in 2007, 2009 and 2012. They left several permanent works of art in Nantes and inspired the Voyage \u00e0 Nantes, a series of contemporary-art exhibitions across the city which has been held every summer since 2012. A route (a green line painted on the pavement) helps visitors make the voyage between the exhibitions and the city's major landmarks. Some works of art are permanent, and others are used for a summer. Permanent sculptures include Daniel Buren's Anneaux (a series of 18 rings along the Loire reminiscent of Atlantic slave trade shackles) and works by Fran\u00e7ois Morellet and Dan Graham.La Folle Journ\u00e9e (The Mad Day, an alternate title of Pierre Beaumarchais' play The Marriage of Figaro) is a classical music festival held each winter. The original one-day festival now lasts for five days. Its programme has a main theme (past themes have included exile, nature, Russia and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin), mixing classics with lesser-known and -performed works. The concept has been exported to Bilbao, Tokyo and Warsaw, and the festival sold a record 154,000 tickets in 2015. The September Rendez-vous de l'Erdre couples a jazz festival with a pleasure-boating show on the Erdre, exposing the public to a musical genre considered elitist; all concerts are free. Annual attendance is about 150,000. The Three Continents Festival is an annual film festival dedicated to Asia, Africa and South America, with a Mongolfi\u00e8re d'or (Golden Hot-air Balloon) awarded to the best film. Nantes also hosts Univercin\u00e9 (festivals dedicated to films in English, Italian, Russian and German) and a smaller Spanish film festival. The Scopitone festival is dedicated to digital art, and Utopiales is an international science fiction festival.\n\n\n=== Slavery Memorial ===\nA path along the Loire river banks, between the Anne-de-Bretagne Bridge and the Victor-Schoelcher footbridge begins the Nantes slavery memorial. The path is covered in 2,000 spaced glass inserts, with 1,710 of them commemorating the names of slave ships and their port dates in Nantes. The other 290 inserts name ports in Africa, the Americas, and the area around the Indian Ocean. The path and surrounding 1.73-acre park lead to the under-the-docks part of the memorial which opens with a staircase, leading visitors underground closer to the water level of the river, which can be seen through the gaps between the support pillars. Upon entry, visitors are greeted with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the word \u201cfreedom\u201d written in 47 different languages from areas affected by the slave trade. Other etchings of quotes by figures like Nelson Mandela and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. appear on the slanted frosted glass wall which lined the memorial wall opposite the pillars which open to the river. These quotes come from across the globe, from all four continents affected by the slave trade, and span over five centuries, from the 17th to the 21st.  At the end of the hall, toward the exit, is a room with the timeline of slavery as it became abolished in various countries around the world.\n\n\n=== In the arts ===\n\nNantes has been described as the birthplace of surrealism, since Andr\u00e9 Breton (leader of the movement) met Jacques Vach\u00e9 there in 1916. In Nadja (1928), Andr\u00e9 Breton called Nantes \"perhaps with Paris the only city in France where I have the impression that something worthwhile may happen to me\". Fellow surrealist Julien Gracq wrote The Shape of a City, published in 1985, about the city. Nantes also inspired Stendhal (in his 1838 M\u00e9moires d'un touriste); Gustave Flaubert (in his 1881 Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves, where he describes his journey through Brittany); Henry James, in his 1884 A Little Tour in France; Andr\u00e9 Pieyre de Mandiargues in Le Mus\u00e9e noir (1946), and Paul-Louis Rossi in Nantes (1987).The city is the hometown of French New Wave film director Jacques Demy. Two of Demy's films were set and shot in Nantes: Lola (1964) and A Room in Town (1982). The Passage Pommeraye appears briefly in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Other films set (or filmed) in Nantes include God's Thunder by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re (1965), The Married Couple of the Year Two by Jean-Paul Rappeneau (1971), Day Off by Pascal Thomas (2001) and Black Venus by Abdellatif Kechiche (2010). Jean-Luc Godard's Keep Your Right Up was filmed at its airport in 1987.Nantes appears in a number of songs, the best-known to non-French audiences being 2007's \"Nantes\" by the American band Beirut. French-language songs include \"Nantes\" by Barbara (1964) and \"Nantes\" by Renan Luce (2009). The city is mentioned in about 50 folk songs, making it the most-sung-about city in France after Paris. \"Dans les prisons de Nantes\" is the most popular, with versions recorded by \u00c9dith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Tri Yann and Nolwenn Leroy. Other popular folk songs include \"Le pont de Nantes\" (recorded by Guy B\u00e9art in 1967 and Nana Mouskouri in 1978), \"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Nantes\" (a sea shanty) and the bawdy \"De Nantes \u00e0 Montaigu\".British painter J. M. W. Turner visited Nantes in 1826 as part of a journey in the Loire Valley, and later painted a watercolour view of Nantes from Feydeau Island. The painting was bought by the city in 1994, and is on exhibit at the Historical Museum in the castle. Turner also made two sketches of the city, which are in collections at Tate Britain.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the 19th century Nantes-born gastronome Charles Monselet praised the \"special character\" of the local \"plebeian\" cuisine, which included buckwheat crepes, caillebotte fermented milk and fouace brioche. The Nantes region is renowned in France for market gardens and is a major producer of corn salad, leeks, radishes and carrots. Nantes has a wine-growing region, the Vignoble nantais, primarily south of the Loire. It is the largest producer of dry white wines in France, chiefly Muscadet and Gros Plant (usually served with fish, langoustines and oysters).Local fishing ports such as La Turballe and Le Croisic mainly offer shrimp and sardines, and eels, lampreys, zander and northern pike are caught in the Loire. Local vegetables and fish are widely available in the city's eighteen markets, including the Talensac covered market (Nantes' largest and best-known). Although local restaurants tend to serve simple dishes made with fresh local products, exotic trends have influenced many chefs in recent years.Beurre blanc is Nantes' most-famous local specialty. Made with Muscadet, it was invented around 1900 in Saint-Julien-de-Concelles (on the south bank of the Loire) and has become a popular accompaniment for fish. Other specialties are the LU and BN biscuits, including the Petit-Beurre (produced since 1886), berlingot (sweets made with flavoured melted sugar) and similar rigolette sweets with marmalade filling, g\u00e2teau nantais (a rum cake invented in 1820), Cur\u00e9 nantais and M\u00e2checoulais cheeses and fouace, a star-shaped brioche served with new wine in autumn.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe University of Nantes was first founded in 1460 by Francis II, Duke of Brittany, but it failed to become a large institution during the Ancien R\u00e9gime. It disappeared in 1793 with the abolition of French universities. During the 19th century, when many of the former universities reopened, Nantes was neglected and local students had to go to Rennes and Angers. In 1961 the university was finally recreated, but Nantes has not established itself as a large university city. The university had about 30,000 students during the 2013\u20132014 academic year, and the metropolitan area had a total student population of 53,000.

Nantes is on the Way of the Estuaries, a network of motorways connecting northern France and the Spanish border in the south-west while bypassing Paris. The network serves Rouen, Le Havre, Rennes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. South of Nantes, the road corresponds to the A83 motorway; north of the city (towards Rennes) it is the RN137, a free highway. These motorways form a 43-kilometre (27 mi) ring road around the city, France's second-longest after the ring in Bordeaux.Nantes' central railway station is connected by TGV trains to Paris, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. The LGV Atlantique high-speed railway reaches Paris in two hours, ten minutes (compared with four hours by car). With almost 12 million passengers each year, the Nantes station is the sixth-busiest in France outside Paris. In addition to TGV trains, the city is connected by Intercit\u00e9s trains to Rennes, Vannes, Quimper, Tours, Orl\u00e9ans, La Rochelle and Bordeaux. Local TER trains serve Pornic, Cholet or Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.\n\nNantes Atlantique Airport in Bouguenais, 8 kilometres (5.0 miles) south-east of the city centre, serves about 80 destinations in Europe (primarily in France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Greece) and connects airports in Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Air traffic has increased from 2.6 million passengers in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2014, while its capacity has been estimated at 3.5 million passengers per year. A new A\u00e9roport du Grand Ouest in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, 20 kilometres (12 miles) north of Nantes, was projected from the 1970s, to create a hub serving north-western France. Its construction was however strongly opposed, primarily by green and anti-capitalist activists. The potential construction site was long occupied and the project became a political topic on the national scale. The French government eventually decided to renounce to the project in 2018.Public transport in Nantes is managed by Semitan, also known as \"Tan\". One of the world's first horsebus transit systems was developed in the city in 1826. Nantes built its first compressed-air tram network in 1879, which was electrified in 1911. Like most European tram networks, Nantes' disappeared during the 1950s in the wake of automobiles and buses. However, in 1985 Nantes was the first city in France to reintroduce trams. The city has an extensive public-transport network consisting of trams, buses and river shuttles. The Nantes tramway has three lines and a total of 43.5 kilometres (27.0 miles) of track. Semitan counted 132.6 million trips in 2015, of which 72.3 million were by tram. Navibus, the river shuttle, has two lines: one on the Erdre and the other on the Loire. The latter has 520,000 passengers annually and succeeds the Roquio service, which operated on the Loire from 1887 to the 1970s.Nantes has also developed a tram-train system, the Nantes tram-train, which would allow suburban trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two tram-train lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Ch\u00e2teaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains.

Construction started at the end of 1840 and was completed on 4 July 1843.\nThe Passage Pommeraye is a passage between two streets, the rue Santeuil and rue de la Fosse, with one 9.40 m higher than the other. Midway, there is a flight of steps and the mall then continues on another floor. Two architects, Jean-Baptiste Buron and Hippolyte Durand Gasselin, contributed to its design, which is very elaborate and includes renaissance style sculptures.\nThe Passage Pommeraye has been classified as a historic monument since 1976.\n\n\n== Movies ==\nThe Passage Pommeraye can be seen in several movies : \n\nLola by director Jacques Demy.\nUne chambre en ville by director Jacques Demy.\nLes Parapluies de Cherbourg by director Jacques Demy.\nLa reine blanche by director Jean-Loup Huber.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nhttps://archive.today/20120910110520/http://www.nantes44.com/pommeray.htm (in French), accessed on 10 November 2005\n\n\n== Photos ==",

          "The form , shape and composition of this building is absolutely worth a visit just to marvel at the arrangement and design of the building and shops that make up this small shopping mall between two streets..It is classified as a historic monument in 1976",
          "Visited on a Sunday so almost everything was closed. The interior architecture is nice and worth a brief visit",
          "Beautiful passage in the center on Nantes. I felt that I transferred in old France. The passage shops are expensive, but it is not a main point.",
          "This masterpiece of a classic, closed urban shopping mall from the late 19th Century has been kept up well. Shops also continue to offer quality wares. A photo op as well as walk back into history.",
          "In the middle of town there is this beahtiful arcade building, very stylish indeed. Enjoy the building, and some window shopping, because most of the shops there are way too expensive.",
          "A wonderful place to shop, or just to visit and view. Quaint shop fronts, beautiful staircases which bring you out at street level two floors up. Browse for a couple of hours as we did on a wet afternoon. If following the 'green line` which takes you round Nantes, it recomences",
          "We were given a map which showed a walk round the city and one of the area it took us through was the Passage de Pommeraye. Beautiful building with a really variety of small one off shops - a shopper's paradise! It was very busy and we didn't stop long but well worth a visit.",
          "It's worth going to Nantes just to see this place! Even if you don't like shopping! Magnificent place, 3 storeys of shops, amazing!",
          "The passage is very beautiful and clean. The shops inside sell very special things, including food and home decorations.",
          "This is a small shopping arcade that links 3 streets. It only has a few rather expensive shops but the decor has a lovely \u2018Paris in the good old days\u2019 feel to it. Definitely worth a visit. Warning: lots of stairs.",
          "A three story covered arcade from the 19th century with shops to match. Well worth a walk through even if you are not tempted to shop. Was amazed by the shop/temple devoted to the humble sardine and various other fish. The building has a glass roof which lets in the light .",
          "We stumbled on this shopping arcade whilst exploring the old town. We didn't do any shopping but loved the architecture and the statues. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lots of shops for the shop-a-colic but the most interesting part of the place is the vaulted glass ceiling and statue-lined walkways. It's like walking through history and a must for non-shoppers as well.",
          "The shopping in Nantes is great, plenty of little independent stores down cobbled streets as well as the more familiar high street stores. And then there's Passage Pommeraye, a three storey 19th century shopping arcade full of architectural splendour. The shops are a quite a",
          "if you come to Nantes, you have to cross through this place. You can visit the shops, but the most important thing is the building.",
          "On an afternoon excursion to Nantes with my aunt from the US and cousins who live near the city, we came across this beautiful building. At first, I thought it looked like some sort of train station but upon closer inspection, I realised that it was a shopping plaza. It was",
          "This was full of , for me, uninteresting shops and also being sunday very few were open. Needless to say we did not return when they were open.",
          "Nice place! Well maintained. Nice shops. Very clean place. We walked through a few times. Cosy place.",
          "A rare example of a beautifully preserved and still functioning belle epoque shopping mall. Unusual because it is built on three levels following the slope of a hill from top to bottom. Not to be missed if you're going up one of the main shopping streets from square to square.",
          "nice passage well decorated with Christmas decorations. A must see in Nantes. strongly recommend if you are around",
          "A really charming place to go and window shop or find something you didn\u2019t know you were looking for.",
          "An old shopping arcade with some ok shops inside. Nice architecture, but not somewhere that grabbed me in terms of shopping options. Worth a quick visit.",
          "It's a pleasant enough arcade with some quirky shops. Worth a look, while wandering the \"green line\" tourist walk. Saw a great shirt shop, cotton shirts with really unusual prints - think strawberries, flowers, dogs, etc. Fair prices for original designs.",
          "This is a very attractive historic shopping arcade on 3 levels with many stairs. It is situated in the centre of the city, about a 15/20 min walk from the Chateau.",
          "this is a lovely building with great architecture you can really feel the history here, it is a perfect slice of France. the shops are all nice and well suited to the arcade and it is worth having a walk through. this is just a shopping centre though so past that don't expect",
          "Passage Pommeraye is just an old fashion shopping path. For sure there are interesting shops but honestly I was a little surprise to find this location in Nantes top 3. In most of European city you can find similar commercial places. Considering that you can easily get to",
          "Worth passing through if on your way but not worth much of a detour. Three levels of nice shops and nice architecture",
          "Beautiful architecture, with the stairs and statues, the glass ceiling lets a cosy natural light through. Some interesting shops but expensive. Our favorite was Pylones for their fun stuff. It's worth to visit and take pictures. The whole family enjoyed the experience.",
          "The architecture on three levels is stunning, and the statues are fun, but it's a bit small and the prices of the poncy products are astronomic. BIG attraction - it's very close to the wonderful C&A!",
          "It depends on your point of view. If you want to look at something historical, that\u2019s pretty, then you\u2019ll love it like we did. However, if your looking for a huge modern Shopping Mall, then you\u2019ll be disappointed.",
          "First priority when in vacation aside from prominent landmarks and sightseeing there must be a huge and big shopping malls for my wife\u2019s favorite past time- shopping spree. This is a beautiful place of different brands of stores, clean and orderly.",
          "Beautiful architecture well worth viewing. Full of shops unlike some of the covered passages in Paris that were half empty.",
          "Architecturally a great place to visit, unlike similar arcades in London and Leeds it could benefit from really thinking about what it\u2019s doing because the shops were an eclectic mix from specialist shirt shops to outdoors equipment shops.",
          "It\u2019s hard to believe this was conceived and commissioned in the 19th Century. Stunning architectural masterpiece, wonderful marble and wrought iron. Home today to a variety of boutique luxury shops. Definitely worth strolling through.",
          "What a lovely 19th century covered shopping mall built, to suit the terrain, on three levels. The architecture is quite beautiful and there is an array of good, high end, retailers with well presented shop windows to browse.",
          "This is an impressive shopping arcade built especially for the more affluent folks of the 19 century. Today it is still high end shopping with some of the well known names. There are 3 levels to explore which means many steps. I did not see a lift there. It has beautifully",
          "Architecture and shopping I like discovering new shops and Hermes and the variety of businesses and the architecture. Photo op",
          "This is an amazing \"passage couvert\" with all the charm of XIXth Century French architecture. Make sure to visit it when going to Nantes. Famous for being the set of Jacques Demy's iconic movies Lola, Les Parapluies de Cherbourg and Une Chambre en Ville.",

          "Unusual Art Deco space dedicated to shops with difficult access for wheelchairs or anyone with limited mobility. Some of the shops were closed and for rent signs if your into architecture than worth a visit and take some photos.",

          "Loved this place. Architectural gem with beautiful atmosphere and perspectives. good shopping, nice traditional coffee shop, right in the center of Nantes. recommended",
          "Basically a large shopping mall, full of clothes, shoes and treats, the decoration is very interesting and grand, but not the most comfortable space in shopping rush hour and most spaces are quite tight with too many people.",
          "Only visited didn\u2019t shop seemed expensive. But lovely shops and has very elegant high end stores. Right in the middle of old town, no cars no taxis allowed so only way to get there is walking!",
          "On christmas time it has nice Christmas decoration. The passage is beautiful. Has nice stores and bakeries",
          "We stayed at Hotel Pommerade, so this was on our doorstep and we walked through it every day on our way around Nantes. Very high class and ornate - each day we found something new to goggle at, but our wallets and purses stayed firmly in our pockets!!!",
          "Beautiful architecture and some interesting boutiques in this multi-level arcade. The statuary and architecture are amazing.",
          "Special shopping center. Very old and luxury architecture. Interesting goods. However you havent money, good to see.",
          "Many individual shops including one with all things for travellers. Indiana Jones type of equipment available including edible worms.! Good photo opportunity. Young people were offering \"free hugs\" when we were there.",
          "It was built in the 19th century, so it's an experience in the past while shopping! It's so typical French and a taste of Paris in Nantes!!!",
          "It is one of the things you need to do when visiting Nantes, one of the surprises this City kept quiet about. It's very attractive for the architecture and quaintness but what stores there were seemed to be 'top end' and very exclusive and at the end of the day not that many.",
          "Classy place and interesting architecture worth a detour. Also houses the smallest shop in Nantes: less than 10 square meters!",
          "A well preserved shopping centre with lovely feature decorations and a wide variety of shops. It's a good place to wonder through if walking about the town.",
          "The decor in this shopping centre is very opulent but it is nothing more than a covered shopping area. Not worth going out of your way to visit but nice to pass through.",
          "Beautiful arcade. It won't take you long to walk through it but it is beautiful to walk through. The shops in it are fairly expensive but offer good window shopping especially the patisserie at the bottom.",
          "The architecture is lovely, a really unusual and character filled building and a beautiful setting. I didn't shop here; just looked round and enjoyed the structure but as a shopping mall I didn't think much of it's wares. Expensive and aside of a shirt shop selling",
          "Nice building, it is worth a visit \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Shops are ok. There are better places for shopping in Nantes.",
          "Amazing architecture. Seems to have had more built on to it since last visit. Many shoe shops and some household shops. Interesting.",
          "The Passage Pommeraye was so full of tourists wet from the rain outside that I was distracted from admiring the architecture of this shopping mall. It probably would be better to visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon. There are many dress stores, a Creuset store",
          "Not as beautiful as in years gone by - a few empty shops which gives the impression its a bit down t heel. Could do with a lick of paint. Some very nice shops but the building itself is worth visiting.",
          "This place is nice decorated, it's pretty much all stores inside but it worth to visit at least quickly since it's very typical. It's nice to walk through it.",
          "We were passing by and saw a bit of a crowd so wondered what we were missing. Took a look and the building itself is very pretty, a lovely roof, statues, staircase. Pretty grand for a shopping precinct! Probably not something I'd go out my way to hunt out personally but if",
          "Don't get me wrong it is a very nice shopping arcade architecturally speaking but there's no getting away that it is an arcade filled with hyper expensive touristy shops selling chocolates etc... That no normal person would go to. Worth a visit yes but top 10 things to do in",
          "This is a most interesting shopping arcade which was constructed back in the 19th century. It is architecturally most impressive and houses an interesting variety of shops and a restaurant. This is certainly one of the key highlights in the centre of Nantes and not to be missed.",
          "Passage Pommeraye is a mind blowing shopping mal with many different shops. The old passage is also good for people who like architecture.",
          "Take the time and pass by. Worth it . Beautiful staircase and ceilings. And you can do a bit of shopping at the same time ladies \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Great place to visit!! Beautiful architecture, shops for everyone. Also cool place to take pictures. During Christmas they also put an amazing work.",
          "This is an interesting late 1800s mall. This is not somewhere that I would just come to see, unless I was in this town. We found it very enjoyable especially the architecture and sculptures on the stairways. Understanding, that this type of dwelling gave rise to all of the",
          "A pristine shopping mall. Elegantly designed with well integrated shops. Perfect for window shopping",
          "While spending summer in France and passing through Nantes we found this arcade off the street. We ducked it to check out some of the \"soldes\" and were pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful multi storied arcade offering high level boutique shops as well as a small assortment",
          "Enjoyable and pretty to the eye! Great place to wander and window shop! Excellent location to a vibrant area of shops and restaurants.",
          "I honestly thought it would be better given that it is is highly ranked on Tripadvisor. There are much much better examples of classic shopping centre the world. It's nice but there are better things to see in Nantes",
          "The arcade is a true gem produced by a notator of the early 19th century. Notaires are usually quite wealthy and this one loved Nantes. Lots of interesting small shops. Worth a detour.",
          "I was in Nantes and couldn\u2019t miss the Passage Promuyere. It is beautiful but nothing terrible. In my opinion they need other type of shops to match the old decoration of the passage.",
          "Wonderful choice of shops, especially those related to home wares. Friendly service in all the shops we went to. We loved it.",
          "Located just behind the place du commerce in the heart of nantes, this passage is a pure jewel. You either go up or down the stairs to admire the atmosphere, architecture and sculptures. Some shops on both sides with an incredible chocolate-maker/artist at the bottom that will",
          "Not a fan of shopping centres usually, but this one was very pretty. Worth a stroll through when visiting Nantes.",
          "A beautiful building. Shops carry what I would call luxury & different goods which adds to the place. A definite place to visit when on a trip to Nantes",
          "An unusual shopping centre, limited amount of shops as it is the oldest shopping mall in Europe, the decor stands out but then so do the crowds",
          "It is situated in the center of the city, it is very beautiful, now in December. We enjoyed a small walk here, most of the shops wereclosed due to holiday period.",
          "The architecture is lovely to see but difficult to appreciate when there are tons of people around you. Going early in the morning (i.e., before 10am) allows you to take in the design of the space. There are shops around but that was not my focal point. It's a short passage \u2014 it",
          "It's a very very nice place to go to if you have to time. There are shops downstairs and upstairs. I have 2 favorites which are Nature & D\u00e9couverte and the chocolate shop downstairs near the exit beside the Fnac. The architecture is great too.",
          "A beautiful walkway that connects 2 famous shopping streets of Nantes. Fully renovated \"as before\" 2 years ago. Magnificent !",
          "One of the highlights if our visit. Splendid passage on 2 floors full of delightful shops (I would particularly recommend Alice Delice if you are obsessed with cooking accessories like me. Heaven!).",
          "Visited Nantes on the way back from the south, we came across this as exploring the town and wow it's something different which I've never seen before and is really special I visited during the day time looks more stunning at night. The shops inside didn't really interest me but",

          "This modest-sized historic shopping arcade is well worth a visit even by a non-shopper such as me. It is flamboyant and a great reminder of a bygone age.",
          "A typical old, nice, bohemic, french \"passage\". The architecture is beautifull, it has been renovated last yaer I think. Some cute shops.",
          "The \"passage Pommeraye\" is one of oldest building of Nantes, really cool with lot of shops !!! localisation Near the city center",
          "If you're passing go in. Certainly don't make a special visit. It's just a selection of shops. Good it's under cover but not much more I can say.",
          "Passage Pommeraye is a pretty old building, recently reopened as a shopping arcade. Architecturally, it\u2019s nice to look at, but there are a lot of steps, so not for the unfit or faint-hearted. Shops are, pretty-much, the same as everywhere, though there\u2019s a good patisserie.",
          "If you come to Nantes you must go to the \"passage Pomereye\" there are a lot of stores like \"Hermes\" or \"Nature et decouverte\"",
          "Lovely little shops to have a wander round from the hustle of the squares and outside streets. is a very pretty building with some great photo opportunities.",
          "Stunning enviroment, but a shame there is no food available to spend more time. (At least we did not manage to find anything at 5pm.) I would not call this a mall, but rather a covered market.",
          "Lovely architecture but no different to any other shopping arcade when all is said and done. boutique style shops and good style but nothing out of the ordinary for me",
          "The architecture of this covered passageway is incredible' but the shops are the same you see all around. We were lucky, there was a book signing by several authors.",
          "A lovely feature with many interesting boutiques. However not cheap! A lot of stairs to climb to get to the top but worth it.",
          "Awesome place with some really good chocolate shops. Looks mesmerizing when decorated during Christmas.",
          "Very nice gallery with great, typical french products, such as sardines, chocolates,... I would advise everyone to go there for souvenir shopping.",
          "Arrived early just as the shops were opening up. Didn't do much shopping so much as get some pictures of the beautiful architecture of the structure.",
          "As the name suggests it is a passage to pass through! The architecture inside the passage is good and quite a few number of shops selling French delicacies. There are also shops for shoes, dress, jewelry etc. I also observed shops for philately and numismatics. If you are",
          "It's a beautiful arcade. Not as grand as Naples but stunning and it contains some lovely shops full of French chic especially the shoes!",
          "Yes a beautiful building, small, and the passage gives it some diversion but not many fancy stores or restaurants inside unfortunately so it is only a \"Passage\" to go through.",
          "Whether you're just passing through the Passage (as we were) or stopping to shop, it's a lovely place and worth a looksy.",
          "It is nice to walk through, and the architecture is interesting to see but it is not that beautiful... It is to see though if you are in nantes",
          "The shops are set in a lovely old building with lots of stairs and with shops on each level. It was nice to visit but I think there are butter places to spend your time while in Nantes.",

          "What a breath of fresh air this place is after the soul-less shopping malls all over the world. Beautiful building with many interesting shops. Statues everywhere. I didn't buy anything but that doesn't matter, I just enjoyed walking through the 19th century arcade, away from",
          "Many interesting boutiques in this historical passage. A feast for the eyes and a voyage into time past",
          "Got to be honest, I was expecting, and hoping for more. There is a large sign over the entrance which ensures you know you've arrived, but at the end of the day, it's a shopping arcade. A very pretty shopping arcade, but an arcade none the less.",
          "Nice architecture and mini figures. Building has 3 floors and has very expensive shops. Good to look at. Many people come here to take photos so it does get crowded. Tourist office near the chateau will give directions and a large town map. Top tip: get a 24 hour bus and tram",
          "Stunning. Beautifully re-done. Uber sophisticated shopping. Go back again and again. Well located near restaurant district.",
          "I love the Passage. It is pretty and ornate and lovely to stroll through, particularly at Christmas. This time I was there in spring. My only quibble is that the shops aren't really for me but it doesn't mean others won't appreciate them.",
          "Beauitful building and lovely shops! Amazing chocolate shop and mainly shoe and cloth shops. Quite expensive but very luxurious",
          "Simply beautiful place with lots of small shops, caffeteries and amazing hand made chocolate shop. The choise of macarons is the best in the Nantes for my opinion.",
          "Beautiful high-end arcade with hermes and la passag\u00e8re, a nice salon de th\u00e9 where you can have lunch. A must see if you're in town.",

          "A very nice trip in the history of Nantes, stairs and buildings of the 19th century, many interesting shopping places ( good pastries and candies at the entrance near place du Commerce).",
          "We have visited several passages in other French cities but this one is unique because it is much lighter and brighter than most. It also has much to see as far as sculpture and the decorated ceilings. It is located in the historic Graslin Quarter and is a point of interest on",
          "Passage Pommeraye is a beautiful and elegant 19th century shopping centre with a nice hall. It's really worth having a walk in there, even if you don't visit the shops, as its still used as a shopping centre.",
          "its an historic mall. very nice architecture, that invite to explore this space.some shops are average, but some others are really fun to visit and offers a variety of uncommon objects and products",

          "This shopping arcade is probably the nicest one I have visited. Its architecture is beautiful and very smart, rising for two floors and ending at the street level. It is a very lively place, with nice and interesting shops, but don\u2019t miss some fine craftsmen\u2019s details in the",
          "A cleverly constructed shopping arcade that rises two floors from its entrance to end up in the pedestrian tone. Well worth seeing, but don't bother to shop there.",
          "This beautiful structure had a number of spaces being renovated for new stores when I was there in June, but it was still fun to visit, and finding it led us to a very nice shopping area in town. Definitely worth finding your way to such an interesting building.",
          "Following the city tour led us through this beautiful arcade. It truly is a wonder with numerous boutiques throughout.",
          "I had read about this and just happened to bump into it by accident after going to a nearby cinema. Looks like it has been renovated. It was really beautiful. On July 14,Bastille day, there were even a few stores open. It looks like there are still a number of vacant stores.",

          "You could almost miss the passage Pommeraye if your not looking for it. Lots of nice quirky shops to look around as you walk up the very old marbled/stone stair case. You sense it's age by the way the stairs are naturally worn away by the thousands of foot steps that have walked",
          "I have to say I didnt expect much of this hotel before we arrived. So surprised! The location is superb in the middle off shopping , near the tram and cafes and restaurants. The hotel is quirky , clean and comfortable. The staff are super the breakfast fresh not plastic. ANd",
          "I am sure this small shopping arcade across several floor was once a jewel but today it bears no resemblance to pictures in my guide book about Nantes. The stunning gilded ceilings in photographs are now a dull cream. Shops are independent but none contained special or luxury",
          "I visited on April 12 and it was under a big construction...",
          "Small shopping arcade, small shops and boutiques, but nothing that exciting in a nice area near Place Royal and it's lovely fountain, closed on Sundays.",
          "Great arquitecture, it is definitely worth a stop by if you are in Nantes. Not so much for shopping, although there are some interesting places in the gallery itself. Many shops nearby, walking distance from the chateau",
          "Hermes is there. Also, a lovely shop where you can buy macarons a the bottom of the passage, on the left. There are appartments upstairs, so take note!",
          "This shopping mall is one expensive place to shop...prices to shock! The building itself is awesome,well worth a look and some photos, lotsa other shops & cafe/bars around,some \"bargains\" if you want to have a real good look. Nice stroll round this area though,and never any",
          "This Passage is well worth a visit, with beautifulshops and stunning archiecture. You could spend alot of time in here, taking in the eclectic mix of shops and products for sale. There are chocolate shops, clothes shops and gift shops to name but a few.Lovely experience.",

          "Having read some reviews on TripAdvisor before arriving in Nantes, I figured there wasn't a lot I'd be missing if I walked past it. Which is why I'm glad my partner dragged me in, because the architecture alone was worth a look. The shops in there are eclectic; aside from",
          "You just have to visit this little 'arcade' for a piece of nostalgia with a bit of quirkiness thrown in. The passage is beautiful with gleaming, well worn wooden stairs and wonderful shop fronts (take time to look closely at them) and shops catering for most people. Well worth",
          "Perhaps I had too high of expectations but this attraction just didn't do much for me. It is pretty inside but I did not find the shops or the overall feeling of the place that interesting. Felt rather cold and boring. If you come across it then walk thru... I wouldn't make a",

        "wiki": "The Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine is a former castle, now a ch\u00e2teau, in the Loire Valley located near Nantes, France. This castle has been home to the family of the marquis de Goulaine for over a thousand years. Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine is also the estate-bottled wine produced at the ch\u00e2teau.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 12th century, when the Duchy of Brittany was independent, the first Goulaine, Jean de Goulaine, then captain of the city of Nantes, fortified the estate, which is still surrounded by marshes, to defend against attacks from Normans. The Goulaine were of the old nobility, recorded in the  Seventh Crusade (1248). During the Wars of Religion, the Goulaine fought for the Catholic League: Gabriel, sieur de Goulaine, at the head of fifty lancers, and his brother Jean, baron du Faou\u00ebt, took the ch\u00e2teaux of Trogoff (Plouescat) and of K\u00e9rouz\u00e9r\u00e9 (Sibiril) in 1590. Gabriel was attached to the Bourbon cause in being made a marquis by Henry IV of France. The Goulaine family ownership of the estate continued uninterrupted until 1788 when it was sold to a Dutch banker. This circumstance helped save the ch\u00e2teau from destruction during the French Revolution. In 1858, a member of the Goulaine family reacquired the estate and maintains it today.\n\n\n== Wines ==\nWhile it is not clear exactly when the estate vineyard started producing wine for commercial use, rather than just family consumption, the millennium during which the estate of Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine has been producing wine makes it the oldest known wine business still in existence; It is believed to be the third oldest commercial enterprise in the world. It is considered the oldest European family owned business. The castle estate is one of the last Ch\u00e2teaux de la Loire to still be producing wine.In addition to producing a Muscadet, Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine also produces a Sancerre and Vouvray as well as what is believed to be the first commercial Chardonnay in the western Loire Valley. The estate also grows some Folle blanche.\n\n\n== Architecture of the ch\u00e2teau ==\nToday the style of the ch\u00e2teau, under its high pitched slate roofs bears some comparison to the central Loire estates of Ch\u00e2teau de Blois and Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, though Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine was built much earlier and in a more conservative style.\n\n\n== The butterflies aviary ==\nSince 1984, hundreds of tropical butterflies are showcased in an aviary, flying freely among tropical plants. This project was initiated by Marquis Robert de Goulaine (1933-2010) himself.\n\n\n== LU's Museum ==\nIn the older stables, you can visit the LU Museum. You can see the art and advertising collection of the brand of biscuits. There are 500 works of art (paintings, sculptures). The brand is very important in Nantes because the production of \"le Petit Beurre\" biscuits was in the \"quai Baco\" in the factories of the family. Today, the brand history is told with their works of art.\n\n\n== Beurre blanc ==\nAccording to one telling of the story, as favored by the American chef Bobby Flay, the white sauce beurre blanc was allegedly invented in the kitchen of Ch\u00e2teau de Goulaine by the head cook, Madame Cl\u00e9mence Lefeuvre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of oldest companies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Yes, it was much more than tourism. In fact it wasn't tourism at all. It beguns as a visit to the first of 4 chateaux foreseen for the afternoon. Luckily, it became the only one! Are you confuse? I explain. The castle was closed that day but, as good tourists, me and my partner",

          "Not much of this small to medium chateau was available to see and what there was, was fairly interesting. The LU biscuit museum was worth a visit for the artwork on display but the gardens and large empty courtyard and buildings were disappointing.",

          "Very disappointing, after driving a long way the ch\u00e2teau wasn't even open despite supposedly opening at 2pm was still closed at 2:45. Call before you go to avoid disappointment.",
          "We rented bicycles from Nantes and rode the ~1 hour out of town (Rent from Metropole a velo rather than the Bicloo because it will be cheaper in the long run). The ride was extremely flat and easy as well as beautiful as it meandered through the French countryside, especially",

          "We didn't go in as we were late arriving and the place was closed. However we did walk the grounds and took some photos, we also had a game of frisbee with the kids. Look closely at the most, it is full of wildlife, the otters are not shy either! Worth a visit.",
          "We had a guided tour with a badly speaking English guide who was had to understand. The tour only visited four rooms in this large Chateau. The tour ended with a boring visit to a biscuit museum. The only saving grace was a small taste of their wine and biscuits.",
          "Interesting guided tour (in French) with an enthusiastic guide. the butterfly place is fantastic and the LU museum an essential part of Nantes history. The ch\u00e2teau looks fantastic and there are nice walks around it. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon spent with family.",

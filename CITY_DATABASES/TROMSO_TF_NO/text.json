        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

          "There are several aquariums with artic plants, fish and shellfish. At certain times a day (10h00, 12h30 and 15h30) Seal feeding and training will take place. Price: 175 NOK/pax Opening hours: 11h00\u201418h00 (December)",
          "Nice place to spend an hour, checking out the seals, strange fish and urchins etc. Also a really nice interesting film giving a little insight into the aurora borealis.",
          "We have spent there few beautiful moments and we have learned a lot. Very nice, friendly and communicative staff. We really enjoyed our stay there. I can just recommend this to everyone.",
          "A good place to spend a couple of hours when you arrive in Tromso. It\u2019s not cheap to get in, but then nothing in Tromso is exactly cheap....There are some interesting exhibits about the area, plus an aquarium with walk-through tunnel, a panoramic cinema with 15 min films about",
          "I left my heart there. The seals are so cute and playful. I just loved the show and did not want to leave. The two cutest thing they did were (1) Kissing the trainer for a small piece of meat and (2) Rolling on the ice and sliding in the water. I felt like hugging them. They",
          "Great place to spend time if uou don\u2019t have any more plans. The aquarium is quite interesting and nice definitely worth seeing the seals. The price..nothing special for this region. The coffee shop was opened between 11-16.",
          "Amazing building . Quite expensive for what was there. Start with a film on the area . Then aquarium then watch seal feeding , coffee , shop and out. Seal feeding very busy . Get there early if you want to see it . Aquarium interesting but not huge - again felt cramped at times",
          "This is a very small aquarium, some very interesting animals and two film screenings. Lots of informative information around the place. A good way to spend a few hours.",
          "A fantastic museum and aquarium which gives a special insight into the natural history of the region. As an australian, all the wildlife here is so different so I was especially wrapt! The displays were well thought out and engaging - two film screenings, an inspiring section on",
          "I felt like it could use an update. The kids play area was bare bones and both my with and daughter hurt themselves on the slide. The gift shop was great and the aquarium was decent. The seals were fun, but about what you\u2019d see at feeding time at just about any zoo or",
          "Small but very interesting. The seal pool is fun but the other pools are also quite good and you can get close to the animals. Decent food in the cafeteria.",
          "This building is beautiful! Like tipped dominos. The aquarium is small and cozy. Love the cute and smart sea lions there! You can see the feeding time daily.",
          "We were expecting a much bigger exhibition so were a bit disappointed. The highlight of the place is four seals in a relatively small pool. We were lucky enough to arrive at feeding time so the staff gave some information about the animals and were happy to answer questions.",
          "It was a very wet day and it seemed like a good idea to visit this. It was rubbish. Could t see the seals I. The seal show, not much else to see. And super expensive for a 10 minute visit.",
          "Really disappointed. Super building with unusual architecture, but the displays inside look very tired and grubby. \u00a335 for two adults to go into the aquarium. Seal show was so busy that most people could not see what was going on. Pool looked dirty. Also very little to",
          "Overall a nice experience. The highlight is the aquarium where there are some seals. Twice or trice a day it is possibile to see the selas to be feeded.",
          "A great documentary of the northern lights and wildlife. The feeding section was cool! No too much to see of under the sea species.",
          "There is no reason to spend time here. Better go to the other places while in Troms\u00f8. I was expecting something special being in the polar region and after having seen the modern external architecture. The level is instructive for a school class trip, but apart from some seals",
          "Disappointing to say the least, hardly anything in there apart from the seals, I'd read about the seal show but wasn't impressed, even the kids were getting bored, in and out in 45 minutes.",
          "Went here on my last afternoon in Troms\u00f8 but found it really disappointing. The big attraction is the seal feeding, but there were so many people fighting for a vantage point that it\u2019s impossible to see what\u2019s happening and I saw very little. No, wouldn\u2019t recommend this one.",
          "I was fascinated by the building, and went for a look. Superb gift shop, and the exhibition was good. The seal feeding and training was a hilight.",
          "I was lucky to visit the place in time to see the feeding of the seals. What a show! Other exhibits also caught my attention...not to mention the eye-catching architecture of the building. he museum has a proper gift shop and a cafe as well.",
          "We went in at around 14:30, went around the quite small exhibitions and then was the time for seal feeding & training. They have this seal session 3 times a day and you should definitely only go during these times. The seals are a great experience for people of all ages! I got",
          "Living creatures, videos and plenty of information in a quiet, well designed place to know about arctic nature.",
          "Entrance ticket price is not reasonable for the no of activities in the venue. So reduce the entry ticket price r increase the activities offer.",
          "Seniors can visit here for 105K. Films showing were the Northern Lights and after the Svalbard Island wildlife. Both fascinating films and well photgraphed. Good commentary in English. At 12:30, feeding and training the seals, harbour and bearded. Also an aquarium and many",
          "We visited the aquarium as we had an afternoon to fill. For Tromso prices it was reasonable so we gave it a try. It's nicely laid out with the different exhibitions in different rooms. The touch tank was great we were lucky enough to have a member of staff talk us through",
          "I visited Polaria in Tromso on 6th Feb 2020. The highlight is surely the 4 bearded seals. The feeding and training session of the seal that happens 2 or 3 times in a day pulls in major crowds. Its surely worth a watch. Other than that, there is a good collection of starfish on",
          "Has interesting information about the Arctic and the film shows in the main Theatre are really good. All in all worth a visit",
          "Well worth a visit here, even if it\u2019s just for the seals! Great small museum, lots of information and the short films are also very informative. The seal feeding is great, check for the times as well worth\u2019s watch.",
          "Polaria is a neat aquarium with tons of great information about the northern lights, arctic circle, and marine life in the area. They also have a lot of interesting info on climate change and the environment. Make sure to attend one of the seal feeding and training shows!",
          "Ignore all the negative reviews and come visit the northern most aquarium in the world. At less then $20 USD it\u2019s cheaper then most aquariums I\u2019ve visited. Yes it is a little small but there is plenty to look at. We liked the the aquariums showing different fish and corals",
          "Did this as our final stop on a tour of Tromso. The film presentation was worth seeing and very interesting. Seal display and feeding fun to watch, although I would have liked a bit more info regarding the seals, I suppose I am not a fan of captive animals and I would have",
          "Nice place and the staffs were great! But i was expecting more information and more interactive stuff",
          "A small aquarium but very well done. A good way to pass an hour - was quite when we visited so could stroll around. Nice seal display. Nice cinematic area. No staff around aquarium touch pools to guide or educate",
          "It was my first time in Tromso, very good town, you can walk to every place and off course Polaria is a must that you have to visit, they explain the life of the seals, they have 3 different films and a local cafeteria inside on the second floor.",
          "Very nice museum. They show a film explaining the origin of the northern lights. If you're there at 12.30 pm, you watch the feeding of the seals with a little show. The gift shop is very good too.",
          "Waste of time and money cant really add more to fill minimum wird count. Save your money do something else. Obviously my opinion. Regards",
          "A nice place to visit during the holidays. Very cool route through the building, you can walk underneath the seals and there are a lot of other aquariums that are very nice to see. Also there is a lot of interesting information about the north pole and sustainability. And a very",
          "Extremely interesting and good value for money. The staff were so polite and the seals are true entertainers! Highly recommend",
          "Great aquarium, loved the seals, movies offered were very interesting also, a must see. Make sure you catch a seal feeding and training session.",
          "This is a wonderful centre full of information about the geography and experience of living in the polar regions. My daughters were fascinated with the information on offer and we stayed for a full afternoon educating ourselves. Another must visit if in Tromso.",
          "This attraction was small but perfect for our family with children aged 7 & 9. The information was educational and interesting, the widescreen movies were enjoyable, and the children always enjoy an indoor playground!",
          "Interesting videos projected talking about the northern lights and Svalbard. Few areas showing different maritime creatures. Seal feeding at the end which was @1230pm and lasted 15mins",
          "Really regret going here - the films weren't that great and some tanks were still being built. The gift shop is soooo funny - \u00a365 for a wooden mug! Entry is hugely overpriced and we didn't stay to see the seals being fed as there wasn't enough to keep us interested for more than",
          "During our visit we had a day where all the tours were cancelled because of the stormy weather so we searched for an alternative together with our teenager and thought of the Polaria as an alternative. Said and done. Yes it is not that big campared to other locations but we",
          "We loved our visit to the Polaria. It\u2019s a mix of museum, audio and aquarium. Provides great context regarding the northern Norway and polar environment and wildlife. Beautiful informative film on wide screen. And we saw marine animals we haven\u2019t seen before.",
          "My favorite in Troms\u00f8. It is walking distance from any part of the island. While crossing the bridge on walk, ensure to be covered properly. It might be very windy at the top of the bridge",
          "This small aquarium houses a small group of aquatic wildlife. When I visited in winter, it was a good spot to enjoy looking at the animals while keeping out of the cold. Paid parking is available right outside.",
          "The Polaria is not such a big aquarium, but I still love the experience Inhad there because they have dedicated staffs to explain things to you. On my visit, their marine ecologist named Simeon showed his enthusiasm and passion in taking care of the seals, in protecting out",
          "Arriver at opening time on a very wet day, staff friendly and helpful. Plenty of space to leave costs. The panoramic films were very enjoyable. Small gallery about climate change, which was very informative and thought provoking. Saw the seals being fed and they seem happy",
          "We have been shown two short films which were quite interesting, even for our 3 yr old. The aquarium is nice, but you're through it pretty fast. The seal feeding was nice at first but becomes boring quickly as they don't give any explanation etc. All in all quite expensive for",
          "Some interesting info about the polar environment. If you're looking for fun I'd say that the seals are the main attraction, you can watch their feeding and training every day at 12:30.",
          "Was told this was worth seeing and had some spare time before travelling. Horrified at the enclosure for the seals. Was just about to walk out of the show but lucky it finished. Save your money, even in the bigger part of the museum it wasnt that informative. Dont know how",
          "Really horrible to watch. We where told these seals where rescued by a local, which is definitely not the case. They had been taken from their natural habitat to be put in this aquarium which we did not know before we went in. Like watching circus animals perform. Have to do",
          "The price is worth what you get to see. You'll spend 45 mins to an hour here. The seals are great to see and appear really happy. The northern lights show is good and there is lots of info on global warming and local wildlife. Good place for kids!",
          "Huge displays of polar expedition memorabilia and lots of interesting info in the english language cations throughout.",
          "Nice building and worth the \u201cexplore\u201d over the bridge for the views. Keep hold of you KOR50 ticket as you can visit multiple times.",
          "This is a small aquarium with bearded seals which are amusing to watch. There are also tanks of other sea creatures, some of which can be touched by children. Whilst there we saw a film about the artic landscape which was lovely. A very pleasant trip!",
          "It's a beautifull church, nothing else. Beautufull arquiteture, beautifull view of the city and it's bridge",
          "Visited on a rainy afternoon. Aquarium although small was interesting and films about Svalbard and Northern lights was worth seeing. Would recommend if you have a few hours to spare.",
          "A good visit for a few hours. Two short films on the Northern lights and the wild life. Our 9 year old daughter liked the seal feeding. A pretty cool building also",
          "Polaria is a nice museum, but the exhibits are not as exciting as one might expect. On the other hand, the movies they show in their panoramic theatre about northern lights, parts of the arctic etc are just great to watch",
          "Please visit Polaria if you want to have an idea what's going on with climate change in this part of the world. A very nice place to go with kind and dedicated staff.",
          "Good for a rainy afternoon. Animals looked well kept. Cafe was pleasant. Arctic movie was good, and short...not too long.",
          "We all felt sad the seals had such a small enclosure, as did all the other marine creatures. I am not sure of the seals background but they seemed to be living in cramped conditions. Wish we hadn\u2019t contributed to animal captivity.",
          "I enjoyed learning about the seals and watching them, but felt concerned that their pool is too small, even if they have been brought to it young or bred in captivity. You did, however, mention that a larger outdoor area is currently under construction for them, so clearly my",
          "We loved watching the seals being trained and rewarded with food. The other fish and sea creatures were in clean tanks and looked pretty healthy too. There\u2019s a really informative display about climate change and it\u2019s effect on the glaciers too.",
          "Small museum and can be covered off in about 2hrs or less. Much of the detail is in Norwegian but they do provide a booklet summarising the info in English. Provides a good overview of the past and history. Unfortunate that a lot of it revolves around slaughter of animals \ud83d\ude22",
          "It was enjoyable visit, nothing special but it worth the visit. We arrived around 3pm, went to the coffee area, the film about the region started at 3:30pm.",
          "A small but interesting museum. You have a panoramic theater with two movies. Different explanation about the north area, weather and climate. And of course, seal, small fish. A bit expensive, 10.- CHF per adult.",
          "Really enjoyed Polaria. We watched all the films, the play area kept our son amused, lovely to see the seals at feeding time. Nice museum shop.",
          "I visited today with my daughter and we both enjoyed absolutely everything. Staff was very friendly. Playground for kids my daughter highly appreciated. Seals and fishes were just wow. I have never had so much fun in a museum \ud83d\ude00 we may visit once more",
          "My expectations were rather low. However, I found the videos very informative and they gave me a greater appreciation for nature in the area and a greater understanding of the northern lights. The site is rather small but it is charming and very well done.",

          "There\u2019s probably and hours worth of entertainment here, 90 minutes at a stretch. In saying that it\u2019s a nice exhibit and well worth a visit.",
          "This is a smaller establishment but a great place to stop and check out for about 2 hours. The seals are well trained and the trainers do a great job working with the seals and doing the presentation in two languages. They have some interesting videos on the northern lights and",
          "Our local Oceanarium in Bournemouth is no larger than this but it does pack more into the space. Here there is a limited number of displays but it is enjoyable particularly if you avoid an organised tour. The seals are great and very playful with viewing available both above",
          "This Aquarium is a lot smaller than expected. One gets to see some fish and underwater plants. They also have a touch pool, where one can touch the plants living in there. The four seals did not seem to harmonize with their trainers, the pool probably is too small. Nice",
          "This is a small aquarium. It\u2019s good to see the seals, but I\u2019d need to know more about seals to know if they really have enough space there. There are two short films to watch, which are worth catching.",
          "Visited with my adult son whilst visiting Tromso. A little disappointed with our visit here, the aquarium is not that large but it did display aquatic species that can be found in the Artic circle. I suppose more controversial is the Seal tank. It contains 4 seals (2 species),",
          "I went on a walk and because Tromso is so small, I ran into this place. It has the northern-most aquarium in the world. The seals are so cute and the show was enjoyable. The shop is fantastic! I bought the classic Norwegian sweater and a jacket and all my gifts here. I spent",
          "Small and cozy aquarium. With a nice and \"hard\" exposition regarding the pollution of the seas/world! There are several fishes but the mail attraction would be the seals; which are feed at 12:30 and 15:00. There also exists a cinema where several films are protected about the",

          "Decided to visit Polaria thinking it would have a few images / pictures / screenings and informative exhibitions but soon realised that they held captive seals. These seals on further investigation had no reason to be there other than to bring in tourists. Polaria will say",
          "They have seals in this place! LIVE SEALS! They are very adorable. they have feeding time at 3:30pm daily. I did not managed to sponsor a seal because I ran out of time to fill out the forms etc. Please do a good cause by sponsoring one of the seals. If you pay attention to",
          "Nothing much there, except for some seals and fishes. Not worth the money. Seal show was average at best.",
          "We visited Polaris because we saw a review that it is also nice for adults. I think it\u2019s more for children. The animals inside are nice but I don\u2019t know if they are happy.",
          "Easy to get there ! Very friendly people! Feeding of seals and they come close to you! You can also whatch a movie on the northern lights takes Bout 10-15 min",
          "They have lovely coral reef aquarium where you can put your hand in and ramble. For us main attraction were bearded seals. It takes not much time to visit and that\u2019s about all they have but your \u00a3\u00a3 goes to a good cause.",
          "We visited Polaria because it was suggested in lonely planet and it was cold and miserable outside. It was incredibly underwhelming. It is very small with very few animal displays and the northern lights film lasts for only 10 minutes and half of that is just a series of short",
          "Polaria is in a fascinating building, and it contains some very visual displays about the Arctic, which I think would appeal to children. It's worth seeing the panoramic films about the Northern Lights and Svalbad. The best bit is the aquarium and seals, there are some very",
          "Nice little aquarium to visit with a small seal tank. Nice to spend an hour or two at. Near center of town so its an easy walk.",
          "This is a fairly small museum but there is much sea life to see such as urchins, starfish and various species of fish. The highlight was the feeding of the seals (two Harbour seals and two Bearded seals) which appeared to be in excellent condition and well cared for by the",
          "This attraction was a bit of a letdown, definitely not the best aquarium I have ever visited. Watching the Seals getting fed and being trained is probably the most exciting part of this attraction.",
          "We spent about 1h here. We came before the seals were fed and we saw the whole show. It was nice to see what the seals are capable of. Polaria itself is a small aquarium, but it's worth the money and when there is cold outside, it's good to have an indoor option of spending",
          "We arrived just before feeding but there wasn't much room and couldn't see the seals being feed which was a shame. We did go back up to see the seal and one of the trainers was playing with the seal. She was really lovely and let our daughter take the toy and play with the seal.",
          "We spent around 1h15m here, and there are no regrets about it. It is a small place but with interesting things for both adults and children. We were able to watch the seals being fed, watch a couple of movies, one about the Aurora Borealis and another about Svalbard, in between",
          "Polaria was a fun experience. The aquarium was interesting to see all the different fish and sea creatures and learn a little about them. The seal show was very busy so I didn't see much, but it was cool to watch them respond to hand signals and they all seemed very well looked",
          "This is a cool little museum that has a panoramic cinema. I was a little disappointed with the film and the quality of the images they show in the cinema as it has great potential but it was still a nice viewing of the Lofoten Islands since I wasn\u2019t able to go there in person.",
          "The area was very crowded and We were unable to see a lot of it but what we could see was great. The animals are obviously shown a lot of love to be able to perform as they do.. Well Done to you all",
          "This is a small, but cute little aquarium. We don\u2019t have kids, But I feel that this aquarium would be perfect for kids because it\u2019s not too big it would be an easy place to tackle with kids. The seal show and training was fun to watch and interactive. Great place.",
          "Interesting panoramic film about the northern lights, four sea lions which are fed at set intervals during the day with helpful trainers on hand to answer questions. Reasonably priced coffee shop.",
          "We quite enjoyed the visit and definitely enjoyed seeing the seals very close to and it has a superb gift shop and cafe. Strange to focus on the gift shop but unlike many others, there were many things that were of interest and not much tatt. The exhibition area itself is a bit",
          "Unique place and not cheap but who going to say more when tromso near to arthic...many beatiful sea animal will be here..its their place of living.. thumb up",
          "We enjoyed walking through the museum and watching the seals being fed. I was somewhat disappointed that there was a minimum variety of sea life represented in the aquarium but the types of sea life that were there were interesting. The gift shop is quite large.",
          "Small but good to visit. Seals were fun and seeing other artic fish. Would recommend you check time for seal show otherwise quite a small museum... But seal show well worth a visit .",
          "This is a small aquarium keeping 4 seals and some fish. You will be able to finish the tour within an hour.",
          "The building is constructed in a very cool and interesting way as if it is about to fall over like dominoes. We especially enjoyed the training/ exercising of the seals. You could tell that the workers really cared about the animals.",
          "We found there to be lots of good and interesting facts. It was well spaced out. The gift shop was great too",
          "We had a nice time walking around Polaria. The aquarium is a few minutes from the city centre and is a good place to spend a couple of hours. You start off the visit by viewing a short film which explains what exactly the Northern Lights are - quite interesting. The aquarium",
          "The museum is intresting but rather smal. The interactive feeding of the seals is oke. Sorry the Polaris was not open to visit. Oke if you have a spare hour.",
          "On our 3 day break in Tromso we decided to pop here as it was raining! On entry there is a gift shop first. We bought our tickets and entered the aquarium. It was pretty nice to be fair lots of things to see and do! Our favorite was the seals and they seemed very friendly! There",
          "It was a nice place but disappointing due to the size of it. It was very small and not many aquarium species.",
          "The aquarium isn't very big, but has a few tanks of fish, urchins, and other aquatic life. The main attraction is the seals, so make sure you line up your visit with a feeding time. I got to see the seal breakfast feeding which was enjoyable to watch. Also a cool exhibit about",
          "Yes the architecture of the building is interesting, but once inside i didn't got so many new information or interesting ones as for the price paid. The seal feeding is not such big show, there are only a few seals that are swining and at spcific hour the get out to be fed by",
          "In my opinion the most interesting aspects of the Polaria Centre was the panoramic film and the exhibits related to the changing arctic. The arctic aquarium, sea pool, and seal feeding may amuse small children but are of limited interest to adults. They have a large gift shop",
          "The outside of the museum is striking - as it's meant to look like ice flows. I really enjoy visiting aquariums and thought it would be really neat to visit one about the animals that live in the Arctic. While there are some interesting tanks, the inside is very small and I",
          "This is an experiance for the hole family. You can see the feeding of the seals. There are many interesting sea creatures to watch. In the shop you can buy sustainably produced things.",
          "We visited yesterday as a family of four after reading the mixed reviews and deciding to visit anyway. We arrived in time for a video on the Northern Lights at noon followed by what seems to be the star attraction - the feeding of the seals at 12:30pm. In the interim we walked",
          "We visited this aquarium at the end of the day in Tromso. The highlight was the feeding of the bearded and harbour seals. This was educational and enthralling. The other exhibits were interesting and there was plenty of variety in the marine life on display. The climate change",
          "Very interesting building design. Like falling dominoes. This aquarium has very educational exhibits of sea life. We enjoyed the live seal feeding show. Some walks are under the aquarium and you can see seals swim by overhead. The 2 movie shows in the theater are worth seeing.",
          "Godd museum. The exterior is fancy, and the start of the museum starts with a short film of the wildlife and nature around Troms\u00f8. Amazing effect in the room they show it. Its breathtakingly beautiful. The seals are fun to watch, especially the one swimming on his back in a",
          "We started with the panoramic movie and then moved on to the seals and then the fish tanks. It is very focused on the polar environment and very interesting and educational. If you have an hour or two to spend in the town, I recommend it.",
          "The structure of the museum is interesting. A short walk from the cruise ship dock and a nice way to spend an hour if it is cold and wet. Small number of seals, but not top of our list",
          "The films were great A lot of information for all Great for all ages, the kids liked it Seals were a bit over rated",
          "If you have some time on your hands, a visit will keep you occupied. The high point is the ice cave, but you will enjoy the seal feeding if you go at noon! The Northern lights and other shows are very good graphics, but they just about give an idea of the occurrence. Overall ok,",
          "Was on a cruise and visited Polaria. There was an early Seal Feeding session at 1030am besides the scheduled 1230pm session probably due to anticipation of the cruise crowd. Overall, a value for money attraction.",
          "We learned a lot about conservation efforts and important information about global warming. Also there was an interesting video about plastics and ways to recycle them. Preciousplastic.com.",
          "This museum is very informative. Accessible and welcoming. The scale of the place allows the visitors to get very close to the wildlife on display and to have in-depth conversation with the Animal keepers. We attended the 10:45 breakfast feeding of the Bearded seals and the",
          "The museum tries to explain what is happening to the area in respect to global warming, through films and interactive exhibits, a great place to visit.",
          "The central pool is the one where the seals live - it's pretty big and they have a cozy \"beach\" to rest on as well. I think they're accustomed to getting fed by people because they often were swimming next to us doing funny poses and tricks, most likely expecting a treat ;)",
          "Its not a huge place, but its really quite nice to visit the seals and see the little tricks they can do!",
          "Polaris great building. The exhibits were okay. The seal feeding was cool and so was the northern lights show. Easy to get to by walking or cab. Teen got bored but he still liked going through it.",
          "The external architecture of the building is nice and different .It has a 15 minutes planetarium show about Northern Lights and for kids few fishes and seals to watch and enjoy the Arctic life.They also have a kids play area too where my daughter enjoyed a lot.",
          "perfect place to be for having an introduction to the challenges the arctic region is facing. good that they are also renovating the building",
          "fairly unassuming aquarium. can spend an hour or two here if the weather is bad outside (as it is frequently).",
          "There was a panoramic cinema with some interesting footage - but if you have watched Blue Planet little new. The aquarium was a disappointment and although the keeper goes to some length to reassure us that the seal training is more scientific than performance - I was not",
          "I've worked in shop stockrooms that were bigger than this place. You can walk around the entire space and see all the animals in five minutes. It's only worth the entrance fee if you time your arrival for the bearded seal feeding and training sessions at 12:30pm and 3pm. If",
          "Here you can see and experience trained bearded seal at close range. Aquariums and panoramic cinema will enrich your knowledge. A place the whole family can enjoy. No doubt here you can get an understanding of Arctic life.",
          "A smaller space than expected, takes 1 hour to complete the visit. the show in the theatre is a good intro to the trip.",
          "It's good if you have children and it's raining. In any other case, not a must see in Tromso. They should do something much more modern and high tech on the subject.",
          "I loved seal feedings (I think its at 12:30 and 17:30, so time your visit accordingly). Get to the seal area early as it fills up quickly. VERY nice gift shop, too! They have a great cafe above the gift shop, too.",
          "A small aquarium, but the seal feeding time is worth the visit, then standing in the glass tunnels to watch them swim over. Well kept. The cinema was also good to tell us about the Northern Lights, as we were never lucky enough to see the real thing!!",
          "We were just doing a walk around town and decided to stop in to see what this was. We happened to get there right before the seal feeding, so went in. For a small aquarium, it was pretty well done and we enjoyed the visit. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to see it -",
          "Even though there want a wide variety of animals at the aquarium the seals were amazing and very well looked after!",
          "Cute to see all the sea life, different to places I've been before. Highlight was definitely seeing the seals being played with and fed",
          "An interactive museum for kids learning about the human effect in the sea. Seal feeding was fun. You could probably spend about an hour here. The cafe was nice and the food fresh. Its a little expensive if you went by english price and wages but this is norway and its only",
          "Very interesting well worth a visit. Lots to see. Would recommend. Seal show and got northern lights film to watch.",
          "A small scale aquarium with no real outstanding exhibits, easily done within an hour even with taking in the seal feeding. There is a coffee shop upstairs which is reasonably priced by Norway standards.",
          "The museum is small. The souvenir area is huge. You can see seals which is pretty cool and the Northern Lights video on the big screen .The other video is an awful quality. Mixed experience.",
          "This aquarium is located in the city, the building is uniquely shaped you wouldn't miss it. The collection is limited to several seals and some interesting arctic marine lifeforms. There are some interactive games about the impact of marine pollution to the wildlife. Get there",
          "The museum is located in the city. It can be viewed in sea dogs including in their feeding performances. As well as widescreen movies. They also enjoyed visiting the place as a couple. Especially suitable for families with children",
          "The exceptional architecture outweighs the modest scope of the aquarium it houses. Geared mostly toward children, Polaria mostly depicts a romanticized marine environment. We enjoyed the films on Svalbard\u2019s wildlife and the aurora borealis, but not much of the rest was",
          "Had a fun day in Polaria. I love most their aquarium. The seals seem to be very friendly qnd playful. The staffs are very accomodating. They adjusted the showing time of northern lights to fit in our sched. Fantastic!",
          "Very small and hardly any creatures. About \u00a312 for entry. I saw the seals being fed, but beyond that, a few fish and some starfish and shellfish.",
          "Me and a friend spent the first half of our morning in the Polaria aquarium. Its a very small and pleasant aquarium. Its main attraction was the seals, which we watched for a while before they had a feeding and training demonstration. It was quite busy, which not much room to",
          "In Polaria you can see some very well made videos showing the northern Lights and you can see the seals being fed.",
          "Polaria is a nice aquarium with polar aquatic life. The main attractions are the sea lions /walruses in the big pool. Underwater viewing tunnel is cool. Also a nice audiovisual show and a good cafe. Good play area too for younger kids",
          "It's not a big aquarium, but you can learn about the specific species of this area and the climate change effects. You should be there at 12:30 and 15:30 if you want to see the seals feeding and training.",
          "The seals are definitely the highlight, unfortunately they have a pretty small enclosure but they seem well looked after. This was a good way to spend an hour and a half. The films (northern lights and Svalbard) are good, the one on Northern Lights isn't very scientifically",
          "Even before entering we got the idea that we\u2019re gonna like it, based on the unique aspect. We got to see seals and two movies (one about aurora and the other about the wilderness of Svalbard island).",
          "We spent a lovely hour and a half here one Sunday afternoon and a highlight of the experience was watching them train and feed the seals. You got the genuine feeling that the animals loved it. It\u2019s not a big place so there wasn\u2019t a huge amount to see for the price paid but I",
          "There isn\u2019t much to do in Troms\u00f8 in the afternoons after you\u2019ve done your day trips if you\u2019re not into stuffed animal museums or beer so as we are nature lovers this museum appealed the most. It\u2019s 140 nok or so each to get in (\u00a312.30 each). Go when the seal show is planned, we",
          "This is definitely not a large aquarium but for the cost of entry, it is well worth a visit. It is easy to navigate through the place and you even have a short film to watch if you need some rest time off your feet. The exhibits are interesting and seeing the seals play up",
          "I agree with those who have said that there is little to see, but might (just) be OK to pass an hour. Although it is good to see animals close up - I did feel uneasy about the poor seals living a life confined here.",
          "Not much to see, went to pass the time during the middle of the day as most activities here are morning or night.. Seal feeding was good to see but they performed all seal tricks at the same time so was hard to keep up sometimes seeing which seal was performing. Rest if the",
          "The 9 min show in the amphiteatre is a good experience. The seal's being fed are also a good attraction. It a small museum but good for kids",
          "Not too expensive to enter but there really isn't a great deal to see. Rather a small pool for the sea lions though.",
          "Excellent films, needs more exhibits/sea life. The gift shop takes almost as long to go thru as the aquarium itself. A little disappointing.",
          "Although small, the visit in the Acquarium is a must for visitors in Tromso. Good meal too. Friendly people.",
          "Fairly basic aquarium. Some interesting displays especially around global warming and changes on the ice cap. Some good displays of the impact of plastics on the oceans including visualisation of how micro plastics are ingested by plankton. I really saw very little point in the",
          "Our visit to Polaria was a mixed experience. Films were ok, and the place has some interesting things. The best part was the feeding and training of the seals, the highlight of the place.",
          "En famille (2 adultes et adolescents), nous avons visit\u00e9 ce mus\u00e9e : les 2 films sont magnifiques ; l\u2019aquarium est pas mal. Sans plus. Ce mus\u00e9e est r\u00e9cent, mais nettement moins complet que le Polar mus\u00e9um. Et plus cher. As a family (2 adults and 2 youths), we have visited this",
          "We were in tromso in bad weather and our trips were cancelled so went here for a few hours. Some very interesting marine life. Great for children. They show 2 films - wildlife of Norway one showed some nice footage but there was no information given. Then a second film about the",
          "We visited Polaria as a family and it was \u00a344. This museum is basically a small aquarium based on the polar region with its main attraction of 3 seals. It would be fine for small children but it is small and very dated",
          "We visited here on a grey rainy day and it killed a couple of hours but that was all. There wasn\u2019t a lot to see, tanks of star fish and a few tanks of fish. The main thing to look at were the seals. The panoramic theatre was good with a nice film about Svalbard.",
          "A great time spent here ideal to see what is here and enjoy the experience. A bit crowded at the seal pool, so waited for another showing.",
          "The place is not that big, but the presentations about Northern lights and Svalbard were great. Even only for that I think is good to visit.",
          "The seals were fun to watch, but overall it was very small. My kids like the little play area they had.",
          "This was a nice place to visit with small children. My kids are 4 and 6 and they both enjoyed it here. They liked the seal feeding and really enjoyed the ocean talk where they were able to hold sea urchins, star fish and crabs. Nice time for families",
          "Amazing place, saw the seals swimming around us via a tunnel then watched them at 12.30 being fed. Get to spot early or you can\u2019t see. Had video on northern lights too",
          "Polaria is a perfectly nice, very simple aquarium. There\u2019s a small movie theater with 10 minute films, some educational material about the disappearing sea ice, a few fish exhibits and four seals. The seals are lovely and if you get to see a training session, it\u2019s good fun. A",
          "The movies are not very good . There are very few explanations and the place is very small. So much could have been done on polar world!! Disappointing",
          "On the day that the wheather was wet we visited Polaria. Great place to visit, especially the 2 movies that were shown. One of Polar life and one of the Northern Light. Also the seals, fishes etc were nice to visit. The restaurant served great drinks and food.",
          "We visited Polaria by coincidence a couple of days before our planned visit date \u2013 We were driving to catch lunch in the city, but missed a turn in the city tunnels and ended up at the traffic light opposite Polaria. Polar night, heavy snowfall and 2 kids - it was a no brainer",
          "Would recommend this when in Troms\u00f8, especially if the weather outside isn\u2019t that great. The highlight of the aquarium has to be the seals (2 beaded seals and 2 harbour seals). Also an interesting exhibit about glacial retreat and ice cores just after the panoramic cinema.",
          "Killing time before we needed to head for the airport, the two videos were very good & enjoyable. Though the centre itself is quite small, perfect for families with children, who enjoy seeing sea lions.",
          "The architecture was definitely the best part of this. It was part of a Hurtigruten Tromso city tour and was in lieu of the Arctic Museum which was closed for restoration. I definitely wouldn't have gone independently and was puzzled why anyone would go. We were herded in and",
          "The seadog show, the arctic video, all the fish, the little shop. I have no regrets visiting this place.",
          "I recommend visiting Polaria! Nice souvenir shop, the aquarium is really nice and the seals are lovely!",
          "A good place to visit for a few hours , to see the local marine life and also see the seals , there is also a very good film show",
          "Well worth the visit, very engaging and the seals are great. A good walk along the sea front to the Polaria but superb scenery.",
          "Polaria wasn't a good experience for us and we can't recommend to go there. The aquariums are looking quite old and are way too small for the animals. It's just sad to see. There are some films about the Northern Lights and Svalbard which where ok. Some other films didn't work",
          "A small aquarium that also has a seal pool. the training/feeding happens a couple of times a day and is interesting and fun. The rest of the aquarium is realtively small and you can probably spend an hour to 90 minutes here.",
          "Loved the short films and of course the seals. What a display they put up at feeding time. Joy to watch",
          "A small aquarium with cute seals. Good to drop in, if you are nearby. There is a small feeding show twice a day ( in winter at 12:30 and 15:30, about 15-20 minutes).",
          "tour took approx an hour. all sorts of marine life on display. feeding time for the seals was really great to see. nice caf\u00e9 upstairs also for a coffee. great spot and well worth visiting.",
          "Loved the seals. Several other fish and sea plants etc. A bit pricey to enter like everywhere else in Tromso. About 18 usd for adults. Nice movie about Tromso and the arctic.",
          "Excited to see Polaria, I was not quite impressed of what is inside, or at least did not meet my expectations. Not far from the city center, a easy to access location with the entrance fee of about 15 \u20ac. The souvenir shop has some interesting things and it\u2019s hard not to buy",
          "This was a really nice place to visit and extremely interesting. The seals were fascinating to watch. We were a little worried about the space they had but they seem well cared for.",
          "We went as the arctic museum was closed. Was a bit disappointed. The best part were the seals who swam over head. The seal training was good to watch but the rest was a bit boring.",
          "Enjoyed an hour and half here. Good info and seals. Not too far out of town and had reduced rate for seniors",
          "Could be so much better but really consists of not much more than an opportunity to watch two slightly dated films about the Aurora and Svalbard and four seals being fed. Yes, there are other smaller exhibits but even so, there\u2019s barely enough going on to pass an hour.",
          "What a wonderful place Great price to enter. Watching the seals do tricks at tea time was so cute and the trainers are very caring. You can also watch a movie about the northern lights. Worth the trip",
          "We spent approx 1,5-2 hours here. The aquarium\u2019s outer architecture is stunning, inside we\u2019ve found the collection a bit small and the design a little bit outdated (eg. seal swimming pool needed new paint). The show was very fun to watch!",
          "A very nice place with good information about the arctic, interesting aquariums and even seals, but the pool for the seals could be a little big bigger.",
          "Not an overly large aquarium but informative and well laid out with English/Norwegian information. Certainly worth a visit when you'd rather be indoors .",
          "We got to watch two films here. One was explaining the origin of northern lights in a very scientific manner. Quite elaborate and provided good knowledge. Second one was even better. It had an excellent audio visual know-how of birds and animals in the Arctic region. The film",
          "Interesting films shown in the museum (to prepare you for aurora observation); nice to watch the seals' feeding.",
          "The staff were exceptionally friendly and very helpful. Answered any questions we had and had a fantastic video explaining the northern lights inside. Worth a visit.",
          "Informative and every 30 min different activities like short movies in the panorama theatre or the feeding / training time with the seals.",
          "We arrived to watch the seals being fed breakfast. So helpful staff willing to tell us all about the work they do. Some very interesting films to watch and sights to see. Also a very nice gift shop and cafe. A great trip that we highly recommend.",
          "Polaria is a centre of excellence in Arctic sea-life research that is open to the public as a small natural history museum, aquarium & seal pool. There is also a panoramic cinema, a cafe & gift shop selling Nordic goods. The highlight is the feeding & training of the bearded &",
          "We visited here on a very rainy day hoping to spend a few hours, however it was all very disappointing. The seals are the main attraction and there is little else. The movie they played in the theatre was very old and the rest of the place is very tired and outdated. Outdated in",
          "This is well worth the visit. Aquarium and panoramic theatre in one. We found the museum very interesting for anyone interested in the polar environment.",
          "I liked watching as the seals were fed and performed a few tricks. It's a good place to stop to warm up and spend a little time if the weather's not cooperating. However, I don't think I would visit again. It just wasn't enough to keep me there. I walked through fairly quickly",
          "Small aquarium. Don\u2019t arrive expecting sea life galore. Seals are nice to watch but the 12 midday feed never happened so we just watched them for half an hour or so. Lots of Rockpool life ( anemones, hermit crabs, shellfish) climbing wall and play area is good for kids. Ok",
          "With a blizzard raging outside we decided to head indoors to Polaria. A lot of folk had taken the same view so it was pretty busy. We arrived just in time to catch the seal training. They have four seals who they weighted and put through some activities while they fed them.",
          "A nice place to spend a rainy afternoon. Compared to other aquariums and science centers, it's pretty meagre, but it has an interesting video or two and a really good gift shop to spend a rainy afternoon.",
          "The building is beautiful and really nice to see how it was built to look like glaciers. Don't pass by the big signs outside (free to look) to read about the important work. Inside for a few, there are several small aquariums and one seal exhibit. They do a great job of",
          "My family and I were very excited to visit the Polaria hoping to learn about polar/arctic life however we were significantly disappointed. We arrived 9 minutes before a seal feeding and we were told to quickly make our way to the back of the aquarium. We moved quickly to see it",
          "Nice but small aquarium at the edge of the city. Seal feeding and show was fun to watch. There were plenty of exhibits to see as well. Cafe upstairs was closed when we went.",
          "On our visit we found the narrative of the exhibition to be quite weak it would be nice if there was more of a story rather than what felt like a collection of exhibits. The stars of the place of course are the seals which are lovely. The bearded seals are huge and the tricks",
          "It was a great place to visit. A lovely aquarium and the seals were just beautiful. They had a great variety of fish and crustaceans. Also they showed us a film about the northern lights that was very enlightening. Just one small thing: For the seal feeding it\u2019s best to be a",
          "Great for a short visit, this small aquarium has some interesting sea life and an important message about the loss of ice in the polar region. The four resident seals are very sweet and were good fun to watch at feeding time. The cafe and shop were of good quality and had",
          "This is a nice little but cute aquarium. They show couple of movies. Nothing spectacular, but good fun for kids. We read a lot about seal feeding and had waited there to see. But, we found it jam packed and could not really see what was happening and hence a bit disappointed.",
          "Polaria is located quite near town centre , just a short walk. This is a good place to visit for familiies with growing children and people of all ages. The life seal pool and hands on touch pools are good experiences for the young ones . Helpful documentaries on the Northern",
          "Cant believe that Troms\u00f8 with so beautiful nature arould it has so boring aquarium. There was almost nothing to see. Seals were nice but their enviroment made me feel sorry for them. Films and theatre were not from this century. Not worth money!",
          "The seals are easily the best bit, so you must visit during feeding time and you get to see how clever the seals are. The two \u2018films\u2019 shown were made in the 80s and were a waste of my time. I did not leave the films knowing anything about Svalbard or the northern lights, it just",
          "Cannot believe such a progressive,forward thinking country has a prison for beautiful sentient beings. The seal enclosure is solitary confinement. Stop it now. Set them free.",
          "It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t enjoy it, I just feel like I did the entire thing in about half an hour to an hour and that was stretching it out! Like I said it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t enjoy what I did it\u2019s just there isn\u2019t a tonne there to see and do",
          "Feeding of the seals was fun. Interesting film presentation. Nice small coffee shop. Friendly staff. Not a huge place exhibit wise",
          "It is very nice to visit, and we strongly recommend to adopt seal so they can build a bigger pool soon! Very friendly stuff!!!",
          "A small place with the single item of interest being 4 seals. Make sure you go during feeding times. The seals were totally cute and playful, but to be honest we were a bit sad they were in captivity.",
          "Visited as red a lot about this place. It wasn\u2019t breathtaking but interesting. Not big, 2 hours and that it. But - seals are funny. Feeding and training time was interesting (staff said - this is not show just possibility to train brain and body for seals). Good cafeteria with",
          "Spent a couple of hours here, not as exciting as Lonely planet guide made it our to be, and sea life were in small areas, needed more room",
          "Small exhibition but nice place to visit. Two short films - one about the Northern Lights and the other about Svalbard - were good, and the seal feeding in between was good fun.",
          "The only thing good about the place was the architecture of the building . We watched both movies they played at the museum, and the aquarium with the bearded seals could use some upgrade. We didnt wait to feed the seals.",
          "This aquarium was worth a visit, especially during the seal feeding presentation. The overall building is quite small, but we spent about an hour walking through. Wish there were more staff available for questions as we went through the exhibits.",
          "A nice little spot to stop and see a couple movies on the northern lights and arctic regions. A special moment to watch seals being fed and trained made this a lot of fun! Touching pools, areas for little ones, a cafe and gift shop were all very nice. My son wanted to go a",
          "Polaria likes to say it\u2019s the worlds most Northerly aquarium, and personally that\u2019s all I think it\u2019s claim to fame is. its designed more for children so I\u2019m wondering why it was on our itinerary. What I liked the most was the 5 screen panoramic screen which showed 2 movies one",
          "We visited here hoping for information on the polar environment. It had some displays but half of the interactive information didn\u2019t seem to work. There wasn\u2019t much information overall at all and what there was seemed confusing. The beat bit was the four seals but it wasn\u2019t",
          "I expected much more interesting aquarium than what I found. Very old fashioned place. The gift shop is the best thing in the Polaria. The water of the aquarium is bit dirty. They have a theater and I saw some interesting movies about the Aurora and the Arctic life.",
          "Very outdated with stuffed seagulls and cramped area for the seals with little apparent stimulation or varied environment for them",
          "Polaria offers some nice information on the Arctic nature. However, everything seems a bit untidy and oldfashioned. It is exciting to see the sea animals in the different aquariums and ponds. However, the thrill may only be with children. Also, the movie theatre smells bad. I",
          "high price entr\u00e9 fee but lots of info and film plus live show of bearded seals and a shop which had very good souvenir. Q&A at the end of live show was fine.",
          "We went Tromso for lots of winter activities but sadly no snow or ice so needed things to do so we came here. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. They have a cinema to watch a show of how beautiful Norway is then you get to walk around the centre and look at the tanks",
          "Please save your money and moral integrity and just do not visit this \u201cmuseum\u201d. My friends and I made the mistake of not doing any research on this place before paying 100 kr and entering, only to see at least 5 seals enclosed in a ridiculously tiny space. The staff explained",
          "I\u2019m giving 1/5 just because I can\u2019t give 0/5. The museum is not worth your money and your moral integrity, there is nothing interesting. The space for the animals is so small they can\u2019t even swim properly. Make animals an attraction is already bad by itself but keeping them in",
          "We walked there from our hotel. It was cold and windy, but it was worth it. They had a deal show, 4 of them and a big tank with very strange fish. Very oriented towards climate changes. I liked it.",
          "It is a small aquarium to the South of the centre of town. The seal show was very good, they had a few other attractions inside, but we were all done in an hour. We opted not to watch the 2 films that were in the theatre.",
          "The aquarium was nice. There were not too many tanks. The seals area was a bit small in my opinion although was fascinating to see them. Nice reasonably priced gift shop there.",
          "Along our seafront walk, we happened upon Polaria, with its most uniquely designed building and decided to check it out - what a nice surprise! We watched an amazing video (drone/helicopter) of Norway's beautiful coastline, islands, mountains and wildlife. Learned about",
          "Loved the exterior architecture of the building as soon as we walked up. Learned lots of interesting facts about local wildlife that I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to otherwise. The seal training was great and we loved the aquariums with the fish and mollusks!",
          "Quite an underwhelming place. The seal conservation and conservation work as a whole excepting, I was very disappointed. The gift shop seemed to have more effort put into it than the exhibits themselves. The building would have been interesting to photograph but for all the vans",
          "Interesting aquarium, specially if you consider it's the most northerly aquarium. The seals - and their feeding time - are by far the best of it. There are also activities for kids, but as I traveled alone I can't make opinions on them.",
          "Interesting short films (about several topics, eg. auroras) and exhibitions about northern sea life as well as topics surrounding ice caps and melting thereof and ocean pollution. Watching the seals (during feeding and training as well as before that) was fun and worthwhile. We",
          "Well worth a visit. Very good value. The architecture of the building is unusual. Lovely to get up close to the seals.",
          "very small aquarium but the seal feeding was worth the visit. it is not a show but a true feeding and play/mental stimulation secession. they are amazing creatures and we were lucky to get this up close experience.",
          "But also enjoyed the aquarium specially the smaller pools. Plenty to see plus a souvenir shop. Worth a visit.",
          "This is a small and somewhat underwhelming aquarium. They have a few small tanks with crabs, anemone, flat fish. The star attraction are 4 rescued seals which are fed twice a day whilst given some \"tricks\" and activities to provide the animals with some stimulation. This",
          "Fun aquarium which centred around the seal exhibit. Best to arrive at feeding time to see their training and learn about them in more detail. Touch pool and short clips also very good",
          "I paid 70nok for student ticket. I can see some short movies about northern lights and animals, and there were great pools that we can see seals and fish. This place is not that big, but so exciting! And also it has a nice souvenir shop. Strongly recommend to visit here!",
          "This is a definitely a must do if you visit Tromso. It\u2019s small but tons of information on artic life. We arrived at 10, the seal breakfast feeding was at 10.30, great to see these amazing animals so close. We opted to stay in for the seal show at 12.30, great show, nice activity",
          "Visited as part of a shore excursion from a ship as now my kids have grown up I don't usually visit these kind if places, but it was interesting as it's Norway and I love Norway! There's seals and fish and a big 5 screen cinema type thing and a fair bit of educational stuff.",
          "The seals are the main attraction and well worth the price of admission. Don't expect too much else. The place feels very dated on the inside and isn't very big. But the staff are friendly and the seals are wonderful. Not much else to see unfortunately. The outside of the",
          "Good value for money. Two informative films about the Northern Lights and the polar area. Feeding of the seals. Good souvenir shop.",
          "Really interesting exhibits and the seals are incredible. They are fantastic to watch. There is a nice cafe on the first floor and the gift shop is fab. You can't miss the building, it looks like a stack of dominos that have been pushed over. Great architecture.",
          "This was our first visit. It is good for children, little are to play. The seals are very visible but do have a small area for 4 big seals. Short film on Northern Lights. Great gift shop.",
          "We went here and instantly were told that seal feeding was about to happen so we went to the pool and watched the trainers interact with the seals. Was lovely. We then went around the aquarium looking at the native sea creatures, with lots to see and read. There was a small play",
          "The tour guide told us that this museum is the best in Tromso. It is an amalgamation of a documentary film about the history and life on remote Spitzenbergen (Svalbard) Island, arctic aquarium with underwater tunnel, and seal show. There are also educational exhibits about",
          "We enjoyed a short visit to the Polaria as it isn't too big. The aquarium is small but great especially the seals. Go to watch feeding time as this is the best bit!",
          "This is a great place to visit staff were friendly and very helpful. Did not take hours was perfect just to chill inside. Nice and clean",
          "While visiting relatives in Tromso we went to the Polaria. It is a small aquarium museum you can watch them feed the seals as they do tricks but in a small area so you better get there early at feeding time in order to get a good viewing spot. There are several displays and you",
          "I loved this local attraction. It\u2019s small, but there is a lot to see, from the family of seals, to the panorama film presentations, to the live fish & animals that live in the Arctic. There is also a cafe, environment exhibitions & a shop. If you\u2019re visiting Troms\u00f8 it\u2019s well",
          "Very nice place to see and learn about life in the artic, movies about northern lights and seals swimming around you!! Fun experience for all the family!! You can learn and have fun. They have a good souvenir shop too! Seals are nice and friendly.",
          "It was very exciting to see the seals, but they had way to little space. We where told they where exersiced 5 times a day, which is good, but they where clearly understimulated and repeating the same moved over and over. For the sake of the animals I would never recomend this",
          "Very small aquarium with a limited display of fish and 4 seals. There are 2 videos available, one on the Svalbard island and one on the northern lights. They do not have an commentary to them however. You can watch the seal feeding but if you are not there at that time it is",
          "We knew going in that this was a small aquarium, so we didn\u2019t allot much time to walk through. We watched a short film on Svalbard and the wildlife that live there, and then made our way through in probably 20 minutes, taking our time at each stop. The best part was the seal",
          "There is also a short paranormal film about Northern lights and seal feeding at 12:30. Check on their website for more information.",
          "Loved the design of the building. Got to see the feeding show of the seals and behaviors. I thought could use more displays for the aquarium animals. Having explored nearby spots like sommaroy, saw some beautiful wild jellies. Adding jelly exhibits to this space would really",
          "This place has two great films of Svalbard and the Northern lights. It also has some sea animals in it. The employees are very nice and helpful.",
          "It was raining all day we were there so this was a fun inside activity. See the feeding of the seals. Takes about 90 minutes to tour.",
          "Short glance into the world of arctic creatures. Transparent glass corridor where the seals swim around you. Interesting for all ages. Lucky if you could plan the time of your visit to see the seal feeding and show.",
          "Our daughter loves to see wildlife. We went to the Polaria to visit and see the seal feeding. The seals would swim right over to the glass and interact with the guest. Our daughter loved the experience. There was also an exhibit were the children could touch sea life. They",
          "I had luck, cause i arrived before the feed time for the seals. You cant see much, but its also not very expensive (for norway).",
          "Beautiful film on Arctic life in the wild & Northern lights. Enclosure for seal & different species of fish is interesting. They have nice cafe & souvenir shop.",
          "We visited during an excursion from our cruise ship. There were a ton of people in a relatively small area and much confusion seeing the movie and viewing the exhibits. First we were seated and then told to get up and come back later. We wandered around among the large crowd and",
          "Try to get here for show with the seals at feeding time. Unfortunately I was on my way to the airport and pressed for time so I didn't get to spend as long here as I would otherwise have liked.",
          "Great place for everyone!!! I love seals!!! Also I really enjoyed both movies, about Svalbard and polar light!",
          "We enjoyed seeing the northern lights in the film and learning about the different kinds of fish and other wildlife.",
          "This was part of a tour so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the two movies they showed us as well as the aquarium itself. One was the Northern lights, the other was on Svalbard. Both were great! There was no water show while we were here, but it was fun to watch the",
          "Museum has as the main attraction seals in large aquarium including feeding show. Nice panoramic movie on Svalbard. Some interactive attractions, unfortunately not all of them worked.",
          "I really liked to visit Polaria, the buiilding itself is rather strange, with these big white bloks one over the other, that should represent a falling glacier or something like this. In side it has different exchibitions about animal life in the arctic regions and some pools",
          "Nice small aquarium with plenty of opportunity for children to get their hands in the water and touch some of the sea life. They have a short movie that highlights the local coast and have a regular feed schedule and shows with the seals. Great for children",
          "The aquarium is quite small, I expected more exhibits, but it\u2019s nice. Don\u2019t expect to spend more that maximum two hours there.",
          "Good amount of information about the Arctic if you don't know anything about it. Small aquarium, however very well done. The 15 minute movie on Svalbard was very interesting.",
          "The Polaria is a good museum and aquarium where you can learn more about the polar region and enjoy a short seal demonstration. Worth an hour or so and there is an arctic expedition seal hunting ship next door (I think there is a potential to buy tickets for both attractions",
          "Most northern aquarium. A short walk from our hotel at the Clarion. A very modern building. Great films and great exhibition put on by the seals.",
          "If you want to spend an hour inside a building to hide from sun or snow. This is the place to be. Interesting and amazing movie about Svalbard. You could easily watch 30 minutes to the seals. The melting of the ice is a reality check. You can see the impact of the global",
          "I saw 2 panaramic films here on the Polar North and the Northern Lights which were very good and informative. It is only a small place but well worth a visit. The aquarium was nice and I particularly enjoyed the seal feeding with the bearded seals. Next door is an old seal",
          "The Polaria shows two movies about the Northern Lights and local aquatics, and contains a large aquarium housing a number of seals and king crabs along with articles about arctic sea life.",
          "Lots to see and great caf\u00e9. Good for adults and school age children. Very interesting videos and a few interactive displays",
          "Very nice movies about the artic and Spitsbergen. Show with seals!! Poor animals in small bassins. But good museum.",
          "The attraction is an indoor arctic sea life aquarium, so it\u2019s great for kids. There were also some films worth watching.",
          "First, let me say, I love this place sentimentally. My wife and I first visited here as newlyweds and I was charmed by this little niche aquarium. But I am a marine biologist and avowed aquarium enthusiast and have seen some major and impressive aquariums around the world, so",
          "Best on quiet days when you can take time and space to fully appreciate your surroundings, educational and the seals are amazing to watch, the shows they do are unique and entertaining, its worth a visit",
          "Excellent museum explaining life if the Artic, breathtaking film shows. The architecture is a work of art in itself!",
          "Polaria needs a technology upgrade in terms of wide view cinema, needs more impressive aquaria and a better sea lion resort. There are nowadays better musea of this kind.",
          "Visited as part of cruise stop. The 15 minute film was the highlight but even that could have been better filmed and the music did nothing to enhance the experience. The ceiling map of the reducing ice cap was interesting as was the amount of plastic and debris in the ocean.",
          "Honestly, there is not that much to see here. The best part are the films. Others in my group were excited about the seal \"show,\" but I quickly got bored with it and walked on. Not sure how the show jibes with their environmental emphasis. Some of the other fish exhibits were",
          "This is an interesting smallish attraction. We saw a film and the seal feeding and looked at the other exhibits. It\u2019s probably only an hour max at this exhibit.",
          "I saw the interesting panoramic cinema about the northerly islands of Svalbard, but I didn\u2019t see the world's most northerly aquarium. I do not like to see trained seals performances. The seals should be in the seas, where they belong.",
          "Our visit was the part of the social program while we were in Tromso for a meeting. The building is very interesting. You can see very different arctic animals in the aquarium. I've seen a wolf fish alive first time in my life. But I felt a little bit depressed to see seals that",
          "The Polaria Museum is a short walk along the harbour front from the tourist information office in Tromso. You pay an entry fee. The building is unusual and impressive to look at and seems to represent large blocks of ice. 2 films are available to watch, one on the Arctic areas",
          "Very interesting place for adults and kids. Many informations about arctic life. Seal shows, two films on panoramic screen, a lot of news, curiosities. I recommend.",
          "We found this museum a little disappointing. The films were quite good, especially the one on the Northern Lights, and we enjoyed seeing the seals being fed. But the rest of the exhibits were less interesting and you can see the whole place in about an hour and a half. We would",
          "Really enjoyed our visit here. The seals were entertaining and fascinating to watch swimming up close. The northern lights video was informative without being too long and boring. It\u2019s a good way to spend a cold winters day.",
          "Norway is generally environmentally aware and Polaris provides accessible teaching about the effects of global warming and the costs of plastic being thrown away. The films in the Panorama Theatre are excellent and the feeding of the seals is also an educational opportunity.",
          "There are a number of small aquatic exhibits showing arctic marine life. The largest is a seal tank with 3 seals. Not much explanation in English, unfortunately, but the fish themselves are pretty interesting.",
          "So its got a big exhibition about the dangers of plastic in the ocean, and exhibits made by children (as they are the ones who will inherit this mess we've left) all very good until you to the restaurant and they give you a plastic straw! The food there is nice BTW but single",
          "Went here on a rainy day and enjoyed the wildlife information. Also lots of info on the plastics problem. Some cool fish. Wasn\u2019t sure about the seals tho...felt bad small tank.",
          "Polarium is place divided into shop and museum. Shop is nice with lot of suveniers and postcards and in museum was the most interesting pool with see water with a sea lion. I never seen something like this so i was amazed. The pool have glasses window and you could see animals",
          "I have never seen bearded seals before, so this was an ideal opportunity to see them close up. I am not keen on seals or any animal in captivity, but they were not wild born, and kept in excellent conditions. There were excellent presentations on many aspect of the Arctic seas,",
          "Prepared for 2 hours to visit but too short for my kid, other than seal show & lot of theme, there is a small indoor playground perfect for my 5yr old kid. It\u2019s highly recommended for family with kids that can spend 3~4 hrs. Cafe is there but closed early, have no chance to try",
          "A very quirky building houses a small indigenous animal observation facility. Watching seals swim from underneath was good. The panoramic cinema presentations were excellent if you were a first time visitor to the area. It is not a place you would go back to but enjoyable",
          "We visited here in March whilst we were in port on a ship. An interesting centre when you arrive, with the building constructed to give the effect of pack ice crunching together. Excellent multi media movies....one on the Northern Lights which was just outstanding and the",
          "Its a small aquarium with few fishes, amazing seals and a small panoromic theater. If you plan to go to Polaria, plan your visit according to the feeding times and be there much earlier so that u get a good spot to have closer look. It was more like a show where the seals",
          "The aquarium itself was mildly interesting, however, I was shocked and very upset to see the tiny enclosure where three unfortunate seals are destined to spend their lives without even being able to see the sky, or fresh air! The feeding is laughingly called an 'enrichment'",
          "Spent about an hour here one snowy day and people were lovely, but there wasn\u2019t much exceptional to the museum itself. The sea lion feeding/training was vaguely interesting, but the 2 panoramic films weren\u2019t overly educational. Kept me occupied on a day that I didn\u2019t feel much",
          "Stopped off here for a look. Plenty of info on the Northern Lights . Abit of an aquarium and the highlight is watching seals being fed.",
          "The aquarium was ok but my kids are already teens or maybe we have already seen a number of big aquariums that is why this small one seemed a little bit boring. Small children will still be thrilled to watch the seals",
          "Polaria is just a basic aquarium that also houses Bearded and Habour seals. I did not find this place very interesting and there isn't a huge amount of interesting information. Personally, I wouldn't bother with this one as it is a little over hyped!",
          "The aquarium is small but entertaining in a small town. Grab a spot for the sea lion feeding early- this is very popular.",
          "Good aquarium. Small but you can feel really close to the seals. The feeding and training exercises are nice and the animals looked good. Easy to see and fun",
          "Came here on a Saturday when it was snowing hard outside. It was packed with lots of local families. The guy on the cash desk told us that there was a film show in 10 minutes but it turned out to be 40 minutes. It was about Svalbard and ok. We could not get near the seal",
          "It's basically a museum with a nice film of Spitzbergen, four seals in an aquarium, some other fish and some explanations on the flora and fauna. Nice visit, if you have some free time.",
          "I thought seals had much more space but they are more like in a prison... luckily the guys working with them are nice and professional and the love them. 5 star for them!",
          "There are only 4 seals 2 x bearded seals and 2 x grey seals. The bearded seals are captive and have been there for about 14 years, if I remember the trainer correctly.",
          "I arrived just in time for the afternoon seal feeding and training where there were so many people it was difficult to see anything. They also have a panoramic theater where they show two different movies - one about the northern lights (this movie is also shown on a normal tv",
          "This was a good idea for a less active and more snowy sort of day. Information was clearly displayed in a variety of formats, including two short films about the flora and fauna of the area, and the Northern Lights. There were lots of aquatic tanks full of local fish, crabs,",
          "Interesting for me. There are some shows or wildlife, northern lights etc. and also aquariums and is also a museum. I loved the seals swimming above us at this walk thru tunnel. Definitely worth a visit. A cafe for u to rest and enjoy the blissful moment too.",
          "Polaria is a lovely small aquarium a short walk (10 mins) from the centre of Troms\u00f8. As well as a range of exhibits, the seal feeding is great fun to watch and the two short films are also interesting. Price not too bad by Norwegian standards. All in all a good way to spend a",
          "The seal feeding as well as the two short documentaries, especially the one on the Aurora Borealis was very good and enjoyable.",
          "if you have a couple of hours extra this museum is a good place to go. its takes about an hour to see the films shown, see the aquarium etc. if you want to, you can also have a cup of coffee. also nice shop. We bought 2 very nice Norwegian sweathers for our sons at reasonable",
          "great place to learn about the damage that ewe are doing to our environment in this part of the world, also has an aquarium with local species if fish and a seal pool",
          "This small museum offers an interesting view on climate change and how it affects the Arctic. They feed the four seals living there in front of the public which is fun. Children will enjoy this place.",
          "A beautifully laid out aquarium and museum with a strong environmental message. The kept animals (seals, fish, etc.) properly looked after and in appropriate space and, to cap it all, a strong message at the entrance about the plastic waste that litters the oceans with horrific",
          "This was a great way to spend the morning/early afternoon. It was about \u00a319 each to get in (Not bad for Norway). We got to see two videos- one out Northern Lights and one about Norway/Tromso. They had bearded seal time at 12.30pm where they fed and exercised the animals. They",
          "The tour of the Polaria Center started with films about the Northern Lights and Svalbard on a massive curved screen, the novel photography was excellent. A number of exhibits dealt with global warming, at the current rate the Arctic ice will disappear by 2040. There are a number",
          "The main attraction of Polaria is the bearded seals. The feeding time is the best part. The aquarium has exhibits of the most common species in the Barents Sea. In the Arctic Walkway, there are films and installations explaining the affects of global warming in the Arctic. In",
          "Stay for the seal feeding and the panoramic cinema videos!!! Worth a visit and easy to access. Great for kids and families.",
          "Small place to visit, and possibly over priced. But I think the seal feeding made the trip worth it. Other than that it includes a small aquarium and 2 short movies (which I felt weren't that informative) but a nice way to kill sometime while in the centre",
          "This very nicely set up museum about the North Pole which also includes an aquarium with 2 seals and 2 walruses. I was lucky to be there on time for feeding time in the morning. Very good for children, too, to learn about animals, plants and climate change of the North Pole.",
          "Watch some short movies about the northern light and Svalbard. See some fish and go to the seals-show. Fun for kids.",
          "Inevitably this far North brings horrible weather so Polaria is a good bet to spend a couple of hours indoors. Primarily it houses a small aquarium with lots of info on the importance of the marine environment & climate. There is a seal pool which is very popular at feeding",
          "They have seal feeding and training twice daily. They really are the stars of the whole aquarium and it was awesome seeing them up close and personal. The Aurora film was also great but they could definitely expand on the Arctic wildlife film. Their mission is to be an education",
          "There are two movies that they show, the Northern Lights and Artic wild live. When I was there they fed the seals which was really good. Lots of exhibits about the snow and also life under the sea.",
          "I guess its a good choice for people with children. There is an aquarium with some fish and seals. The cinema room offers a short 5 mins movie about Northern Lights. The same movie you will find on YouTube. I would save that money for some good norwegian meal.",
          "Worth a visit to see the building, if little else. The gift shop is as large as the museum. The seals were entertaining though, although costs a fair bit for what you get back!",
          "You begin with a 20 minute video on the northern lights which isn\u2019t too scientific but is informative. Then there is a 20 minute show in which trained seals are fed. You also can see the seals in underground glass encased pool area.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. It was well laid out. The films on northern lights and artic animals were so interesting and amazing to watch. Well worth watching. Loved watching the seals being fed and watching them swim around. Perfect museum for any age. I loved it.",
          "but good experience. The seal training was fun and cute. Not pricey, so a fun place to go with kids. Didn't take long, but I didn't expect a huge all day aquarium. I knew what ti as going to be and because of that, not let down.",
          "This is a very small aquarium. The movie shown helps you spend some time in the aquarium. The seals were fun to watch. But you can go through the entire aquarium in under an hour.",
          "What a nice facility! Watching the seals was fantastic, they play with you and are a sight to see. The movie is good and the souvenir shop has good stuff.",
          "We visited polaria on our free day in Troms\u00f8, it is great for kids and those interested in checking out aquariums. The seal feeding time is worth going for but it's definitely underwhelming. There are a couple of films shown that are worth a watch! Probably best to go around",

          "Was visited to look round . Their is a film to watch if you wish to do so ,if not you can walk round at your own speed . Their are some very good displays of fish, with very good lighting. Sadly the seals didn\u2019t have any outside areas to play . We didn\u2019t visit the cafe , but",
          "Great for children to see seals being fed. Tourist shop selling lots of Norwegian souvenirs. Informative Movies to watch",
          "My family and I visited this attraction and we were very happy with our experience. The panaramic video was the highlight of our trip as the video took us around the drastic senary of Tromso\u2019s mountains. The seals were also very impressive.",

          "Nice museum with marine animals from the arctic water. It is really informative with a lot focus on how to treat the oceans. They have one big tank with seals which and they do a great job to keep the animals stimulated. It was a bit shame with a big buss of german turists who",
          "There are two films which last approximately 15 minutes one on arctic wildlife and the other on the northern lights. They are shown alternatively on the hour or half past the hour. The exhibition introduces you to arctic wildlife and there is seal feeding at 12.30 or 3.30pm. Get",
          "The building itself looks interesting and there is a fairly nice selection of items to buy in the shop. The museum itself is small but has a seal pool.",
          "We had some downtime on our weekend in Tromso, and decided to pop in to the Polaria. There wasn't a lot to see other than the seals - which were quite active and impressive. High price for a limited experience, but if you're really stuck for something to do it wasn't bad.",
          "A really interesting place, seemed to be a combination of an aquarium and a polar museum. Stunning film about the Svalbard islands and bearded seals in a really nicely kept enclosure with a great viewing tunnel.",

          "I checked out Polaria on my first night of arrival in Tromso. It was a 10-15 minute walk (there was ice on some streets so I\u2019d say it was a cautious and slow 10-15 min walk) from Radisson Blu Hotel, which served as a good introductory walk-though of the city. The short version",
          "Polaria is a museum well located in Tromso and quite new. Video film could be better displayed but is worth it (Svalvard film). Afterwards there is a \u201cshow\u201d/training with seals. There are also some local animals and species.",

          "Great architecture, and a very interesting place. Two fascinating films to tachometer, one about the arctic regions and the other on the northern lights. The seal pool is great as is all the science associated with climate change and the decrease in the polar ice caps",
          "This is a good little aquarium and the seal feeding was worth seeing. It is small, and not particularly exciting. I'm glad we went. If we hadn't made it, though, I don't think we would have missed much. Really cute gift shop.",
          "We got there in time to catch feeding time for the seals, they have 2 types, bearded and harbour seals. Super cute watching them play in the water, fetching balls and being mentally stimulated, you can tell that the staff really care about them. As well as the seals there are",

          "Decided to visit and give the aquarium a visit. Great fun with lots to see and informative for both adults and children. If you have some time free, this is a great thing to do in Tromso.",
          "This is not a big museum. It was pretty quiet when we were there. I can imagine it full of school children. I appreciated the two films, and we loved meeting the seals. Great gift shop.",
          "Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. But this place gives you a good insight into the effect of global warming on the polar ice And the work which the Norwegians are doing to preserve the natural wildlife. Very interesting installations with seals and other sea life Worth a visit",
          "Spent an hour here and really enjoyed hearing more about the Arctic and Northern lights. Loved the displays and lovely little gift shop!",
          "Fantastic experience reached just in time for the feeding of the seals. Small but very nice and the 2 movies of the northern lights and the animals and birds in the north of Norway it was spectacular.loved the Polaria amazing",
          "The seals have been trained and perform some amazing tricks, but this is not just for the benefit of tourists - it's to keep them active mentally and physically. There are also some interesting fish and other sea life. Excellent gift shop and a cafe upstairs.",
          "Aquarium is a small part of the building, quite a few video arena areas and mock up of ship you can see next door. Most popular part of the visit is the seal enclosure which you can view above and below water level in tunnels.",
          "Really enjoyed a visit here with my daughter. We loved the seals feeding time and learnt a lot about them from the staff. The panoramic film on Svalbard was a nice way to relax and just watch the beautiful scenery. The staff were really friendly.",
          "Great place to get an understanding of the Arctic environment and make sure you wait around for the seal feeding - very entertaining",
          "I really enjoy Polaria. It is well laid out and full of interesting exhibits. It is easy to get too. I love learning about The Arctic! The gift shop has good quality nice gifts. Staff are helpful (even when I just popped in to find out about buses!). Finally it is excellent",
          "A fun place to visit for an hour or two. The touch pool is great fun and the film on Svalbard is also good. The best part is the excellent shop and coffee shop.",
          "If you need an activity for bad weather, Polaria is a good choise. Before you enter the aquarium itself, you have the possibility to see 2 movies in their panoramic cinema. There are a lot of information next to the aquariums, and if you are there at the right time you can watch",
          "We visited in an afternoon after returning from a trip. You only need an hour or so as it is quite small. 2 good films one showing nature in the area and one on the northern lights. Interesting displays on global warming and plastic pollution - the ecological ethos here seeming",
          "I visited Polaria today to kill some time before my flight on my final day in Troms\u00f8. Overall it is very informative about animals that live around the arctic regions of Norway and there is some fish and seals to see. The seals are fed at 12:30 and it is lots of fun to watch,",
          "We came here before we caught the flight back to the UK. It is not a big museum, but I found it interesting all the same with information on the ice cap and it's shrinkage and Svalbard and it's wildlife. The aquarium was really good with different arctic sealife, but yes, the",
          "We squeezed our little trip to the Polaria in the end of one day. It's quite a small museum with not much to see. If you've got kids or you want to see the feeding of the seals, then plan your trip around that, otherwise there isn't a whole lot else to see. They show two films:",
          "We visited one morning when we had a few hours to spare. The cost to get in doesn't seem expensive (you'd pat similar in the UK), however it is pretty small and there isn't a huge amount to see. We probably spent about an hour in there. The seals are fed at 12.30pm which was the",
          "Polaria is not a regular aquarium as it has a limited number of fish or sea life, only those from the Arctic, but it has two bearded seals from Svalbard and two harbour seals. They show two films, one on the Arctic (Svalbard and Spitsbergen), the other the Northern Lights...it",
          "Short walk from the city centre. We really enjoyed the seal feeding activity and the staff stayed around after to answer any questions we had about the seals. Would definitely recommend!",
          "We went to Polaria on 26th December and kids loved the seals feeding activity. Rest of acquirium was tiny. Northern Lights + Svalbard shows were ok.",

          "Some informative areas relating to the area and history. Seal feeding twice a day was disappointing as we expected more \u2018acts\u2019 from the seals. Plans to expand the seal area. We watched films on the northern lights and local wildlife on the large screens. Cafevhad basic range.",
          "The main attraction here is the seal feeding and a mini-theater showing the sun rays. Took us just 30 mins to explore the whole place.",
          "It has good educational value for children. We came for the seals show and we're disappointed. Some exhibits were interesting. Overall opinion - can be skipped.",
          "The seals are adorable. This is a tiny aquarium that can be enjoyed in an hour or two. The best part is the seal feeding. They are so cute and fun to watch!!",
          "We are in 2017 !!!! The old days where it was acceptable to see few seals jumping and playing for food in a very small pool are over ! We felt embarrassed hearing that there was no bigger pool for the 4 seals. How is this possible ? In Norway ? The country always so proud of its",
          "An amazing place to visit, very nice to see the bearded seals and listen to how they survive in the wild. Can highly recommend going here to visit",
          "Cute plac; many fish and seals, seals feeding twice a day, a great panoramic \u201ccinema\u201d inside. Great place to be with family (especially with kids), it\u2019s nothing special but worth a visit if you\u2019re cold outside.",
          "This is part of the artc research centre and well worth a visit to find out more sbout the natural side of northern Norway. Dont miss the large screen films and feeding the seals.",
          "Polaria is not to be missed. Interesting local exhibits on Arctic marine life and the northern lights, plus SEALS!",
          "This is worth visiting if you are in Tromso. Don\u2019t miss the seal feeding sessions! Look out for some great hand made memorabilia in the gift shop from seal fur and moose skin.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for families with teens. They were bored & the entrance fee did not justify the visit.",
          "Really Nice to see arctic animals. Especially recommended to families with children and you can learn a lot What is Northern Lights",
          "This is a nice place to your kids if you are passing by Troms\u00f8 and the weather is not so great and you to avoid shopping malls or Leo's crazyland. Definetly a much better option.",
          "Lovely hour spent with my son, watching the seals being fed and learning about the attic. Very informative. Warm instead so you can hang you coats up",
          "The visit to Polaria was very interesting, and I really appreciated the seal feeding, aquarium and the theater. It was worth a visit, though the museum was extra tiny, so I recommend staying for less then an hour.",
          "An interesting place to go, for sure, but not very big and not a huge amount to see. It is worth watching their movie clip about Spitsbergen.",
          "a science museum in Tromso, with live seals and arctic sea aquarium. there was screening of northern lights. it's located in 10~15 min walk from the hotel we stayed. next to this interesting domino chain Polaria building is the seal hunting ship Polistjerna(?) museet that was",
          "The place is quite small, but their films on the northern lights and the happy seals and info on the decreasing icecap are worth it.",

          "Amazing selection of various sealife not normally seen in an aquarium. Underwater walkway and bubble sections were fantastic, to be able to see the sealife more closely and feel closer to the seals. The seals seemed very well looked after and very happy, we were pleased to see",
          "Very interesting trip here but brief. Expected more content, more detail, although what they did share was interesting. Video needed a voice over to bring it to life. Deals were cool of course.",
          "I confess I was expecting more about this one. It's more an aquarium than a museum. If you are hanging around the city I would tell you to go, but don't block your day just to go there. There's something really neat about them, they feed the animals twice a day and you can watch",
          "My daughter and I visited with friends whilst on holiday. It was lovely to see the seals being fed and then to walk around looking at the other fish, etc. The videos were brilliant, particularly the Arctic Wildlife one, where you feel as if you are flying over the scenery,",
          "Smaller than expected but what was there was worth the visit. The northern lights video and the seal show was worth it.",
          "We visited this quite small museum/aquarium in November. There are some very interesting fish and an area where you can be in a tunnel watching the 4 seals swim. Enough to see for about 2 hours. We did not see the seals being fed but others enjoyed doing this around midday.",

          "The aquarium is small, but they have many interesting things! I got to see fish I've never been able to see before. All their animals are arctic so it's cool to see that. Also had interesting videos. A little old, but by no means rundown.",
          "The polaria is only small but it is has some very interesting areas, it\u2019s good to see the polaria are working to inform visitors about global warming and the effect of plastic on the oceans. It\u2019ll be nice to see the bearded seals again when they get their new home - eventually.",
          "It's worth walking over to this place to see the building, and it's worth going in for the seals. There's also some cool and weird sea life to look at. But overall it's small and doesn't take long to see everything. Nice gift shop though!",
          "So informative and really well displayed. Nice shop with lots of nice gifts. Great visit, you will not be disappointed.",
          "Nice little aquarium. Interesting range of sea life but the seals are the stars. Couple of interesting films about the Northern Lights and Svalbard. Good little cafe.",

          "This attraction gives very interesting insight into the fish and mammals which inhibits Norway. The most interesting part of the place was the seal enclosure. The feeding time was entertaining and educational. The seals looked really happy and well taken care of. I spent around",

This Patrick air museum is popular with children and families as it\u2019s an aquarium with lots of cool displays. It\u2019s small, and you feel a bit ripped off as a result. But this is Troms\u00f8, and there\u2019s not a",

          "Polaria, designed like cascading blocks of ice, offers the perfect introduction to aquatic life in the Arctic Circle. We loved the touch pool - anemones + star fish - plus the informative display on global warming. Scary. But the bearded seals were the stars of our visit. They",

These seals are so much fun to visit with and the trainers that work with these seals are incredibly friendly and will answer all of your questions! You should not leave Troms\u00f8 with out stopping to visit the seals and the other",
          "We just wandered into this aquarium without planning to, and it was an excellent few hours. We got to watch the seal feeding and training, see the arctic fish being fed, and just had a great time walking around and watching the film about Svalbard. Think its meant for kids but",

          "The majority of Polaria is an aquarium housing 2 harbour seals and 2 bearded seals. There are attempts to stop the seals getting bored, but I'm really unsure as to the quality of their life. There are also smaller aquaria with wolf fish, crabs, skate, anemones and other",
          "This was educational as well as fun and my 4 hours just sped past. Definately see the seal show, it was very entertaining. The film at the beginning is very interesting and its amazing how the landscape has changed so much!! I thoroughly enjoyed my time here.",

          "Polaria is the northern most aquarium in the world. It's in Troms\u00f8 , Norway. Built with beautiful architecture. Inside which you will find a shop with products like jackets, mugs  , souvenirs etc .Here you can get information about the \u2026",
          "A very small place and not very special and fascinating. The only thing which was amazing was seal which make a very little show by their instructors every hour, plus a cinema inside which mostly show advertisement instead of entertaining \u2026",
          "Small but nice little aquarium/ arctic fact museum. The 4 seals are adorable and the staff caring for them are wonderful and will answer any question! Great visit when exploring the city centre",
          "Fantastic experience, very helpful staff (particularly when helping with my mother who has mobility issues). The seals they have there are the star attraction, especially if your lucky enough to see them during feeding time. The rest of the \u2026",
          "Easy place to reach, and friendly, helpful staff. No notices though about times for the different films. Seal pool was great, watched them training and feeding with commentary.  Very little else though, through the aquarium,  not like the sea life centres in uk. Cafe lovely, food good range and tasty, but no notice of closing times .",
          "Pretty disappointing. The aquarium is actually very small and doesn\u2019t offer a lot of variety on species\nnor information. It looks much bigger and more impressive on the outside, because only a small part is open yet! The entrance area and \u2026",
          "Beautiful aquarium with seal feeding and aquatic animal world. A cinema shows once again in panoramic view the nature of Norway. But the whole museum is small. Those who want to have a break can do this in the cafe. Here you have to dig deep into your pocket for a small piece of cake.",
          "Very cozy place to enjoy arctic nature. We saw the feeding of the seals and the guide answered all our questions. The seals are very playful! Nice experience for both adults and children.",
          "A nice & cute aquarium. You can see a number of sea animals. The best show comes from a group of deals. A must see in Tromso. It opens up to 1800hrs.",
          "Interesting marine centre in the city of Tr\u00f6mso in Norway. Interesting northern lights movie in the wide screen cinema takes 5 or so minutes. Seal feeding and training was on at 12.30 and again later in the day. That was great, the seals were loving it! Well worth a visit, staff very nice too.",
          "I cannot recommend this place highly enough!! I've never seen so many interesting quirks in a relatively confined space. The exhibition Pr(ICE)less reminds us of the growing global warming and the melting ice in the Arctic, while other \u2026",
          "My son and I spent several hours exploring all the displays and facilities here in December 2019. With a strong focus on the the Arctic environment and climate change, we found the presentations very educational.",
          "We liked it very much but the Aquarium where the seals are we found a bit too small.\nThere is a lot of information about the Arktis and the clima and the animals there and it is interactive what we liked much.\nThere is also an small indoor playground and a very nice Cafe which you can sit for a while having a cup of Coffee.",
          "Small and cozy aquarium. With a nice and \"hard\" exposition regarding the pollution of the seas/world!\nThere are several fishes but the mail attraction would be the seals; which are feed at 12:30 and 15:00.\nThere also exists a cinema where several films are protected about the northern lights, evolution...",
          "Great place to visit - seal training is really good and the trainers really happy to answer questions. Good size too - not too big or small. A lot of information in English.",
          "Small and cozy aquarium that provides a lot of information on aquatic life and arctic.There exists a cinema where several films are projected in a panaromic view  about the northern lights, arctic life. They have a seal feeding. Here you have to dig deep into your pocket for a small piece of cake.One can spend an hour here.",
          "Fabulous building and by Troms\u00f8 standards, relatively inexpensive. But I was a little disappointed by what's inside. You could be thought it all in under 20mins. \nIt seems wrong to keep seals in captivity in a place like this too. Other \u2026",
          "VERY TINY aquarium. The 4 seals were most entertaining. Go at feeding time. Otherwise you just watch them swim around in their small tank. \nOther reason for going, stay outside for the exterior view of the building, which is quite interesting, like fallen books or slices of bread.",
          "Polaria is a small but well kept Aquarium focusing on the local marine life. The Seals are the Stars of the show (feeding is daily at 12.30 at the time of writing), but there are  interesting Fish and other animals as well.",
          "The main attraction are the bearded seals. Try and time your visit with the training and feeding. Could be fun for kids. Would recommend if you have nothing else to do in Troms\u00f8.",
          "Nice place you can learn a lot about global warming it's amazing how the culture cares about its animals nice aquariums great place for children and adult to learn about sea life",
          "Small but nicely maintained. Must see it\u2019s main attraction it\u2019s Seals",
          "Not very big. Don't waste your time. Go see the natural beauties of troms\u00f8 itself.",
          "Meh. It\u2019s not really the kind of aquarium i had in mind. It\u2019s pretty small and there\u2019s barely any fish or sea life to look at. The seal feeding was enjoyable, although short. I like that they mentioned the fact that they have activities with the seals to keep them mentally engaged and not for the public\u2019s sake.",
          "Not just an aquarium, but the public outreach arm of the nearby research institute. Spoke to a passionate and well-informed Masters student who was part of the training demonstration who had some very interesting things to say. Met Mai-san, \u2026",
          "This is a great place to spend an hour or so.  They do a nice show with the bearded seal and harbor seal feeding. They also have a cool video about the Aurora Borealis. Also, kid friendly.",
          "It was very cool learning about the sea life and seeing how the seals train! The design of the aquarium is also very interesting.",
          "It's just that, ok. Very small and some of the animal enclosures are cramped. But the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely try to go while they are feeding the seals. It was the most interesting part.",
          "Very good museum with lots of information around polar ice and going warming and how it impacts everyone. The Seals were quite active and healthy and a joy to watch.",
          "Watched the seal feeding at 15.30 after watching the 14 min movie about the wilderness in Svalbard was really nice",
          "Good place to spend some time here and see how the arctic sea nature goes on. Watching the Feeding to the seals was good also.",
          "It's a very small place but worth a visit if you have the time and are in the area. Don't miss the seal feeding and training, otherwise I'd say it isn't really worth the entry fee. We were lucky to have turned up exactly 8 mins before it started! Nice little souvenir shop too.",
          "Nice aquarium and cool to see the sea life. We stayed for the seals feeding which was cool. We spent 1hr here, I think it was enough. If you have children there is lots to do here.",
          "I loved the seals, they were very playful and active!",
          "Love it!!!!! We saw feeding and exercise time and even have a chance to play with seals!! Amazing place to spend time",
          "Wonderful litte Aquarium.",
          "It's very small, there isn't a whole lot to see, the seals are great, the cinema room very good and the topics interesting, but just over an hour will see it covered.",
          "Not an awful lot to see, some fish looked dead and really hungry, coffee shop was nice",
          "Very expensive for what is being offered. The \u201cpanoramic\u201d movie is very outdated and the screens are unfazed and old... the museum is small and not Updated in the last years...the only thing I thought is worth it are the seals, that are adorable.",
          "Learnt about northern lights. Enjoyed seals. Could be a bit more educational and tell you about the fish and wildlife in the area.",
          "You can watch the documentary film about artic animal and enjoy seel breakfast.",
          "The seals are so playful and the up close view of the artic fish was very informative.",
          "Smaller than I thought, but the seal training and feeding was worth it, also the videos of svalbard and northern lights were nice",
          "Small but nice to visit of you have a spare morning/afternoon",
          "IT is a small akvarium, where you can see artic spieces, living inn the North  Sea. Seals Are really fun to watch.",
          "Very nice and interesting acquarium with different kinds of sea animals. There is also a little cinema showing some documentaries, in addition there is a seal pool with 4 cuties inside: i suggest to go there when the seal are fed so you can \u2026",
          "Worth visiting, get up close to the seals",
          "Slightly expensive for what it is. Beware of the panoramic cinema if you suffer from any balance problems.  I had to keep my eyes shut after 4 minutes  as it brought on my vertigo.  Still worth a visit though.",
          "Interesting to see some of the sea life from the arctic waters up close. Nice cafe.",
          "Polaria Museum is one of the sightseeing places in Troms\u00f8. We watched a few polar creatures (too bad no polar bear there) and we met the playful seals during their feeding time. Meeting Mai San was a highlight.",
          "Modern building... Didn't have time to visit when I was there. Only saw it from outside.",
          "Great museum! It there you can see several artic  animals, such as seals. Also there is an interesting exposition about plastic pollution",
          "lovely place in all its sense, just that car parked outside in front of the building all the time that spoils the view and the photos.",
          "The aquarium is big and has many various kinds of fish. There are seals, as well. Great place for kids. There is also a panoramic documentary show for northern lights for almost 5minutes inside the theatre. However, for such a small place, the price is 150Nok per person.",
          "Nice aquarium with bearded seals, panoramatic cinema, worth seeing",
          "A fabulous little place in Tromso, where you learn all about the arctic marine life in the area, and the resident 4 seals!",
          "It is a bit small, but the shows in the panoramic theater are great, and the seals are so fun to watch. The staff is also incredible",
          "I was bitterly disappointed. The (small) exhibition seemed tired and outdated in many areas. But the worst part is that 4 adult seals share a very small uninteresting pool. This area is way too small for them, and not a ray of sunlight has \u2026",
          "A wonderful place to experience arctic wild life live.",
          "Not so big aquarium but worth a visit for spending few hrs in a day. Seal feeding show not to be missed. Few short movies are played at regular interval in the theater.",
          "Worth a visit there is a cinema presentation plus live aquarium educational displays worth checking out the feeding times not a show for the sealions souvenir shop is expensive",
          "Polaria is an Arctic aquarium. The main attraction of this place are the seals. There are 2 public feedings a day, at 12:30 and at 15:30. During this the 2 arctic seals and 2 harbour seals are fed and do some exercises for mental \u2026",
          "Loved the seal feeding. Not much to see other than that. But a nice experience overall",
          "Went for the seal show but the whole aquarium was pretty cool! Quite small so not suitable for a full day trip",
          "Very interesting the nature documentaries about Svalbard islands and the northen lights... But few Animals in a Small Place...",
          "What a great place to visit while in troms\u00f8 with friendly staff!",
          "Great conservation messages but they really need to improve on the aquarium aspects.",
          "Has seal feeding / show, small acquarium and selection  mini-movies - we saw a Northern lights and Svalbard movie (maybe 15/20 mins each). Super friendly staff and nice to visit when the weather is bad.",
          "It is a good entry point for a vacation in Troms\u00f8. You will learn a bit about the northern lights and the Arctic environment and also how it is threathened today. It is enriched by an animal exhibition. You will see live fishes and also 4 \u2026",
          "Our visit to Polaria was a mixed experience. Films were ok, and the place has some interesting things. The best part was the feeding and training of the seals, the highlight of the place.",
          "Nice acquarium and seal flock. Great with kids too!",
          "Small but cool aquarium. Should come to see the seal at 12:30pm and the two films about Svalbard and the Northern lights being shown in half hour intervals.",
          "We got to watch two films here. One was explaining the origin of northern lights in a very scientific manner. Quite elaborate and provided good knowledge. Second one was even better. It had an excellent audio visual know-how of birds and \u2026",
          "Overpriced and outdated. They have some seals... and a panoramic movie. That's all. It simply doesn't worth the money you'll spend. Save your money and go somewhere else.",
          "With potencial to grow as one of the main attractions of the city.",
          "Nice place for both adults and children. The seal feeding is a good experience.",
          "I had a great visit and met loving and caring people who are taking care of all living animals there. And a nice shop too!",
          "Really cool aquarium with a lot to learn.",
          "A beautiful well maintained aquarium. Nice to see all the marine life in big tanks. Has everything from seaweed to seals. I\u2019ve enjoyed the northern light show. First time got the opportunity to see the seals and how they are trained to act during the feeding time. Intelligent animals. Wonderful staffs and guardians of these fish.",
          "Nice museum. Could spend more time here",
          "Its nice though would be nicer if the attraction has more sea animals to showcase",
          "The seal feeding/training was the obvious highlight. \n\nGreat place to spend a few hours especially if you have children.",
          "It's a very nice place. Should come before 12 or before 3 to see the seal feeding and training session. Sea creatures are majestic here.",
          "Really interesting museum and beautiful acquarium!",
          "The museum was very fun, especially the seals!\n\nIt would be better if they had added some more information about the marine animals because at some moments it felt like I was walking in Sealife",
          "Seals feeding show was nice to see.",
          "Not much to see, however they've got the bearded seals with origins from that place. Definitely noteworthy architecture however",
          "Small but lots of information. Seals were amazing.",
          "Limited exhibitions but the deals 2 are cool.",
          "Nice object, unfortunately only accessible between mid of June and mid of August.. ;-/",
          "Great attraction, not so long, but I had a great time learning about the local glaciers and the animals too",
          "Educational trip. Learnt quite a lot going here.",
          "Interesting, less on the inside than the size of the building would indicate but the seal and fish are worth seeing.",
          "Very nice museum and a great gift shop. The design of the building is absolutely amazing and you would not know it from the outside that it would seem so large in the inside. The staff is always friendly, but if you are not from Norway, the prices can seem very high especially if you are there paying for family and children.",
          "The seals were great!",
          "Worth a visit. Makes you think about polar life and our climate changing as well as plastic",
          "Very interesting and worth a visit",
          "My son and I visited in June 2019 and had a great time! The movie about the northern lights gave us a little taste of what we were missing some we were here during the summer. The seals were fun and the staff was so respectful and helpful. Recommended for anyone visiting Troms\u00f8.",
          "Nice museum. The building is old and needs renovation.\n\nThere is a nice playground inside which has a crazy steep slide. \n\nThe coffee and the waffles were terrible but still ridiculously expensive.",
          "Interesting place to visit with a short film and seals in a pool doing tricks. Plenty of information and a very interesting display about plastics in the sea... Very topical at the moment and really well done.\n\nFor me, apart from the film \u2026",
          "Nice aquarium in such a small space",
          "Super place, informative, educationa. A great aquarium with Walruses and Sealions....lots of other exhibits and some interaction     items for the kids. Your start off with 2 films in the theatre regarding the Northern lights and a birds \u2026",
          "This is a very short visit, and decor and movies seem a bit outdated. Nonetheless, staff was very nice and I really enjoyed watching the seals.",
          "A very welcoming staff and a different way to feel and learn about the disaster of global warming.",
          "The panoramicmovie was a bid disappointing because it was really old and there where only images and movies without telling a story. The other part of the expo was really small. I think Polarianeeds an update...",
          "The only bright side are seal family...It totally not worth to get here..",
          "Greate Place <3",
          "It offers some short films about northern lights, svalbard etc and one can watch the sea lions. They also do a short show where they feed them and do some training and tricks. Interesting specially for children. Entrance is a little expensive but I can imagine that keeping the sea lions can cost a lot.",
          "Great Seal feeding!",
          "It is interesting when it comes to marine life but quite small in size so besides the cinema and the seal aquarium there is not very much to see. Make sure you check the feeding time of the seals, because that is the most interesting activity. The design of the building is also quite nice.",
          "I really loved the diversity of marine life. The aquaria seem to be well maintained but the seal basin was not really enriched so I don't think the seals are too happy in there. They don't get to see daylight either because their enclosure is inside. The informational films in the panoramic theatre were informative and fun to watch.",
          "Brilliant lovely place, cracking little aquarium",
          "Lots of fun and student discount helped save us some $$ in entrance.",
          "Interesting place to visit But I worry about the quality of life for the seals as the appear to live an entirely indoor life!",
          "I enjoyed an hour and a half here. Good info and seals. Great for kids and the seals a sweet.",
          "Poor animals. I hope the new building, that is being built next to it, will offer a better life for still captured creatures. The only interesting and nice attractions were the films and the starfish. Also I appreciate the info on plastic in oceans, though it could have been more.",
          "Educating but aside from that a waste of time.",
          "A sea dog show is in fact the time of their food after they have won the fish in exchange for the one who played the throw and catch.  I would have added a star if the ticket cost was half",
          "Cool but a bit small",
          "Small aquarium with seals. I timed it right and got to see the feeding.",
          "It pains me to give an aquarium a low rating, but it is a bit of a let down. It only takes an hour or so to move through it. Catch a few films, they are produced pretty well. Catch the seal show. It isn't too involved compared to literally \u2026",
          "It's a small place but worth visiting.",
          "The seal show was cute but the whole place is tiny and overpriced for what it is",
          "A very impressing complex, showing very much about flora and fauna in the region north of the polar circle in a amazing arrangement, I learned a couple of things from my visit there...",
          "A bit small but very good.",
          "Tickets is too expensive for a single seal but yeah it is norway. there is environmental awareness  data and events which is good.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit. At last a proper explanation with an animation of what exactly the aurora borealis actually is! The seals were adorable and so was the trainer lol. He was keen to answer all my questions and is clearly passionate \u2026",
          "Polaria is outdated. Photos of decreasing ice dated 2009. There is nothing about what we as a world should know and do about it. The film must be at least 20 years old (so is the big screen). This place needs an update. Now. Friendly staff and a lovely store by the entrance though.",
          "Nice cinema but s very short film. A bit biased information regarding Climate change. Friendly staff",
          "Fantastic experience, amazing exhibition, marvellous cinema.",
          "Nice place to see nordic ocean life. There are seals, fishes and plants. The movies are a must see. It is how ever a little expencive. Polaria has bin the same for over 10 years. Wish they could \"fresh it up\" a little.",
          "Lovely little aquarium.",
          "Good fun for the kids. Multimedia entertainment. Live animals, seals. Some fish and crabs. Good souvenir shop and cafe",
          "Great views around the harbour, wonderful photo opportunities",
          "I'm struggling to review this place, it's almost 4 stars, but the lack of content makes it a 3 star attraction. If you do go, get there when they are feeding the seals - looking at fish only lasts for so long.",
          "Best \ud83d\udcaf %",
          "Nice movie of northern lights. Live fishes and seals on exhibition.",
          "Very small, not really worth it",
          "small, so not much walking, and many cool exhibitions too",
          "We just enjoyed the feeding of the seals. they are so cute. the films about arctic circle are very nice. The building is really an architectural delight.",
          "Cute place with seal feedings. But very small",
          "Excellent and wide range knowledge. Very nice.",
          "Excellent it had a aquatic zoo housing animals like seals and other fish found in waters near tromso. Rare animals which are difficult to see in India or other zoos. Plus they have a movie showcasing Svalbard and arctic region and brief history really unique and inspiring. I really cherish the momentsspent here",
          "Worth a visit. Interesting films behind the science of the Northern Lights, plus a good deal show. Also has a mini-Sea Life Aqurium too",
          "Amazing place for recognizing and enjoying arctic nature",
          "Super little museum!! I mostly visited the aquarium, where they were feeding the seals!! So cool!! And loads of other fish and sea life!! Not too expensive for what you get and the shop is amazing",
          "Nice and educative place for adults and kids alike.",
          "Very small aquarium, and we payed 200kr for 2 people which isn't too bad. The tanks seemed a little small for the fish.\n\nMake sure you go at either 1230 or 1530 for the seal feed and training as it's definitely the best bit.",
          "Otherwise great but the seals seem to suffer in the pool that is too small for such intelligent animals",
          "Nice place to get familiar with the arctic marine life, very informative and interesting!",
          "Small, but the price is fair for the size. I wanted more, but it was still fun",
          "Very great place about Oceanlife, Science and more. We loved the 3 seals, but felt very sorry, that their aquarium was so small",
          "Cute seals \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Nice place.",
          "Nice little museum dedicated to the artic",
          "Polaria museum is good and we can see how  Norway old generation  are living in NORWAY \nCity is clean and silent....",
          "Seals are the best\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Nothing special... just one aquarium with 4 seals from many angles and aproximately 10minutes movite about Troms\u00f6. One little playground for children. \n\nEverything takes about 40minutes",
          "Amazing Arctic aquarium!! Turned up just in time to see the seals being fed and trained / played with! The host was very informative through the show and stayed after with us for lots of questions and answers about the seals we were \u2026",
          "Very nice place for children and adults. You can see the only two bearded seals living in captivity. Be sure to come while feeding to see seal training",
          "The sea lions were amazing",
          "This is a great place to bring your kids or just go for a couple of hours as a tourist to gain knowledge about the Arctic.\nShort Educational movies are shown about the Arctic and Northern lights. The aquarium is filled with a variety of \u2026",
          "So many cute animals! There are also corals you can touch.",
          "Very small aquarium & theater.",
          "Great museum. They show 2 short but interesting movies. One about Spitsbergen and one about polar light (aurora borealis).\nThe seal aquarium is superb, you walk under the seals who swim above you. The seal show is nice. You see how they \u2026",
          "The seal feeding and training session is interesting to watch. It's clever how you can walk under the seal aquarium",
          "Every polar bear lover should visit and support!!! Proud to be part of the first cypriots to join!!!",
          "The view of the seals arr great, many windows that go into the pool giving a great view. The panorama cinema was also great.",
          "Nice place to visit in Troms\u00f8. It is a small aquarium with a shop in the entrance. There is a nice ship inside a building close to the main building. The aquarium is very small, but interesting to visit. There is also a tank with four seals and an incredible panoramic cinema.",
          "Have been first time in place like that. Wonderful!",
          "Cute seals",
          "A small but interesting place to visit.",
          "Nice and informative but I expected  the place to be larger. Some aquariums, seal basin, and video of the northern lights and the North Sea. Very interesting building looking like collapsed white domino pieces.",
          "Great hairy seals.",
          "Very nice  animals. It is small  but there is allot of content. You can watch a film and there is a feeding time for the seals. \n\n10 out of 10 would polaris again",
          "Interresting",
          "Having been to the Monterey Bay CA Aquarium many times, I went in somewhat sceptical.   I am happy to report I was pleased. The seals were neat and they had a few unique exhibits.  It was well worth the time to visit.",
          "Beautiful place and seals are fun to watch. There are also very good quality short movies which you can watch about Arctic beauties. However I find it overpriced for what they offer. I hope it goes for seal food and some research purposes. Overall worth to spend some time there.",
          "Small and nothing special for the price. Not worth your time if you have ever been to a zoo. Gift shop with decent but expensive selection.",
          "Better than expected. Staff very friendly  and informative, give a lot of info about local wildlife and artic area. Well worth a visit.",
          "Small but extremely interesting",
          "What a great aquarium! Very much enjoyed viewing the life in the tanks.",
          "It a fantastic place for the hole family, it's fun, educational, clean and you can relax in the cafe. The staff is going out of their way to help guests. \nA good choice for a half day trip",
          "It's good for a day out, but not very big.",
          "The museum itself is interesting - Small but well done. They had two short free video showings: one on the northern lights which included a short explanation of the phenomenon and various landscapes with the Northern Lights over Norway and \u2026",
          "Highly recommend the hotdog, the seal feeding was cute!",
          "Great! We arrived just before they fed furseals which was a great show. I also learned about plastic recycling initiative and touched an anemone \ud83d\ude0d\nA tone of positive emotions, if you like nature.",
          "It's okay. There's some interesting information about the impact if plastic etc on the world's oceans. The aquarium is fine but the seal tank is too small for the poor seals I think :(\nThe Arctic wilderness and northern lights films were really good though. It's a good place to amuse yourself for an hour or so.",
          "Two stars for the idea but nothing special and quite small",
          "Very nice to understand recycle plastics to save globel climate change and animals",
          "Very nice  eqvarium for children",
          "The good - The seals are amazing and the staff highly informative and enthusic about their work. The bad - all the poor reviews are right this place is tiny and apart from the seals a complete waste of money. My advice only go if you really like seals ....but they are pretty cute.",
          "Really nice people. We watched 2 shorts film and saw the seals playing with the trainers. Nice and interesting. Got discounts with our students card.....actually all the places have students discounts and are very accessible.",
          "Absolutely brilliant. So much to see and do. Really interesting.",
          "Just about okay. The place is VERY small, with just a few views. The main attraction is feeding of the seals. If this was not on schedule when I visited I would have been furious at the ticket price.",
          "A pretty small aquarium with the main attractions being the seel feeding which I guess was ok but the area they were in felt too small. The 2 films shown were pretty underwhelming where one was essentially pictures for 20 minutes. I reckon this would be ok for families but not much else.",
          "Lots of fun. A bit small compared with the other corporate places in US but fun enough for my kids.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit. Nice videos and pictures. Some show with the animals!!! There are 2 parkings one is free after certain hours. That's the one in front.",
          "Best highlight were the seals.. The exhibition itself is a bit little and poor.",
          "Very interesting information through videos and displays. Also their cute harbour and bearded seals!!",
          "Small place with great documentaries about northen lights and Svalbard islands. The seals are the main attraction and the are so cute and funny!",
          "Although the gift shop is lovely and some of the exhibits are informative, the enclosure for the 4 seals is too small and sterile, I felt sorry for them and regretted funding the place. It was a bit small with not a lot to look at, considering the cost of entry.",
          "Should be more attractive it's not everything they can offer.",
          "A very informative movie about auroras, plus a seal pool and selfie passage.",
          "The two movies on Svalbard and the Northern Lights were amazing",
          "Small place with just a few tanks, over all ok.",
          "This aquarium is designed more with children in mind. Very kid friendly/kid accessable. Perhaps not worth it if you are visiting as an adult. However, the seal exhibit was very cool. They are beautiful animals and it was fun to see the staff feed and train them",
          "The seals live in a pool that's way too small. So sad.",
          "The seals were very cute, and the exercises they did with feeding them were really awesome.",
          "The Aquarium is a bit small. I expected a bit more for this price. The movies were good. The staff was very friendly.",
          "The entry fee is quite reasonable although the exhibition is quite small. The entry fee includes access to the exhibits, two short educational films, and watching the seals being fed. The cafe is great and offers drinks and snacks for very reasonable prices. A great venue for a family trip, lots of fun for children.",
          "Small but interesting museum displacing the Fauna and Flora under water, under the ice. Probably takes 20mins to get through, highlights are the seal feeding and films in the panorama cinema.",
          "Well worth going to see the seals being fed",
          "There is a movie theater with interesting films about Spitzbergen and the Northern lights. A small play area for kids and a small area about the problem of plastics in the oceans. Some aquariums and a seal feeding. Although the seals are \u2026",
          "A museum on Arctic environment, about Life their with main focus on animals/birds of the region there. A reasonable good show put up by the authorities, though the ticket price is high. Staff is courteous. Display of limited version of \u2026",
          "Very nice place for visit",
          "Interesting film(s) northern light and svalbard. Some nice aquarium with arctic / deep sea fish. And seals. Good cup of coffee in the restaurant as well.",
          "Absolutely great even for smaller kids.",
          "Very good aquarium, with interactive exhibits",
          "Really fun place to go if ur a tourist, not really a place I'd go. Good for children and adults",
          "Great place to spend a morning and have a little lunch. Some fantastic films shown throughout the day and interesting staff to chat about creatures and environments. Loved it",
          "The efforts against climate change and  plastic pollution have been greatly appreciated.",
          "Small museum but a really nice experience",
          "Loved the seals and the Arctic experience",
          "Smaller than I had hoped for but enjoyable",
          "Really interesting place to visit, loved the Svalbard film.",
          "Very good, next time I would love to try ride the boat simulator",
          "Very nice! And the seals are very well trained \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "Nothing much to see. The seal tank was verry dirty and small compared to other aquarium i have visited. I was expecting something much more than the different architecture of the building",
          "Nice little aquarium tucked in the arctic. Got a nice gift store too. We were disappointed since the old ship museum connected to it was closed for public..however open for tourist buses",
          "We really enjoyed visiting the seals at Polaria! If you're in Troms\u00f8 this is one of the places you should see.",
          "Though it's a small aquarium, it's peculiarity is the seals",
          "Very nice place to visit with children especially when you arrive just on time where they train and feed the seals! There are also things to buy as souvenirs!",
          "It's beautiful! Do watch the panorama movies.",
          "Lovely place, I was so excited seeing all those beautiful buildings.",
          "Very nice. The seal tank could have been a bit bigger for the seals.",
          "Focus more on their seal. Overall time well spent here.",
          "A small aquarium with very limited species. The only attraction is seals and feeding at 12.30 and 15.30 pm.",
          "It's a nice aquarium with good displays, but not a huge variety. Pretty confusing layout. The fish are lovely (and sometimes creepy). Seal feeding is nice to watch too.",
          "It was very small, as others have said, but that's quite good in a way. Seals feeding was decent but get there at least 15minutes before the show starts or you won't see much. The building itself is a huge draw, and it's perfect for filling a couple of hours. ",
          "Interesting experience. Well laud out with informative films and good displays. Nice aquarium and photo opportunities with seals etc.",
          "Nice little polar animal museum, more for children seal feeding was cool",
          "Small, but cute. Seal feeding is very popular",
          "Cool location, lots of tanks with fish and seals",
          "Good seal feeding show. Some monster Atlantic Wolf Fish. Could do with a big tank with North Atlantic fish though.",
          "It's time to CLEAN the Oceans!! Nice theater with informative movies and some cute shows.",
          "Enjoyable, especially when you go there with the kids",
          "Wow seals! Great Norwegian seals. No bull shut just the facts. Amazing display. Tak Erirk and Mrs. Trainer you guys are AWESOME! Sponsor a seal and enjoy the amazing behind the scenes tour. Our favourite in Nordnorge.",
          "One star for the funny building (from outside) and the good intention. One star for the souvenir shop which takes up half the building. Old, tiny, boring, poor seals in a bathtub, way overpriced (130nok per person).",
          "Really nice place to visit in the beautiful Troms\u00f8.\nThere is a small theater with a movie about the arctic sea and an aquarium.",
          "We liked Polaria, but I think is a little pricy. They have a cinema where they play movies about the Norway and the Northern Lights, a sea lions exhibit (feeding timw at 3pm), and other exhibits about the wild life in the area. \nI would say that you can see the whole place in about 1.5 hours.",
          "Good place for kids. Fun if you come for the seal feeding around noon.",
          "Quite expensive for what little there is to see.\nSeal feeding is almost impossible to see unless you manage to get right to the front at busy times and tours do occur.",
          "nice place and they have souvenir shop",
          "museum of flora and fauna of the Arctic sea. done very well and sensitive to environmental issues. pass by here!",
          "Awesome  experience",
          "Great experience, good bang for your buck",
          "Very interesting place to visit",
          "Small aquarium housing a couple of seals. Informative.",
          "Nice place, but not very big. The exterior suggests something more then the interior offers. The exhibitions are fun, but the whole experience doesn't last long. Feels like it was mostly designed for kids. ",
          "The two films we watched were super. The seals were great.   Very informative and enjoyable. Staff very helpful.\nLoved it!",
          "Great place small but interesting and worth a visit",
          "Nice experience. Loved the seals.",
          "Very tasty and big",
          "Great museum with nice attractions and a touch pool for some see animals. The seals are a attraction, too. \nOnly the Souvenir store has nothing polaria exclusive which is a bit sad for collector.",
          "Most enjoyable",
          "I loved it! Eneryone is kind and everything is perfect! I wish I could go again soon!",
          "If you have children this is a must see due to the 4 live seals in the seal pool. You can get pretty close to the seals which is a fun experience. Other than the seals, I did not find the Polaria to be that great.",
          "Very interesting place. Feeding and training show made my day.",
          "Its amaizing. Everybody visiting Tromso shuld see this",
          "Very moderate interest. Small and pricey for the 20mn that you can spend there. Maybe better impression from children",
          "Upset to find live seals swimming in a small swimming pool. Not convinced it is for environmental reasons as opposed to cynical commercial purposes.",
          "Interesting",
          "It was really beautiful and a cool experience but Polaria, itself, was smaller than expected.",
          "Very small. Huge gift shop. Seals were best and main and really only attraction. Max 1 hour stay is likely.\n\nSeal trainers were so dedicated. ",
          "Our daughter really enjoyed the little kids play area. Afterwards we walked through the aquarium exhibits, saw a presentation on the northern lights, and finished up with performance of seals doing tricks and stunts at their feeding time. Well worth while with children for a few hours.",
          "4 seals of 2 different species in a tiny pool ? No explanation of the research they are conducting on these seals. They seem to be just here as a tourist attraction. Pathetic. #endcaptivity",
          "Good for an hour or so, but not enough to occupy a full day. The seal show is a real highlight so best to find out what times the show will happen on the day you visit.",
          "Small aquarium with a couple of neat exhibits. Would definitely recommend making it to one of the feedings of the seals",
          "Perfect for families with young children.",
          "Like most of Tromso, Polaris is likeable and  modest. Good intro films and the main attraction is the small aquarium and seal pool. Go at feeding time to see the seals perform. Open on Sundays, unlike most of Tromso! Good value by Norwegian standards.",
          "If you don't have a lot of time this a great place to go there's a couple of films to see one on the northern lights and the other is a bird's eye view of the north of Norway o and the sea life center as well takes about 2_3hours",
          "Great place to visit to see the sea life in the Artic Norway - the seal show is great.",
          "Educational and very immersive.",
          "Super fun. The seals are awesome to watch and you can talk to them",
          "Great place to visit on a Sunday when the shops are closed. Beautiful seals and great sea creatures.",
          "Really informative",
          "Well worth a look, especially the seal feeding",
          "Okay-ish place. You can see some fish and the seals are quite funny to watch during the show, but it\u2018s nothing special. They have a small exhibition where you can learn something about the Arktic region. If you have one hour to spend, give it a try. I can imagine that younger children would love this place, though.",
          "The film at panoramic cinema was really interesting and makes want to see the nordic nature even more. The seal training and feeding was a bit overcrowded, but nevertheless a visit is definitely recommended whenever in Tromso, also for children.",
          "It was ok. The best part was the feeding of the seals.",
          "Small yet educational!\nIf you have kids or children, this place would be a great place to go. Try to go around 315 or 330 for the feeding.",
          "Good place for family",
          "Good experience but rather limited for the price.",
          "It was excellent,, excellent  , lovely people explaining, information.\nI love Troms\u00f6, but it's expensive.\u2665\ufe0f",
          "Absolutely loved this place. Don't expect an aquarium - this is as much about the panoramic films and educational videos as the live animals, though they are captivating. Spent a wonderful and memorable couple of hours here, and would return if revisiting Troms\u00f8.",
          "It is the most north aquarium in europe. I liked it and my son liked it. It is worth visiting. A few minutes walk from the center entry fee not to high. The seal training dissapointed a little, but what can you do. Good time with family.",
          "Absolute must! Fantastic aquarium with a great variety of animals - fish, penguins, otter, seal and more",
          "Awesome! Great set up!",
          "This is actually really upsetting. First of all, the pool was extreemly small. Both for the seals and the fish. I would not recomend anybody to go here! Second of all, the information about the sea cretures and their natural habitants was non existing and the few information screens was out of order or malfunctioning.",
          "Good place, nice info, interesting experience",
          "Very nice architecture. Haven't been inside.",
          "Great place but a little to small for the seals",
          "They keep the seals in a really smal pool",
          "Very good presentation, great looking seals, we learn new things about nordic animal life and love panorama cinema movie about northern lights.",
          "beautiful sea creatures",
          "There is a feeding section. A little bit fun. \nBut the area of Polaria is quite small.\nThere is a restaurant selling food and drink.\nNice taste",
          "Not the best price/quality ratio but you can learn something about artic animals. Very nice feeding and teaching seals moment",
          "Best time to visit is just before the seal feeding time at 1230 and 1530. The seal feeding and training is followed by 2 shows at 1300 and 1330. You'd probably spend another 30 minutes seeing the other exhibits. The bearded seal is only found in the arctic and hard to find elsewhere. ",
          "The seals are super fun to watch. I had one jump out and bump my hand. Wish i had a fish for them. The staff are absolutely very helpful when booking adventures.",
          "Nice exhibitions, although showing the seals in the aquarium was very depressing.",
          "A very informative and enjoyable visit",
          "Small aquirium with lots of different sea life and a wonderful movie about the aurora",
          "A must visit in Tromso. A cool place with a lot of sea animals and seal feeding games every noon. It provides a lot of information about the area around Tromso, as well as about the Arctic in general. I loved the movie that explained the Northern Lights!)",
          "Awesome experience especially cinematic show",
          "For young and old",
          "Very nice place!",
          "Love the architecture of the building, try to arrive when they are training the seals.",
          "Not a lot to see and a bit confusing. The seal were impressing, though.",
          "Terrible. Don\u2019t go. Depressing, bit run down and expensive.",
          "got to see the bearded seal feeding",
          "10 points\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude42\ud83c\udf40\u2764",

          "Polaris movie is great.",
          "really nice especially for tourists",
          "An educational system for the nature of polar bears and seals.",
          "Not really good. We expected it to be more informative. The two movies are OK, but not spectacular. The whole place makes an old impression.",
          "No other way to put it other than an AWESOME museum!  The building is designed to look like shoved ice.  Such a cool museum with a lot of great subject matter.",
          "I wanted to rate 5 for all their movies, but really sad herevis only few fish and super cute seal. There is no other type of arctic animal.",
          "Mostly seals, but fun ones! Ship was closed",
          "Really cute seals and some good information about the oceans and global warming",
          "I recommend the other museums in town. The building from outside is nice but in the end the inner values count. ",
          "I enjoyed my visit here and found it informative and interesting. The kids liked it too. ",
          "Northern most aquarium in the Arctic cirle",
          "Amazing place to visit in Troms\u00f8.",
          "A small decent aquarium where you can spend 2-3 hours. Nothing very great about it. The seal feeding show was also OKish.\nI didn't find the value for money, but everything in Norway is expensive.",
          "Amazing",
          "Very interesting",
          "Nice place with cool seal shows and things to see. Recommended visit",

          "Bad acquarium, with few pools. Also the seal pool had a very dirty water",

          "Awesome place to be. Unique specific to Artic wildlife",
          "Quite interesting and enjoyed watching the seals. Limited exhibits though and could do with an update/makeover!",

          "Small aquarium, best attraction by far is the seal pool.",
          "Very small not that good compared to uk aquariums",
          "Nice, though a bit pricey place!",
          "Small selection of tanks, which were also small and bare. Panorama movie was nice to look at, but had very little educational value. You have seen the entire place in less than an hour. ",
          "Very pleasant to see seals so close  , I spent 2 hours watching them. A small place, but it is worth it -\nTicket fare: 125 Kr \nThe museum Shop has interesting items And Sami stuff ",

          "Verry beautiful!\u2764",
          "Very interesting museum, also from a scientific point of view. There is a cinema with a film every half an hour that is included in the ticket. There is also a small cafeteria there.",
          "Missed out on the northern lights and Svalbard?  Pop into Polaris and see two excellent short films highlighting both.  Stay for the seals!  ",
          "It's a more impressive piece of architecture than a museum, but it passed the time okay.",
          "The architecture is really nice outside!\nIt's the northern most aquarium of the world, but you know, maybe it's nice for kids",
          "Wonderful movoes and Animals!!!",

          "Nice place for 1 hour or more visit",

          "Nicely maintained aquarium ...pool and tunnel where seals are kept are just amazing",

          "They have a nice movie of the Northern Lights, a small museum, and a mediocre seal show.  They do have a bearded seal and you can see the seals swimming in the aquarium.",
          "Small place and quite expensive, in addition to that some equipment were out of order(simulator). There was a place for children where they could draw but not one piece of paper was to find and 90% of crayons broken. I had impression that the seal aquarium was never cleaned....",
          "I am against zoos and aquaria in general, but decided to give this one a shot out of pure boredom. The idea seemed nice, an aquarium dedicated to arctic species. Had I known they keep 4 seals in a pool that would be too small for even one, \u2026",
          "Its Ok. The seal training was brilliant and definitely a highlight! Its a small aquarium that you could probably walk around in 10 minutes however there are quite a few distractions mostly in the way of taxidermied animals and skeletons to \u2026",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Finnish: Tromssa; Kven: Tromssa; Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a city in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  The city is the administrative centre of the municipality as well as the administrative centre of Troms county.  The Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland and its Bishop are based at the Troms\u00f8 Cathedral in the city.  The city is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya which sits in the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait, just off the mainland of Northern Norway.  The mainland suburb of Tromsdalen is connected to the city centre on Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel.  The suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya is connected to the city centre by the Sandnessund Bridge.\n\nThe 21.25-square-kilometre (5,250-acre) town has a population (2017) of 64,448 which gives the town a population density of 3,033 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,860/sq mi).  The city centre (on Troms\u00f8ya) has a population of 38,980.  The mainland borough of the city, Tromsdalen, has a population of 16,787 and the suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya has a population of 8,681. The most populous town north of Troms\u00f8 in Norway is Alta, with a population of 15,094 (2017), making Troms\u00f8 a very large city for this vast rural northern part of Norway.   It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). \nThe city's largest workplaces are the University of Troms\u00f8 (UiT) and University Hospital of North Norway. The Norwegian Polar Institute also has its headquarters in Troms\u00f8. The Northern Lights Observatory was established in 1928, and two companies affiliated with the Kongsberg Gruppen collect satellite data from space using the observatory. The fishing industry is very important. Norway's Norges R\u00e5fisklag and Norges sj\u00f8matr\u00e5d (seafood council) both have their headquarters in Troms\u00f8. Sparebanken Nord-Norge also has its headquarters in the city. Furthermore, \"Skatt nord\", an agency of the Norwegian Tax Administration is based here too.\nThe city is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from the word for \"island\" (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The Arctic cathedral is stunning by day or night - we made it a point of visiting at both times, since this building is so unique. We paid the entrance fee to go in for 30 minutes or so, take pictures and soak in the beauty. It\u2019s absolutely worth a visit!",
          "This beautiful Church is especially nice at night, when it is lit up and the stained glass windows in the back show up really nice. I know the architect didn't like the addition of the stained glass windows but it is really beautiful at night with the light showing through",
          "Nothing is impossible even we are different religion. Very speechless to see the art of engraving inside the church.",
          "Everything about the church is stunning from its triangular shape, its stain glass windows and its huge organ. We were told the stain glass had to be replaced because the previous one was in yellow glass and the churchgoers had to wear sunglasses when they attended their",
          "Unique architecture provides an overwhelming sense of tranquility and peace. Windows were magnificent and we could only wonder about how beautiful it would be at night fully illuminated. While a small cathedral it was very impressive.",
          "This place is near to the bridge and beatiful when snow cover the place. At night me and my wife can here the church singing with snow fall at the background...i really love the place and will come back to tromso one day",
          "The design of the cathedral is very interesting and stands out from the view. We made the walk across the bridge to get here. We captured quite a lot of photos near and far for remembrance.",
          "We drove there and took picture from the outside, many tourist came as the design is very special. It was a shame that we can't go in there.",
          "This cathedral with its stained glass windows is beautiful. We were fortunate to visit when a musical group was practicing which gave us an idea of the exceptional acoustics. There is a small gift shop near the entrance that has some really nice postcards of the cathedral under",
          "We took bus 26 from the cable car station and dropped off outside the Arctic Cathedral in the day. There was a charge of 50 NOK per pax to enter the church, which you can glance into through the glass facade. I overheard a fellow traveler's query, where the admission charges has",
          "This is a very modern built cathedral and looks better far away than up close. Design good but material are relatively common. 50kr for adults to enter and there are some post cards , books and magnets to purchase. Toilets are down stairs. Look back at the church organ up on the",
          "If you are in Tromso be sure to visit the Arctic Cathedral. You can view the cathedral from the downtown area in Tromso and if the light is cooperative the view is stunning. You also get some great views of the cathedral as you walk over the Tromso Bridge. Inside of the",
          "We went to the Midnight Concert here on 20th September & it was amazing! It\u2019s a beautiful building, the acoustics are great & the music superb. A 45 minute concert with an organist/pianist, a flutist & a soprano playing & singing a mixture of Norwegian/Sami classical & folk",
          "Visiting the Arctic Cathedral in Troms\u00f8 should be on everyones Bucket List. We visited while on a Hurtigruten voyage & absolutely loved it. The stain glass window is amazing, but the acoustics are incredible. If you can, go to a Midnight Concert. You will never forget it. We",
          "I attended yesterday, mainly to have a quite moment with the Man Above.. I was horrified that the cost, to pray, was 50nok. NO exceptions for children or seniors. Not only was, is there NO information about the cathedral, it's history, what they do currently, NOTHING! It",
          "Loved to see it! So interesting not only outside, but inside too. We found inside some rehearsal of songs for a weding. Very intersting, white, a lot of light and the glass wall amazing. A must see in Tromso!",
          "The modern architecture looking from outside and the painted glass inside is so different to the traditional church. It looks more like an exhibition piece fir modern artists.the metal work within is also so different and modern. A must visit for all.",
          "This is worth a visit if you are in the area. The architecture, the stained glass, and the organ shape are all modern, clean lines. We were fortunate that the muscians were practising for an upcoming concert. If you can, visit for a concert.",
          "A spectacular design and prime location make this church a prominent building in central Tromso and a building that has rapidly become one of the symbols of Tromso. Also called Tromsdalen Church, this parish church is part of the Church of Norway, although it is not a cathedral.",
          "A modern cathedral design that attracts both young and old because of the large mosaic and the localization. Take the bus - the bridge is not healthy to walk on.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful in spite of many visitors. I always find it strange to pay to visit a church, but it was worth it.",
          "Included on most city tours the Artic Cathedral is definitely worth a visit. Across the bridge from the town it makes for a nice photograph from the harbour. Inside it is very modern with clean lines, impressive accoustics and a large beautiful stained glass window. They hold",
          "When you imagine a church you think at something old. It is completely different, modern and very interesting construction. But pay to enter in a church, even this, is unacceptable",
          "I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. The church overlooks the town and is impressive on the hill and can be seen from all over but inside it is just average. There was a big organ that someone was playing but I was disappointed there just wasn't more to this",
          "This striking building dominates the skyline of Tromso, more so because it is in a residential area and on a ridge overlooking the harbour. The architecture is the attraction and the story of it's construction is very interesting. it is an absolute must-do if in Tromso, in fact",
          "One of the places to visit in Tromso, especially due to the exterior somewhat resembling Sydney Opera House, but underwhelming in the interior compared to most European churches. Cost was about $6 per adult with no senior discounts available. Credit cards taken. No brochure",
          "Our visit to the Arctic Cathedral was near midnight on a long frigid arctic night. Had it been just to see the building, I would have been disappointed. The word Cathedral does not have the same significance in the Norwegian Church that it holds for Catholic or Anglican",
          "Great place and ici, look at it from the outside. Nothing much to see in and pricey to go in. Great views from outside.",
          "This cathedral is nice on the outside, especially with the midnight sun shining on the front. However, the inside is cold and unwelcoming. It doesn't have the warmness of other cathedrals and maybe is a little too 'modern'. We went to a Midnight Sun Concert which was 200NOK. The",
          "The artic cathedral is one of the iconic sights from the harbour, perhaps 30minute walk from town. It is small in size, but the colours of the light entering the cathedral are wonderful, excellent location to view the main road bridge and harbour, also right next to the cable",
          "This stunning white cathedral is definitely the most beautiful thing to see in Troms\u00f8. It\u2019s also very hard to miss, as it sits on a rise at the mainland end of the Troms\u00f8 bridge. As beautiful as it is on the outside, the stained glass window inside is even more beautiful. Even",
          "One of the iconic landmark of Tromso, a must photograph structure with a beautiful modern Scandinavian design. I was photographing it twice, both day and night but in my personal opinion night time will give you a splendid result. It was in December and the city was covered by",
          "A modern building it looks spectacular from Tromso & the bridge. Not impressive from inside & definitely should not be charged an entrance fee.",
          "Located on the far side of the bridge into Tromso, it\u2019s a distinctive design. Worth a snap for any architecture fans.",
          "The simplicity of the architecture is the masterpiece - the stained glass reminds me of Klimt .Well worth a look inside .",
          "The Arctic Cathedral was an unexpected, dramatic sight against the dark background of a mountain ridge as our ship entered the harbor at Tromso. I took an easy bus ride from the ship to attend an afternoon organ concert. The hall has excellent acoustics. The organ is built in",
          "Interesting to see at night from afar. Not worth paying 50 nok to go inside. I wouldn\u2019t even make it a stop at all if it wasn\u2019t on the way to the cable car. There are magnificent churches all around the world for free - very disappointing.",
          "We walked on the bridge towards the Cathedral which offered a nice view. It was much more prettier from across the bridge and outside than inside. There was really nothing much to see inside and we felt the 50 NOK was too expensive and not worth paying.",
          "As others have said, from the outside this church is beautiful, a great spectacle and well worth seeing. The walk across the bridge is nice and seeing the church appear larger as you approach is amazing. However it is expensive to go inside ( 50 NOK , approx \u00a34.50) and we took",
          "I can't say i was that impressed with the cathedral itself ... I actually found the outside more interesting than the interior. Fortunately, I attended a spectacular concert that eliminated any negative feelings about the building itself. I wouldn't advice spending the time or",
          "This is one of the main attractions of Tromso but the architecture is great only if you look at it from outside. We stayed in the center of Tromso so we walked on the bridge which connects the Tromso island with the area where the cathedral and cable car are. We did not enter",
          "more than a cathedral. ..a little church compared to the churches in Italy ... nothing to see inside. ..and above all 5 euros thrown away ... makes the outside look better!",
          "I am sure there is a reason why the cathedral has only certain hours when is open, but that disappointed us. It would be nice if one could walk in, have a moment of silence and aknowledge the beauty we were entrusted on this Earth.",
          "Best to go here on the way to Fjellheisen as it is on the same bus route. It is also possible to walk from the city centre, but it will take around 20+ minutes and the wind can be quite strong while crossing the bridge. Need to pay if you want to go inside the cathedral itself.",
          "We have decided to see the cathedral before leaving, as it was a quick road from our accommodation - we did not regret! If you get to see it at night it is even better!",
          "We looked at it from the outside on our way back from the fjellheisen. It's nice and modern, but it looks more special from the distance at night/well, in the dark. To get in you have to pay, but I wouldn't know what for. You can see the windows through the window3s from the",
          "Cost 50k and small inside but very beautiful. A nice place to sit a while as warm no cafe but decent tolits.",
          "We joined the group from the Cruise liner Budicca and went to the Cathedral for a short operatic concert and of course to look at the Cathedral. The music was very good and singer was first class. The building itself is unique. Looks a like a toblerone chocolate. The",
          "Most impressive viewed from the outside and across the water. The stain glass window is striking but the rest of the Church is stark. I prefer the delightful wooden church in the city centre.",
          "beautiful stain glass windows ,lovely church,bit expensive to enter but glad we did ,looked lovely against the blue sky.",
          "If it hadn\u2019t been my 60th birthday, I might not have paid such a steep price (app. $50 for two tickets) for a concert that lasts just 30 minutes. But I wanted to end the day with something special, and this did turn out to be a lovely concert. An enchanting combination of",
          "The cathedral is quite nice but extremely underwhelming and, in my opinion, not worth the entrance fee if there is no concert going on. We went in, spent probably 10 minutes looking a the stained glass and then left.",
          "We visited here for the midnight concert arranged by hurtigruten, what a beautiful evening. It is an amazing structure being such an unusual shape, the acoustics are fantastic, perfect for the organist, pianist, saxophonist and singer to perform in. A great place to visit even",
          "I don't like churches where I have to pay an entry fee - and in this case we did pay. It was not worth paying 50 NOK to enter the church, you can see the altar through the window - you don't see much more when you are inside.",
          "Lovely Cathedral with a very impressive stained glass window. The Cathedral is spectacularly light up at night.",
          "This building is very iconic from outside, and it is really simple inside. It is nice to see and located in a great place, with nice views over Troms\u00f8. Worth the visit for the views, maybe not for the building itself",
          "Beautiful building and fun to take pictures of the outside. Inside looking quite boring through the glass, but I was quickly told that I had to pay the entrance fee if I wanted to take pictures of the inside, with a long lecture about that I should have known as it is clearly",
          "Very unusual and striking cathedral... but would not pay to go. I was hoping there would be more information about the cathedral but I didn't find anything. Very modern and minimalistic, not much to see. Was in and out in 5 minutes pretty much.",
          "Visited during city tour of Tromso with Hurtigruten Cruise. Beautiful from a distance, and surrounded by snow, just after sunset. Views across to the city spectacular. Lovely West End stained glass window. Better from the outside, than the interior",
          "50 nok to visit the church. Not worth the money to be honest , but beautiful architecture nonetheless . Tourist trap.",
          "I was there for listening the Norther lights concert. It was absolutely stunning. The place is so unique, quiet and simple but enlightened.I would definitely go again.",
          "Religion is supposed to be about faith, but when you have to pay 5\u20ac to pay your respects, the business underlying comes up. Half an hour walk over the bridge for this disappointment.",
          "Costs nk50 for 2 mins inside. Better off to just view from outside easy to walk from Troms\u00f8 20mins over the bridge",
          "A wonderful, modern building - its architecture reflecting modern Scandinavia and the surrounding landscape. Visited in the daytime AND at midnight for a concert. Fabulous!",
          "If most of Tromso is on the west side of the water, this is on the east of the water. I walked across the bridge in the pouring rain. it takes about 20 minutes from the centre of town to here Was it worth it? yes and no. Even from a distance, you can see it is a beautiful",
          "We walked across the bridge to see this cathedral but it was closed and not much to look at through the windows. Concert nights are held here but not worth a special trip to visit.",
          "Would not recommend this as a must. Looks way better from outside. Not worth paying for to enter. Could also be the lack of natural light.",
          "Nicknamed a cathedral, but it's actually a church - and a rather beautiful one at that. I loved the way the light enters through the side windows on even a dull day. NB costs to get in...",
          "Popular site, good to stop off for a few pictures after a walk across the bridge on the way to the cable car. We didn\u2019t go inside",
          "The Artic Cathedral is very easy to spot from Tromso and the locals were telling us about it saying it was worth a visit and it definitely was! It was really cheap to get in as it is a \u00a35 donation to go towards the up keep of the cathedral and the stain glass window, the organ",
          "Overlooking the bridge leading to the old town of Trams\u00f8 this beautiful church deserves a quaick visit if you walk to the Cable Car from the Troms\u00f8 Old Town.",
          "It's a different and nice cathedral. Good place to sit down for 15 minutes and discover details in the fantastic glass mosaic. One thing I would not do again is walk across the bridge. So much airpollution and noise. Take the bus back to town.",
          "It is well worth the approximately 1km walk over the bridge to visit the Arctic cathedral, a modern yet inspiring church, both inside and out, with the stain glass windows a particular feature. But perhaps the highlight is to attend a midnight concert. The timing is set to",
          "It is a modern piece of architecture inspired from the surrounding landscape. When we visited in winter it was snow covered everywhere so was postcard like beautiful. Interiors was expectedly modern. there is a small entry fee.",
          "There's is an entrance fee of 50NOK. Oslo city has great church and its free. If u are into church you may pay the money and look inside. There's window for u to see through also to see what's inside the church. Other than that its great to take pic from outside.",
          "This isn't really a cathedral, but is an interesting focal point for the community. All types of concerts are held there as well as meetings and such as well as church services regularly. The stained glass is quite beautiful.",
          "We would skip this one. Was not much to see. They charged to enter and it is really just a very average church.",
          "Beautiful architecture and very unique. Shame it was closed but nevertheless worth seeing it from the outside.",
          "This was the sole reason I paid huge sums of money to go on the Hurtigruten Tromso city tour; it was dark and there had been a heavy snow fall, so it seemed easier to be taken there in a bus. In all honesty, the 20 minutes we were allocated was plenty. It was so beautiful and",
          "Pay in entrance. Its enough to see it from the outside.. nothing special inside unless you wanna light a candle",
          "Looks pretty from the outside, short opening times and not a lot to do when inside. The architecture is stunning, it looks 100 times better at night due to being lit up, also a good view over the bridge to Tromso.",
          "Worshiper's get in free and the rest of us have to pay 50 NOK. Not worth the money. Looked through the window and made my way to the cable car.",
          "We were lucky enough to attend a midnight service at this cathedral. The acoustics and atmosphere were fantastic as we listened to Norwegian classical music and folk songs.",
          "Very nice hill side church great build and shall look good for day and night photos. Only find entrance fee is bit dear",
          "Not worth it to go in! Architecture amazing structure... Beautiful views from outside. Inside boring .. Not much else to say. Stained glass window only visible with colors from outside structure",
          "Located at the end of the bridge when you come from city center to the residential area, it\u2019s a wonderful construction that totally deserves some minutes to admire. On the other hand I could not say the same about the interior. Nothing special or on my taste.",
          "We walked to the cathedral feom downtown, over the bridge. The church is nice but having to pay to go inside was disappointing.",
          "Stunning landmark, do not miss. We walked across the bridge to see it up close and take photos from the outside. We weren't able to attend a concert inside cathedral during our visit, but I would definitely have done it if I'd known about the show in time.",
          "Visit to the Arctic Cathedral was a natural place of visit in Tromso. We took a 15-20 mins walk from the City Centre and crosses the bridge of Tromso. Arctic Cathedral is situated nearer to the residential part of Tromso. As Tromso is a small place, Arctic Cathedral became a",
          "We tried to visit during regular visit hours (13:00-18:00) but found 50 NOK entrance fee a bit too expensive.",
          "We actually went indoors during the day, but the best view is after dark when it's all lit up. A good stop on a walk back from the cable car towards Tromso.",
          "During our trip on the Hurtigruten ship Polarys one of the excursions was to a midnight concert at the Arctic Cathedral. This is a great chance to see this beautiful cathedral. The concert lasted 30 minutes with a soloist, saxophonist and a pianist. The acoustics are said to",
          "As per title . It's 50 kroner each to visit and really should be donation only . It's small ,for a cathedral, and quirky,but that's it .",
          "Waiting for 3 hours, nothing happened. We were cold and hungry, decided to give up. While we were waiting at the bus stop, kP index suddenly rise and some aurora explosion happened.",
          "It's architecture was quite impressive. Tall triangular structure, well constructed. It's on a height and the view from here is excellent. The bridge connecting Tromso Island and mainland looks quite excellent. Quite a photogenic spot and we clicked lots of photos here. On",
          "We visited during our 4 day break. It\u2019s a nice spot to see but costs 50nok to get in (c\u00a35) per person. It\u2019s a beautiful building but we didn\u2019t pay to go inside as you can see through the windows at the front.",
          "This is an icon of the city. Even if you stop by for a minute, it\u2019s a wonderful place to visit. Concerts inside. Check the local schedules.",
          "Such an amazing design. The stained glass window is just beautiful and the the building itself so worth visiting.",
          "One of the few actual \"sites\" in Tromso to see. It's a cool walk across the bridge from town and looks great in pictures and from the outside. Very small and not much to see other than the one big stained glass window inside. Really wasn't worth the cost of admission unless you",
          "Modern exterior and interior, little cold atmosphere but still nice to see since there is the only Cathedral built at this latitude (350km northern to Polar Circle)",
          "We walked across Troms\u00f8 bridge during the day to the Cathedral, we didn't go in at this point, but we did have tickets for a New Year's Eve concert, which we had purchased online about a month prior to going. The concert lasted approx. 1 hour and consisted of some Sami folk",
          "You have to pay to go inside, even as a student or resident. The outside is more interesting and the Troms\u00f8 Domkirke on the island is better inside for a more historical and religious vibe.",
          "We visited the cathedral on 23/12 . We were impressed by the look of the building and although the inside was stunning - there wasn\u2019t any information about the cathedral unless you purchased a book. But we had the good fortune to hear a Norwegian singer and his band warming up",
          "It is one of the postcards of the city and its simple modern architecture is so beautiful looking from far or near. The only disappointment I had, was because when I visited (on Christmas days) it was closed for visitation (which I understand as contraditorio).",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture. It is simple and elegant. Being the church once you are inside you can experience the serenity. Really great Stained Glass work",
          "On our first visit we only walked around the outside which is incredibly beautiful! But when we returned this year we managed to fit in a proper visit; and despite being busy, we still found the Arctic Cathedral to be a very peaceful place. There is a tranquility and beauty that",
          "Definitely worth a visit for the beautiful architecture. There was a minimal fee to go inside as well.",
          "Beautiful way to finish 2018 and get inspired to start 2019. This was the concert at the Cathedral. Arctic Cathedral is very interesting in Troms\u00f8. Modern and full of light.",
          "The design of the cathedral is just beautifulboth from the outside and inside as well. Check out the stained glass and walk all the way round. It's a great spot for taking photographs of Tromso and the fjords.",
          "It\u2019s a usual church. The outside structure is very unique for photos, but nothing else to see inside.",
          "The architecture of this church is quite unusual, and it has a nice lighting installation, as was noted by other people here. However, all of this is not that special and not really worth the walk, and especially not worth the entry fee.",
          "We went to cathedral ticket booth to peer inside and it didn't appear to be worth it. When discussing with the staff what there was to see, she suggested it would probably be worth it in the summer months but not during winter when there is no sun coming through the windows.",
          "Great architecture. The cathedral is next to the Tromso bridge, really a landmark.The inside is spectacular!",
          "Just like the title, one of the reasons we wanted to come and visit Tromso was because I really want to see this magnificent Arctic Cathedral. It is as beautiful as how it\u2019s photographed in the photos you probably see on the internet. Stunning.",
          "Interesting for architecture lovers and a beautiful subject from the outside for the photographers. We didn't got the chance to see the sun rises through the strained glass window but we found it beautifull anyway. Not much to doo but if you are lucky you can catch a Christmas",
          "When the cathedral is open, the lights are on and the huge stained glass window glows. That plus the architecture is what you\u2019ll most enjoy seeing. We paid the steep 5NOK to go inside and regretted that, though it was a donation to the church. I\u2019d suggest you skip that and just",
          "This is a pretty sight looking across the water from Tromso. Not sure it is worth the view up close, or going in. The hours for entry are also a bit unpredictable and don't necessarily match the website if booked for a private function.",
          "This wonderful unmistakable landmark of Tromso is located facing the sea and town centre. You can walk from the hurtigruten terminal and hotels across. It takes about 25 minutes to walk. The design is stunning. Open from 1400 to 1800 during winter with services behind held",
          "50 NRK for visiting the church. Watch it from the outside - there is NOTHING inside - you can't se through the windows. Best seen in the night - with the lights and and the beautiful windows at the back",
          "It's ok. A bit interesting, but nothing special. We didn't really get the chance to see the interior because there's a Sunday service going on and we couldn't wait since it was so cold outside. However, it is a great vantage point to take some photos and we were lucky the sky",
          "The cathedral is an amazing building situated at a quiet neighborhood just across the city center. We took the bus 28 thats two way return. There was a service going on so we didn't want to go in to disturb them. Took some nice pictures and the walked to the nearby cable car",
          "Took the 30 min walk in cold morning winter (minus 5 degree C) to enjoy the views and feel the winter of Troms\u00f8. Iconic Arctic Cathedral is good for pictures and also for taking the harbour and mountains. Great views but layer up as with the strong will temperatures will go",
          "I walked to the Chapel from the cruise ship area. I enjoyed walking over the bridge, but that might be too much for someone who is not used to walking or if you have limited time. There was an entrance fee. The cathedral is beautiful inside and out.",
          "As with most Scandinavian countries, I found this church to be a departure from the normal shape and architecture of the churches found elsewhere. Its located right at the end of the Tromso bridge and you get good views of the city as well the bridge from the church.",
          "Beautiful church, but you actually get the most out of your visit by an outside view. Might be otherwise in the summertime though, when you get light from the outside.",
          "This was a really beautiful experience. We attended the Arctic Cathedral Midnight Concert and it was wonderful. The cathedral has excellent acoustics and the singers performances were delightful. Would recommend anyone to make the effort to get to the concert. Well worth a visit.",
          "Easy to walk to across bridge from city centre. In winter it is lit up and looks outstanding against the darkness of the winter skies. Steep concrete sides are interleaved with glass panels bringing lots of light into the church and highlighting the beautiful stain glass window",
          "A wonderful musical experience at midnight. this beautiful warm modern cathedral has the most amazing acoustics, no microphones were needed at all.",
          "This icon of Troms\u00f8 is worth a visit. Walk across the bridge from the town centre, or ride a bus for a couple of stops. An active cultural venue, the church hosts hundreds of concerts each year. Its midnight concerts in the summer and northern light concerts in the winter are",
          "We were on the Hurtigruten tour and chose the option to attend a midnight concert in this very modern cathedral. The stained glass window over the altar is rich in colour and design. The concert was excellent. The performers (3) used the accoustics in a great manner,",
          "So we decided to walk to the Arctic Cathedral across the bridge, which should take about 20 mins but we probably took longer due to the awesome views we kept stopping to check out! The cathedral itself reminded me Toblerone, it was definitely unique in style and while simple on",
          "The 30 minute walk over the bridge to the arctic cathedral was totally worth it. You not only get amazing views of the city and cathedral from the bridge but also get to see a beautiful sky colors if timed well (we went around 11 am). The architecture is amazing. We didnt get to",
          "A must see iconic land mark of Tromso, a culture deeply religious (mostly protestant). I also highly recommend some education in relation to the Sami people.",
          "Firstly we never planned to visit the cathedral but happened to pass it on route to the cable car. From a distance the building looks impressive, even more so when lit up. As we walked across the bridge the church is directly in front of you. It is very easy to spot on the",
          "The church has a striking appearance from the outside however they charge 50kr pp for entry and it is deeply underwhelming. I\u2019m always against churches charging admission, but this one isn\u2019t even nice inside. Even the stained glass window on the back of the church was better",
          "We saw the cathedral when it was dark and that was 3pm in the afternoon. All lit up it on a hill,overlooking Troms\u00f8 looks pretty spectacular. The cost to go in was around 59nok. A modern church inside not a traditional one with statues of saints etc. Its fairly plain with what",
          "It's Lovely to see it at night, it's so shiny but we don't enter inside. Its a really nice views from there",
          "The cathedral is spectacular from the outside and when viewed from a distance lit up. The stained glass window is nice. However we didn\u2019t pay the 50NOK entry fee as you could see through the windows. Worth a visit but don\u2019t allow too long to see it.",
          "We walked from our hotel at Clarion hotel The edge to this Cathedral and it took around 30 minutes walking across the bridge. We thought it opens at 1 pm but when we arrived we discovered it opens at 2 pm in November. It looks modern and different.",
          "A modern cathedral, this is situated opposite the main town, you can walk across a bridge to get there or catch the bus - check the opening times though as they vary by season. The stained glass window is fantastic, the cathedral is quite minimalistic but is also very pretty",
          "We made a last minute choice to visit the cathedral for a midnight concert. The acoustics were amazing. What we could see if the architecture was interesting although we couldn\u2019t appreciate the huge stained glass window due to lack of light",
          "Apparently some dude recording a music video is more important than the dozens of tourists waiting outside in the cold. The exact length of the delay mentioned on the note was also very helpful.",
          "It's a very nice Cathedral, specially when the lights are turn on but there is still some mild sunshine that allows you to still see the landscape behind. On night time, even when you don't get to see the landscape, the view is still amazing. In all honesty, the exterior is much",
          "Cruise port of call. Beautiful architecture, couldn't see inside because there was a funeral taking place.",
          "It\u2019s a very beautiful Cathedral with modern architecture. It can be reached from the city center by walking or by taking a bus. Bus stop is just in front of the cathedral. For bus fare pp it was 50 kroner for 1&1/2 hrs, chk it with the bus driver once u get into the bus u can",
          "My partner and I visited the cathedral after seeing it all lit up from our hotel across the other side of the water. It's a really beautiful building from the outside and is designed to look like an iceberg which is pretty cool. It's 50 NOK each to enter but unfortunately when",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is an imposing landmark on the opposite side of the bridge to Tromso. We walked across the bridge on a very cold day but it was worth it for the views and for the church itself. There was a small charge to get in but it is worth it. If you are in Tromso",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is in Tromso Norway but on the opposite side of the bridge to town centre of Tromso. From the town centre of Tromso it is a spectacular walk across the Tromso bridge to the cathedral which sits at the foot of the mountains. The cathedral was built in 1965",
          "The church is very easy to find as it is located on a small hill overlooking the town. It's a very modern, large and open space.",
          "We first spotted this from the window in our hotel room. It was intriguing during the day with the exquisite stained glass windows, but when we viewed it up close shining at night it was more spectacular.",
          "This church is pretty but you don't stay long. If we hadn't got free entrance using out Tromso Pass I am not sure we would have made the trip but nonetheless it was nice to go.",
          "this is well worth seeing - it is a beautiful cathedral and/or church with lovely glass stained windows",
          "Striking building but probably more interesting from the outside than inside. There's a 50nok entry free",
          "You can see it afar from the city centre. Went closer, it looks the same except nearer. I guess it is the one of the landmark in Tromso. Chose not to go in as you can peep through the glasses.",
          "walked to the arctic cathedral but it was closed so i didn't manage to go in. i think it opens at ? 3pm only. anyway u can peer in their windows, nothing very spectacular. it's nice to take pix outside though! proceeded to the cable car station after this!",
          "My wife and I, along with my wife's parents, visited the Arctic Cathedral during our recent 2 night visit to Tromso. We walked across the bridge from downtown Tromso and the entire walk took us about 20-25 minutes on a clear but windy day. The walk itself isn't difficult but",
          "Picture prior to visit made it seem more then it is. Looks great from a distance at night. Not so much up close during the day. It what it is.",
          "I have given 1 for the stain glass window. Was it worth the 10 NOK to see it? No. Just a modern church inside which took me about 30 seconds to see. If I was a spiritual person maybe it would have been different but when I compare it to some of the magnificent cathedrals of",
          "A beautiful cathedral and well worth the viist. If it is not windy walk over the bridge from the city and this is an experience in itself and nice to arrive at the cathedral.",
          "It was a good walk from the Tromso island up the bridge and back. The cathedral is modern, different, serene and of course, has great views, from outside and within.",
          "My husband and I went here because I was interested to see the Cathedral up close. It was really nice from the outside. If you want to enter, you have to pay. We paid 100 (?) NOK for both of us if I remember correctly in order to enter. The inside was nice, but if you are not",
          "We were lucky enough to enjoy a midnight concert in the Arctic Cathederal in Tromso. Visually stunning building inside and out. We enjoyed perfect sound reverberating through the triangular structure. A male vocalist accompanied by a flute player and a pianist using his big",
          "Worth a quick visit to see the beautiful stained glass window behind the altar. Take the bus from the city centre and walk back across the bridge for a great view of the sound.",
          "Check timings before you go. We waited until they opened after doing the cable car tour. Once inside, you pay for admission and church is small enough to look around for no more than 1/2 hr, unless you wanted to stay longer for private prayers. I imagine would be spectacular if",
          "Interesting architecture but little else to recommend about a visit. Probably much better to visit for a concert or church services. A band was doing a sound check for a concert of Christmas music that evening while we were there, and the acoustics were impressive.",
          "It is a beautiful building and the organ plays wonderful music. Not really worth the price and not much to see inside. Would only do if the weather is bad outside.",
          "The trip across the river from the island to the church across that amazing bridge was as much a part of the journey The church was closed when we were there but hey, we took some cool photos of the church and the scenes from the bridge",
          "Worth a visit to this most Northern of churches. Beautiful setting overlooking the water. Highly recommended.",
          "We took a walk to see the Cathedral and it was closed the view was very nice from the front. Be sure to check ahead and see if the building is open before you go.",
          "It is a beautiful place of worship located at a nice location. Serene place to be one with yourself. Beautiful pictures of our mother Earth in the gallery.",
          "It was a beautiful sunny day perfect for a visit. We arrived just after a service (it looked like a baptism) with a young baby girl the centre of attention. The church is stunning outside as is the inside. Don\u2019t just look towards the alter turn back and look up and see one",
          "This is a beautiful modern cathedral with stunning architecture inside and out. We were particularly impressed with the huge, artistic stained glass.",
          "In Norwegian its called Ice Ocean Cathedral and of course with the shape and the surface of the building you know and feel you are in the Arctic! But, don't forget to take a peek - at least - inside and you will have a nice, warm and color adventures from the both ends (looking",
          "This is a beautiful building that you don't see every day, being a church and not being religious I did not want to spend the 50 nok requested to visit it, so I did look only the outside. The architecture is beautiful and particular, and it has been built on a nice view point in",
          "Cathedral is a strong word that evokes certain images in one's mind. This does not match those expectations, bit is still very nice. It's a simple construction, as often described, with nothing too notable about it. The stain glass added behind the altar was put in against the",
          "We visited the cathedral during the day and found it to be pretty and fairly simple compared to many European cathedrals. This may be in part to how far north it s (small population) and that the Germans burned a lot of N. Norway to the ground in 1944. Still it is a pretty",
          "Wife and I stopped by. They charge a fee of 50Kr which was a bit of a surprise. Decent crowd at 10 am",
          "Never experienced before, church charching an entry fee. Excellent location and looks beautiful from the other side in the evening light.",
          "You need to purchase a ticket to go inside.. The fee is about $6 US there is not much to see inside, only the chadelier which is like a large icicle and the stained glass. You can see it from the outside thru a window.",
          "From our Hurtigruten ship we took a bus to this lovely church to hear a midnight concert. It was worth staying up for.",
          "We only viewed it from the outside, as you had to pay to get in. The outside was beautiful, even in gray weather.",
          "Nothing about this cathedral is worth visiting, its literally one small hall and nothing special about the architecture or design. Just takes pictures from the outside that\u2019s probably all you need. Again, do not waste your money, the picture attached is all you gonna see inside",
          "Worth visiting because of its unusual triangular design and simplicity which makes it unexpectedly beautiful. A charming view of Tromso and the bridge leading to it from its elevated entrance.",
          "We had wanted to attend to attend the midnight sun concert but it was sold out so we just stoped by to see the inside. It is a simple church with interesting architecture and a beautiful stain-glass window. I do find it interesting that many of the Scandinavian churches charge",
          "The organ and violin performance makes the entrance fee worth the money. It was beautiful. If you don\u2019t like classical music. From the outside you can also make wonderful pictures. The architecture is interesting.",
          "I went to a midnight concert in this beautiful cathedral which was absolutely amazing and highly recommended. I walked across the bridge which seemed a really long walk and then the Arctic Cathedral appeared at the end of the bridge,surrounded by mist.",
          "Seems to be a constant stream of visitors walking over the bridge or being dropped off by coaches when the cruise ships are in. You get great views of tromso when walking over the bridge but I wouldn\u2019t waste your money to enter the cathedral. You can see what\u2019s inside by looking",
          "OK, the modern design when viewed across the water from the main part of Tromso City is quite eye catching and, as you approach it on foot, it stands out against the green background of the surrounding hills. However, internally it is a little underwhelming apart from the one",
          "A mid 20th century church with great vistas and a powerful modern organ. Unless you are interested in modern architecture it is probably not worth making a special trip to see the Church BUT if you can arrange your visit to coincide with the 14:00hrs daily organ recital it is",
          "We could see the Cathedral easily from Troms\u00f8, and resolved to visit it during our stay in Troms\u00f8. We walked across Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the view of the Cathedral close up was even more impressive. Although we didn't go inside the Cathedral (a Service was on at the time) we walked",
          "You need to visit Ishavskatedralen. It is an amazing building and why not attend the Sunday service. It is conducted in Norwegian but easy to follow and enjoy.",
          "Visited as part of Globus tour.Globus paid for us to see this??? Majority of group 42 passengers cannot understand what you pay for?",
          "Beautifully designed on the outside, and a little disappointing inside. The midnight concert was wonderful.",
          "It is nice. It is scenic. Nothing negative to say about it. But without the context of a church with modern architecture next to a beautiful waterway across from a glittering island city linked by a gracefully arched cantilever bridge, it might not quite rank in the top ten of",
          "The Artic Cathedral stands out among all the small houses nearby, close to the shore of the Tromso fjord. It is a modern church with a large white cross inside the tepee-like construction. As it is modern church the interior is austere, but the stained glass shines and brings",
          "Stopped to take a few photos of this beautiful, iconic church on our visit to Troms\u00f8 off a cruise ship. Just be careful if visiting on Sunday - the interior is closed to visitors on Sunday mornings for services, and is also sometimes closed on Sunday afternoons due to weddings.",
          "It's beautiful and when you think cathedral you think quiet, solemn-not here, not when I went. Was so crowded and chaotic. They have midnight concerts and that is probably nice I was really regretting not having stopped by before to avoid the crowd.",
          "Stands out from the distance and thats about it, expensive to enter and fairly plain inside. A lot of hype, not justified.",
          "Don\u2019t be fooled this is not an historic piece of architecture and history. Good views of the bridge and town. Inside is bland and the stained glass window saves it. Small hill to climb up and some stairs so if you have some mobility issues take care and check in advance. Our",
          "The church stands out as you view the town. The stained glass and architecture make it interesting to photo. l visited in the summer, but photos of the church with the Northern Lights are spectacular. I would definitely take the opportunity to visit If you are lucky enough to be",
          "This cathedral has interesting architecture and beautiful stained glass. If you aren\u2019t going to a concert or event, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to walk through and see everything there is to see. There is an admission fee.",
          "From our cruise ship we could see the Arctic Cathedral, architecture stunning on our trip up close just amazing. You must pay to enter 50 NOK per person I understand why BUT to pay to enter a house of God leaves me cold so I did not enter.",
          "This church, nicknamed \u201cIshavskatedralen\u201d (\"The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea\") is an amazing church. Despite the name cathedral, the church is a parish church and not, in fact, a cathedral as it is commonly called. A glass mosaic was added later, it was a wall on the place before.",
          "A small church with an interesting design. But not lots to see. Walk in, look around, look at the stained glass. That's about it. Nothing, frankly, to go out of your way for.",
          "If you arrive in Tromso via cruise ship, you'll easily recognize this prominent place of worship as it will stand out in your view of Tromso Sound. While viewing the outside of the Cathedral will give you a sense of the unique architecture, make sure you go inside to fully",
          "We were awed by the wonderful stain glass the architecture is incredible and the guide explained why it was designed with 11 arches to represent the disciples excluding Judas. It is quite expensive to go in but then everything in Norway costs more that in many more southerly",
          "We attended one of the midnight sun concerts. You can buy tickets there or online. The concert is about 30 minutes long and is wonderful. To get there from Tromso, we walked across the bridge (about a 15 minute walk with great views), but we saw buses going over there as well.",
          "Awed by the beauty and peace of the Arctic Cathedral! The architecture is fabulous and such a testament in connecting the area and religion.",
          "The church was nice, but I think the price is overrated to go inside. Churches are a place of worship and should be free of charge",
          "The Arctic Cathedral can be seen across the water from the main city area of Tromso. It is a beautiful building . A walk across the Tromso Bridge will take you to the Arctic Cathedral .",
          "Absolutely not to be missed. Quite expensive for 30mins but typical Norway and no regrets. The music was so beautiful. Enchanting.",
          "We went to a mid night concert in June so we were able to see the place in daylight. It has the appearance of several lumps of concrete propped against each other. That said it has produced excellent accoustics.",
          "If you do not have time to explore inside, take a good look from outside. The architecture is beautiful.",
          "It\u2019s expensive (50NOK per person) to visit a church and see a very nice stained glass window - A big part of which is covered by the white backdrop of the alter. The architecture is impressive but can be appreciated from outside. The staff refused to allow someone to use the",
          "Stopped briefly at the cathedral for photos. Neat architectural design. Could not go inside the see the stained glass windows because of a funeral in process.",
          "From a purely aesthetic perspective, this Parish Church displays interesting modern architecture from the outside and a beautiful mosaic stain glass appreciated inside, but not much more to take away beyond that as a visiting tourist. A little less that a mile walk from the",
          "The cathedral itself is very interesting but it's good to go there before or after mass cos then you can see locals in their typical clothing. Quite interesting",
          "We first viewed the cathedral from the dock side and wow what a sight it has truly been built to leave you in awe We walked from the dockside across the amazing bridge which is worth the walk on its own, then on to the cathedral. I was disappointed that you had to pay to go in",
          "Stunning modern architecture with light streaming through the stained glass and great acoustics making a superb venue for the midnight concert",
          "We visited here during the daylight hours then returned for a Midnight Concert . It is a lovely place quite unique in appearance and pleasing to look at both outside and in . The concert was wonderful even if I couldn't understand the words , it was so calm and restful ,",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is unique and cool to see if you are interested in architecture. You can see inside through the windows, and the inside is not very impressive. Wouldn't be worth the entrance fee.",
          "We attended the Midnight concert at the cathedral as part of our Hurtigruten cruise, it was such an amazing experience. the cathedral itself is stunning to look at both during the day and the night. sailing into Tromso it stands out magnificently against the mountain backdrop.",
          "As with most Protestant cathedrals/ churches, the interior is quite plain. The highlight is the stained glass window at the East / Altar side by Victor Sparre. Please check up the internet for details on the window.",
          "If you are religious this may appeal. The design of the building is interesting but when you get there you have to pay to go in. Taking a look through the windows the architecture itself is the interesting feature and this can be seen from a distance. The cathedral is 5-10",
          "It is a really nice building from outside, looks really nice as it is in the hills. we did not go inside as it was a little expenseive for such a small building. we did take a look inside, its like a regular church /cathedral. Must have been beautiful from inside as well.",
          "First of all, I don't know why people complaining about the 50 NOK fee. People would probably spend much more than that to come to Tromso or Norway and it costs almost cheaper than a cup of cappuccino. The fee is probably needed to maintain the amazing building and ground.",
          "We visited here whilst in town on a cruise ship in March. It is situated at the end of the Tromso Bridge and is an easy walk from the main city centre of Tromso. If your ship docks in town, it is perfect. If it docks out of town, you will have to get yourself into the main",
          "Well worth the walk across the bridge in Tromso as its so iconic a really outstanding feathure of the landscape",
          "We visited as part of a trip from our cruise ship. A very modern style triangular church with beautiful stained glass windows. The architecture symbolises the packed ice. The acoustics are said to be very good for the recitals held there.",
          "Very original church. I would recommended it because it\u2019s beautiful and you can see Troms\u00f8 from the other side of the bridge. Recomendable when walking to the Cable Car. The negative side: it costs 50 NOK, which I think is expensive.",
          "We went in a group from our cruise ship to an evening concert which was memorable. Great acoustics and musicians/singer.",
          "Well worth a visit. The cathedral is a simple but effective design but will not take long to see the inside. You may just wish to see the outside as this is the best view and to go in will cost you 50 NOK.",
          "I had long wished to see this icon of the Norwegian arctic and was not disappointed. We visited the Tourist Information Office close to the quay in Troms\u00f8 to buy bus tickets and get directions. Everyone speaks perfect English in Norway so independent travel is very easy. I think",
          "In many other places this would be a church rather than a cathedral, but from the outside it is spectacular and fits right in with the weather and scenery. So spend the 50 krona and go in. It is very nice and the stained glass window is spectacular. I imagine a concert would be",
          "Great landmark of tromso... Must go and check it out... Also if you are lucky enough you might even be able yo experience a concert in it... It claims yo have excellent accoustics.",
          "The exterior speaks for itself, but it is basically a church. As for interior, I skipped it as I am in disagreement one needs to pay to enter a place of religion. You can pretty much see everything from the outside by looking through the glass anyway. It wouldn't have been worth",
          "We went to the midnight concert in the Artic Cathedral from the southbound Hurtigruten boat. The hotel was great when we saw it in the daylight a couple of years ago, but by night with all the candles burning, it was magical. We were treated to some beautiful music by three",
          "We took a stroll around the city and headed to the Arctic Cathedral from the tourist centre. It was a neat building and at the entrance you have a good vantage point to the city scape of Tromso. Recommend to walk there.",
          "A truly amazing piece of architecture. Blends in so well with the arctic landscape. Nice shop to purchase cards and stamps. Lots of space to sit. Would recommend.",
          "The build g is stunning from th eoutside and I side. The stained glass windw and lights were really lovely . Wish there\u2019d been a concert !",
          "Gorgeous building.. looked amazing covered in snow. Its a definent for any visitor to tromso area.. great to stop by on wya to cable car",
          "Must see in Tromso but don't expect a lot. Definitely looks better from distance than close up. Average.",
          "I really enjoyed spending a little time here. It was peaceful and very pretty. You do pay a small fee to enter, so bring money. If you like to light a candle while at church, you will have the opportunity. I was there at nighttime. If I went again I would go a little before",
          "A modern church which gives access to a beautiful glass window and interior. Views across the bridge to Troms\u00f8. Admission fee \u00a35pp but you can take photos inside.",
          "First, I have to mention that the admission fee (at the time, 50 NOK) to the Arctic Cathedral is worth it. Compared to previous cathedrals I've visited over Europe and their architecture - its simplicity and symbolism was breathtaking!",
          "Lovely place to visit. Please check for opening times because they are a bit hit and miss. The northern light show in the celler is ok bit of a laugh.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral in Troms\u00f8 is a beautiful place to visit and photograph, both from the inside as well as from afar (from the Island side).",
          "We went to the midnight concert off a Hurtigruten ship and were very impressed with the architecture. Over the bridge but a must see if you are there",
          "Don't be deceived, it is not a cathedral but a church. It is small, but beautiful, and well worth the admission fee especially if you can get to see it with good sunlight lighting up the amazing glass pane window.",
          "This is worth the visit to see the building and the scenic views around it. It is a popular tourist site and not always open due to services. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "The church is located right off the Troms\u00f8 bridge about a 20 minute walk from downtown. It is a cold walk over the bridge but other than that it is not bad. The church itself is beautiful with Scandinavian architecture and interiors. Worth the visit. Charge is 50k pp",
          "Went to the cathedral but was closed. Got a inner view through the windows on front and on the side. Different and eye catching. In winters, on a sunny day walk to it.",
          "Can be seen from the docks when you are looking for the cable car. So modern and with easy access on the bus route, well worth a visit",
          "A fantastic concert. Definitely not to be missed when in Tromso. Magnificent, modern setting for the performance in the Arctic Cathedral, with beautiful acoustics. Superb performances by saxophonist, soloist and piano/organ.",
          "Visited this cathedral twice and the best time to see it is in the morning sun. When the sun shines through, it completely opens up to show the stunning design.",
          "Nice to take pictures and beautiful inside, but it's very small and has a fee just to walk in. I'd definitely recommend a visit though.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit.it is an excellent cathederal to visit different to what u imagine it to be.",
          "You have to take a bus or cab over the bridge (in winter) but it is definitely worth it. From the church you can get excellent shots of the city of Tromso!",
          "Went to the midnight concert at the cathedral organised by the cruise line and it was terrific. The acoustics were great and the selection of Norwegian songs and music were lovely. Even though it is cold and late it was great.",
          "This is actually a Methodist/Lutheran church but seems to be a general facility available to all faiths. It is a unique design and very impressive inside. It is used for some 500 concerts a year, more that one a day presumably because the acoustics are very good. A very popular",
          "An interesting modern cathedral, the walk across the bridge is very good and it is worth a quick stop to look at the cathedral but the best things in Tromso are natural not man made",
          "The cathedral consists of a simple sanctuary. There is no much history and there are no exhibits and commentary. The visit can be done in 5 minutes. Though the entrance fee is cheap compared to tge cost of anything else in Norway, the quality of experience is not worth commuting",
          "Apparently inspired by ice and snow the Cathedral sits above the port and fjord. Visited it in the early evening and it stood as a beacon of light amidst the February snow. Had the joy of attending a concert there by three musicians, entertaining with Norwegian themed music.",
          "I visited this site on a sunny but very cold morning; a very pleasant walk from the city centre (harbour). The cathedral is as impressive inside as it is on the outside: inside very tasteful decorations among which beautiful stained glass windows. Not to be missed if in Tromso!",
          "Beautiful and worth the visit if it\u2019s on the way but is it worth the price, I don\u2019t reckon. Staff wasn\u2019t friendly or helpful either. Went 5pm 4th March 2018.",
          "If you are passing through Tromso on a Hurtigruten trip, one of the planned excursions is to a Midnight Concert. This is a great experience and the quality of the performance of a mixture of Classical music and Local Folk music was magical.",
          "It's good for a short visit and I really liked the beautiful stained glass. Very easily to be reached by bus 20, 24,26 and 28.",
          "We attended a beautiful concert here . A soprano , piano, cellist and the church organ. It was an hour long and a ticket was required. It was a perfect thing to do at night with an easy bus ride across the bridge. Before entering the Cathedral we spotted a niceAurora to the",
          "For me, the arctic cathedral is really nothing special. It is a nice photomotive, when u take one from the other side of the Bridge, but if you stand in front of it or if u go inside, it is not more than a normal church. I went there for the Northern Lights Concert and was quite",
          "Worth seeing if passing by but wouldn't go out of my way to visit. Its just a modern large place of worship. No character to speak off. Wouldn't go again if in Tromso.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is a Tromso landmark & possibly the first venue that tourists visit. For a 50K fee it is worth a look. The interior is sleek modern & v peaceful with a beautiful stained glass window. My only reason for 3* is it doesn\u2019t take very long to see. 15 minutes &",
          "The cathedral is a real place of peace and calm. The place is alive in the sun. Recommend a visit, better still when you walk across the bridge.",
          "This is a must if you are in Tromso. White as snow, wonderfully illuminated by the sun or by spotlights in the evening. As bonus we had a concert of classic music inside the cathedral.",
          "We only got to visit the place during night time but it was still beautiful. TIP: Plan your day so that you can visit the Cathedral around 11am when there is daylight, because the light comes through the glass and looks magnificent. Then quicky after that, take the cable car up",
          "An excellent example of modern Scandinavian architecture. Winter concerts are organized late in the evening!",
          "We visited the cathedral after walking over the fantastic road bridge on our way to the cable car. If you like modern interesting construction, slabs of concrete making the triangle with glass infills at the joins. Very airy, bright and beautiful at night.",
          "We visited this church while we were at Tromso last week. It was such a beautiful place. While the church itself is not grand in comparison to more traditional churches in Europe, it is very unique with a good location from where you can see the city of Tromso. We stayed at",
          "On tours of Tromso we visited the Arctic Cathedral during the day and also at night for a midnight concert. The triangular church structure was build in 1965 on a commanding hill location. The architect wanted to suggest an arctic landscape. Originally the the glass behind the",
          "We attended the \u201cNorthern Lights Concert\u201d that is offered four nights/week at 11 PM. It was a magical experience. The acoustics of the cathedral are extraordinary and the three musicians are skilled enough to be booked anywhere in the world. The programme itself was",
          "This was on the way from our hotel to the cable car. I had read that it is compared with Sydney Opera house. However, have not visited that so cannot comment, but it is beautiful. Do not pass it, go inside and view. It is also very eye catching when illuminated at night.",
          "We visited this afternoon being in time for the advertised singing concert, paid admission for 50 Krona each and were then advised the concert was only scheduled at 2300 tonight. we feel the entrance fee excessive for <10minutes visit. The Cathedral is impressive inside and out",
          "Spectacular from a distance - less so close up. If you go to the ski lift then make sure to have a quick look here, but a quick look is all you really need.",
          "Beautiful church with great stained glass. Take the walk over the bridge - it\u2019s worth it at least one way if you can. It about 15-20 minutes over bridge",
          "The Artic Cathedral which is at the end of the bridge is on the way to the cable car so you can do both. I walked across the bridge from Tromso City Center which is an easy 20 minute walk but you can drive there or take a bus. There is a small charge to get in, 50 NOK/$6.36. On",
          "When you visit Troms\u00f8, you also visit the cathedral. It was beautiful to see but I think I expected more.",
          "ok for a trip if you have nothing else to do! in the evening the lights shine through the coloured glass windows. inside- nothing to write home about. music was ok. a bit souless",
          "Looks beautiful at night, lit up against the mountains. You can\u2019t help but see it. During the day it can still be seen. The stained glass windows are beautiful. Very much an active place of worship. For me it\u2019s beauty comes alive at night.",
          "My wife and I attended the northern lights concert as a light bit of evening entertainment with the faint hope that we might actually see the aurora if we got away feom the lights of Tromso proper. We were a little confused about which bus to take and if we needed cash for them,",
          "The Arctic Cathedral was truly disappointing - it might look a bit special by its looks but its also very selecting as they dont let people in. They didn't open before 1 pm and on top of this they charge 50 NOK to enter. That must be a joke!",
          "It is a magical place. I loved it. The arquitecture is very modern. The sight of the cathedral is beautiful Anyway we decided ro visit and pay the fee but one on my sons decided not to go in the temple The lady in charge of the tickets asked him to leave the entrance hall and",
          "Fantastic building from the outside , looks very scenic from the harbour , illuminated at night . Great shaped building , interesting stained glass window , but the inside is very bare ! A nice little shop , to by postcards etc and some lovely pictures of the northern lights .",
          "Well it\u2019s a nice place but you don\u2019t lose a lot if you don\u2019t visit it. But it\u2019s free for take pics \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
          "After a walk from the Polar Museum over the big bridge (aprox 30min) we arrived at the Cathedral ( entrance 50NOK = 5\u20ac) Inside simple but worth the entrance fee and a nice place to warm up a little bit in the wintertime.",
          "You should just take a look at this place from the outside, there is absolutely nothing to see once you get in.",
          "We were in Tromso for the holidays and attended the New Year's Eve concert at the Arctic Cathedral. It was a very nice concert with something for everyone.",
          "We visited in the daylight to see the huge and stunning stained glass and then returned in the evening for the Northern Lights concert. A wonderful 30 minutes of haunting, uplifting and beautiful music.",
          "In my pre-trip research of Tromso I'd seen so many pictures of this church that I was intrigued to see it for real.  I will admit to just peering in through the doors and not actually entering as was more interested in the exterior architecture which is definately unique.",
          "We went over to the Arctic Cathedral for their Northern Lights concert at 11PM. Charming and lovely. Three very good musicians, a soprano, a flautist who also plays the \"yolk,\" (like a tiny piccolo,) and a man who played the piano and organ. The music was about 35 minutes of",
          "It was a pity that it was not open in the morning when we went after walking 30' from our hotel. It should be very nice to see the glass behind from the inside",
          "Anyone visiting Tromso must go to the Cathedral, although it is possibly the smallest cathedral I have been to. Easy access over the bridge and can be included during a visit to the cable car.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral boasts Europe\u2019s second largest mosaic glass window. If you are in the mood for some walking, you could walk across the Tromso Bridge and reach your destination. It costs 50 NOK to enter. You could take a seat at the back of the cathedral and watch the",
          "There is nothing interesting inside the building. So no need to pay money. You can take a photo from outside, because the image of the cathedral/ the view is very nice, also taking photo is free !",
          "There's nothing really to see, better to see it from outside rather than paying 50 NOK for nothing...",
          "It has a very typical trangular ice block design by famous architect Mr.Hoving. It is located at the end of bridhe and in a higher place and it is a land mark of Tromso and it is visible from most part of the city. With massive glass walls and huge cross it is differenr from",
          "We went to a magical concert at midnight on our Hurtigruten coastal voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes and back. It began with a soprano singing from the balcony in front of the organ behind us - a haunting solo. It was followed by a series of pieces with the singer accompanied by",
          "I was really impressed by the structure of this cathedral, so different from the traditional structures we\u2019re used to seeing for religious institutions. Just walk around and observe, sit in silence, or pray. Ask the person at the counter for the book with details about the",
          "Visited on the way back from cable car. Worth a quick visit to view the stained glass window and the architecture.",
          "From across the bridge, this cathedral is instantly noticeable cause of it's shape and size in relation to its surrounding buildings. It looks amazing from far just like it does close up! Definitely worth a visit!",
          "The world most northern-most cathedral. The architecture is beautiful, which inspired by the sami culture, externally and internally. There's a bus stop right outside the cathedral if you wish to get there. Otherwise, if you fancy a walk, going across the bridge would bring you",
          "We attended a midnight concert at this church. While the view is beautiful and church is pretty, the acoustics is amazing! It made the concert experience worth every minute.",
          "This really stands out in the Tromso skyline. Amazing from any angle and the triangular stained glass window is amazing.",
          "It is the bigest landmark of the city - you must see it. It looks nice but we did not feel needs to go inside.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is in an imposing position, of interesting design. We were disappointed at the charge of 50 Kn to enter. Written up in brochures as spectacular we found the interior to be simple and charming. It\u2019s a lovely place to sit quietly and contemplate or pray but",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is inland just next to the long bridge. It is a modern cathedral and it\u2019s architecture is characteristic. Try to go when de Nordlysfestivalen happend in late january.",
          "It is the landmark of Tromso, a master piece by architect Jan Inge Hoving , inaugurated 1965. The shape and color give associations to an iceberg. The glass mosaic is just magnificent. A place you must visit.",
          "Walked over the bridge to see the artic catherdal. Unusal building. Nice view accross the water to the city. Looks great at night also. Couldnt get to see inside as there was a funeral going on.",
          "Looked amazing Day and night from the outside worth the walk across the bridge didn\u2019t go inside as pushed for time",
          "A very simple place with exquisite stained glass centre piece behind the altar. Its main effect comes when you stand outside at the front and it appears that you can almost see through the building",
          "50NOK entrance, simple sterile interior, from my point of view too glowing name for simple modern church",
          "This is a lovely building with clean lines, beautiful crystal chandeliers and a magnificent stained glass wiondow. However, the stained glass doesn't show up well inside when its dark out. It does show up outside when the lights are on inside but its difficult to make out the",
          "Beautiful architecture. Definitely one of the postcards of Tromso. Unfortunately they do charge an entry fee, however the interior is very down to earth, not sure why charge the visitor.",
          "The modern architectural highlight of Tromsoe. Modern, austere, clear lines. Great stain glass windows )but these are difficult to see during the polar night...). A great organ inside, Definitely wirth a visit - you pay an entrance fee just like in Trondheim's cathedrale.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit. The stainglass window, the crystal lights and the organ are all wonderful. The outside of the building is also very impressive.",
          "Attended the Midnight Sun Concert. Just beatiful and the sun rays entering the Church, even at midnight is very special.",
          "What a stunning building. Our trip took us here in the dark. And it really makes an impression when you approach it. Lit up as a fantastic piece of architecture And the dark gives you the opportunity to admire the main window",
          "Beautiful cathedral but the only unfortunate thing was the church was closed. This would have been excellent as i walked so far and would not go inside",
          "Walk over the bridge or catch the bus - great views from outside. The building is impressive and in keeping with the surrounds. The inside is modern - simplistic but with a lovely feeling. Beautiful window, comfy pews and a comfortable seating area.",
          "This cathedral is worth seeing from the outside. The stained glass windows amazing. but i found the interior to be quite stark.",
          "As many others have put the architecture outside is the best feature, inside is as you would expect the workings of a cathedral and very simplistic so unless there is a concert on or you want to visit for religious reasons then not worth the 50NOK entrance fee. Beautifully",
          "We attended a Sunday morning service here in January. Lovely to hear the hymns (especially away in a manger ) in Norwegian. We were very lucky when we went as there were 4 infants being baptised and some of the girls in the congregation were dressed in traditional national",
          "Walked over the bridge to the cathedral - what a great view but watch the winds. The cathedral stained glass was lovely but can be admired from outside rather than inside but for 50k it was nice to get out of the cold",
          "The best view of the Arctic Cathedral is from the waterfront in the city center at night, not from inside the church. Don't bother with the easy but very expensive bus ride and the admission charge unless you are seeing a concert or want to go to a service. The pipe organ is",
          "Personally would skip the 50 krone entrance and enjoy it from the outside. The stained glass is far more attractive from outside and there is nothing much to see inside. Best if there is a concert or coincides with an organ recital, otherwise not worth a fee.",
          "Lovely church that we visited on Christmas Eve. We were graciously allowed to sit in on the Christmas Eve service. Afterward we walked around to see the inside and outside of the church. It makes for stunning pictures at dusk/night with the inside lights.",
          "A beautiful addition to the skyline of Troms\u00f8. A great iconic building to photograph from many different sides of the city!",
          "Very plain on the inside but a fine looking building on the outside. Distinctive. If you don't want to walk over the bridge - you can catch buses from the centre of Tromso (No 20)",
          "Definitely worth a walk over the bridge to see, also lovely views back over the bridge to Troms\u00f8 island",
          "We walked across the bridge from Tromso, unfortunately we couldn't go inside as there was a funeral in progress. We took some great photos of Tromso from that side, would definitely recommend a visit, very different architecture.",
          "Spectacular setting for the midnight concert in which, among other exquisite pieces, Grieg was featured at length. Highly worth a visit due to its unique architecture.",
          "The outside looks very nice and different. Inside, after you paid your entrance fee it's a little boring....",
          "We walked from our hotel to the cable car and back. The Arctic Cathedral looks impressive from across the river but on our return journey seeing the stained glass window all lit up in the twilight - wow!",
          "We walked over the bridge from which there are great views on the way. The Arctic Cathedral is a spectacular building that is lit up at night and is a real feature of Tromso. We didn't go inside.but recommend walking to the rear of the building to appreciate the stained glass",
          "was here again after 2014 and we had tickets for a midnight concert. THe artists were a female singer, a pianist and a female flute player. The program were nothern norwegian songs and some old traditional songs fro mthe Samen. Very interesting performance, some songs were",
          "This is a stunning building but I would save your money and not bother going in. In my opinion the most beautiful part of the building is the stained glass window, visible from behind. There are a few stunning chandeliers inside but for me otherwise it was unremarkable (if you",
          "We walked across the bridge during the polar nights and saw the cathedral on our way to the cable car. The architecture is beautiful, particularly when illuminated at night. I highly recommend checking out the exterior. We didn't go inside as it didn't seem worth the cost and",
          "We walked over the bridge twice in order to see the Cathedral during the day and at night. It looks wonderful lit up and made for some really nice photographs!",
          "I was a bit dissapointed. I thought I could expect more but when we arrived there was actually nothing special. If you are in Tromso and you are not able to go to the cathedral you are not gonna miss anything.",
          "The walk from centre city cooler than the church. Just go. You\u2019ll see everything you need to see in 10 minutes.",
          "Ok, so I'm not dissing this wonderful building, but rather like Sydney Opera House it's better viewed from the Mossman ferry than close up. When seen against the backdrop of the mountains it is lovely, but having slogged across the bridge in a blizzard, it was utterly",
          "We visited this lovely cathedral on a two day stay in Tromso. The outside is the most impressive part and it is worth walking around the back to view the stained glass from outside - particularly in the dark. The building is sleek and not like other cathedrals although I think",
          "The Ishavskatedralen is Troms\u00f8\u2018s landmark and well worth the walk across the bridge. The view of the city and the fjord is great from the bridge and the cathedral. We did it during polar night darkness and I can recommend it. The illumination is beautiful and the look is iconic.",
          "Ishavskatedralen (The Arctic Cathedral) is supposedly the northernmost church in the world. The building itself is very unique, with great views overlooking downtown Tromso. Do check the opening hours before visiting to avoid disappointment not being able to enter the building.",
          "worth the visit if only for the exterior - funeral in progress when we visited - stained glass is stunning by night",
          "We joined the Christmas Service on Dec. 24th. It was in Norwegian language, but that didn't bother us at all.",
          "After enjoying views from the top of the cable car, we traipsed through the snow to have a look at the cathedral only to find it was closed. A group of school kids charged past us in the hope of visiting it as well, so not sure who knows when to visit. But as the buses stop",
          "The building is impressive from the outside and looks beautiful both by day & by night (lit up) The structure replicates jagged icebergs,striking white with glass accents Can be seen from across the bridge and is worth the bridge walk (weather permitting) Entry fee of 50 NOK",
          "Artic Cathedral is unique in terms of its architecture. Different! Impresive! You ca go to Midnight Sun concerts!!",
          "We\u2019d read about Tromso\u2019s impressive and iconic Ishavskatedralen (it\u2019s a church not a cathedral apparently) so decided to walk there from the Fjellheisen cable car (about 10 minutes away through a pleasant suburb). Opened in 1965, it consists of 11 steeply angled aluminium coated",
          "The cathedral was closed but we could see through the windows. It is empty beside bench... Nothing really interesting, worth to go just to take pictures.",
          "Nice to see when it's night at the outside. Inside (entrance NOK 50) not so spectacular. Maybe in summer when the sun shines.",
          "Beautiful! What more can I add! A stunning addition to our trip to Tromso and even more magical on New Years Eve. We were even lucky enough to have a Northern Lights display on our departure from the concert! Wow! Beautiful building, clean and well organised. Staff friendly and",
          "You can take either bus 20, 24 or 26 to get there. Usually takes about 30-40 minutes to walk around, make some pictures, enjoy the view and go back to bus stop, that way, the ticket you purchased to go to the church will be still valid to return or continue you way. This time of",
          "Unexpected that admission was charged. Could be walked to from city center but take wind into account as crossing the bridge could be challenging when it is cold. Beautiful inside and worth a visit but is just as beautiful from the outside or lit up at night.",
          "The Hurtigruten ship stops on the Northern sailing during the day. Time to enjoy Tromso be daylight. The Cathedral is beautiful architecture replicating jagged icebergs -- striking white with the stained glass colored accent. Great views of Tromso as it sits high on a hill. On",
          "We attended the annual Christmas concert. It was lovely evening filled with wonderful Christmas hymns and music. We took a bus there, and it was easy and quick. We walked back to our hotel, a lovely and scenic walk over the bridge.",
          "We hiked across the river bridge to the building from the harbour. It may be more impressive in the winter than summer since it is all lit against the dark sky. From what we could see inside is spartan and functional. Its the exterieur that's so remarkable. Lovely stained glass",
          "I was told this was closed today , however expecting to arrive to talk some external pictures I was not surprised as it was Sunday to find the doors open and the church full to capacity - the music and the crowds were amazing and it added to a wonderful Christmas Eve.",
          "Outside is a beautiful structure and a great view of Troms\u00f8. We paid 50 kroner per person to go inside. It was worth the small price. A band was practicing and we got to hear them. The inside is beautiful. Parking is easy. They have a lot next to the building and just across",
          "We were there this December and the cathedral is made out of iron and steel recovered from a sunk German war ship ! It\u2019s a piece of history worth visiting",
          "Caught the local bus - make sure you have a prepaid travel card - as it is quite a walk from Tromso town across the bridge. Cathedral is beautiful but only requires a short visit to see everything. We walked on and caught the ski lift which gave beautiful views.",
          "The Arctic cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Tromso. The church looks great from outside and the best views are at night when the lights are on. It costs NOK 50 per person to get inside the church, however there is nothing inside to view so don\u2019t waste your money,",
          "We could see the cathedral light up from our hotel (Clarion With - stay there; it\u2019s great) and wanted to see it close up. It is beautiful - wonderful use of glass and light. The downside ? It was closed to visitors, even though it was the middle of the day and there were",
          "This Cathedral I think is last and biggest towards the Artic circle. Its stained glass and chandeliers are just fantastic. A must visit when in Tromso.",
          "A good piece of art is timeless. This is exactly what the Norwegian architect, Jan Inge Hovig, did for Arctic Cathedral. It reminded me of Frank Lloyd Wright's design for the Guggenheim museum in NYC. It is such a pity that this Cathedral had erratic opening times and charges",
          "A very modern lutheran church built in the 70ies. From an architecture point of view it's quite a thinking to design and build a structure in that fashion. You can catch a buss right from the centrum to this place, or you can walk which probably take about 25 minutes from the",
          "The highlight of Troms\u00f8, and possibly the most beautiful building in the entire North of Norway. Best viewed fromt the outside in winter, and best viewed from the inside in summer, so you'll have to visit twice. The building itself is the real star here, look at how the cross is",
          "We visited the Cathedral based on good reviews about it. As I expected, the building was very nice and modern; I really appreciated the design. Since we couldn't go inside because of the Christmas Concert, I highly recommend checking opening hours before coming here.",
          "We only got to view from the outside as we arrived around noon. I nice spot for some pictures though. You need to walk under the bridge to get round to the front of the building. We would have liked to have a cuppa and a cake in the area but could not find anywhere to do this.",
          "If you are on one of the Hurtigruten cruises and you are thinking twice about booking the Midnight concert at the Artic Cathedral, don't because it interrupts your nights sleep. Catch up on your sleep later and go. It is absolutely magnificent church and a magnificent concert.",
          "when you happened to be in Tromso , it is a must to visit.you will see a very nice view of the island and the sea . A must!!!",
          "This is definitely worth a visit for the window. To see the lovely colours and design you have to walk outside around the back of the cathedral. The inside is very plain.",
          "We went on a very snowy day but still enjoyed the lovely cathedral. Don't miss the stained glass window in the back. One thing to note is that it does not open until late in the day so we got there after 12:30 and it was not open yet. We still took some beautiful pictures. We",
          "Perched high up on the hill, next to the road to the cable car to the mountain! It is modern and outstanding! Well done!",
          "It is a very nice cathedral but on my visit from 4 dec. to 9 dec. 2017 it was most of the time closed, i\u00b4d said closed AT ALL TIMES, according with what other fellow tourists told me.THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED, IT IS NOT NICE FOR AL THE VISITORS WHO COME IN DECEMBER TO FIND IT",
          "This cathedral is a must on anyone's visiting list, very friendly welcome from Patricia who was very helpful.",
          "The church is nice enough, with a stained glass facade on one side that\u2019s very pretty in the dark, but there\u2019s nothing very interesting about it on the inside - skip it on the trip to the other side of Troms\u00f8, or else just take pics of the exterior - no need to go inside.",
          "The outside of the building can be seen all round and looks fab , so thinking the inside would be better we paid \u00a35 to go in .. no atmosphere no information no anything totally waste of money if you want to see it look in the window . The slope down it\u2019s not for the faint heated",
          "The church looks great from far away- and is quite pretty looking closely... We found even nice Aquarell paintings from troms\u00f8 a regions and met the artist:-) Just careful in case it is snowing/freezing/... the entrance is slippery ;-kr",
          "Very nice place to stop by during the dark winter nights. In contrast to other Lutherian churches in Norway, this one is open for tourists. The entrance fee is 50 NOK. Also check the back side with its colourful mosaic.",
          "The view from outside of the Cathedral is very pretty, overlooking the city. Its 50Nok to go inside the Cathedral, which was quite pricey. Was bit disappointed inside, expected more.",
          "Great building. Really different and interesting to look at. Big inside. Right next to main road. Walked over bridge from main tromso to get to.",
          "Very icy slippy walk up to the cathedral, in early winter shoe spikes might be an idea. We went in and then were told it wasn't actually open, they kindly let us look around however the stain glass wasn't lit up. Check opening hours prior to visiting. Looks prettier from",
          "Went there on a sunday with a great choire singing inside. The building is prettier in the distance.",
          "Great building, beautiful design, looks fantastic from the outside when lit up at night, we\u2019ll worth a visit. We bought the Tromso pass allowing free access to the Cathedral and many other places, we\u2019ll worth a vidit",
          "This is a very impressive building which can be seen easily from either side of the river. I walked over the bridge to the church only to find it was closed for a private service and not open until 3pm , tourists can get some good photos of the exterior but I am afraid I",
          "Visited after dark (15.20) Sunday. Stained glass window illuminated from inside. Doubtful of need to visit inside.",
          "This is a lovely building but if going to it via the big white bridge be careful very snowy and slippy. It is up and down hill so if not good on feet think twice. You could get a taxi around road but still slopes up to get to cathedral when get out of taxi. Go in the summer or",
          "it is a great church in a real northern style was there also for sunday service, as its an evangelic church for me as chatolic it was very unusual but very beautyful to assist",

          "I wouldn't pay the 50 NOK admission fee but it is definitely worth viewing up close. Impressive. You can easily combine this with a trip up the cable car (Fjellheiset), and if it's a nice day, a walk over the bridge from Tromso.",

          "Ah here's the type of museum I really like. Interesting, fun, with dept and lots of information. Different exhibitions here and there, you'll need at least two hours to explore and dive in all of it. Too bad I visited it on a Sunday and had only an hour and some minutes left.",
          "quite a bit of information,the displays are noted in Norwegion,but guide sheets provided in other languages",
          "Just a great trip to Tromso Museum. Made our day. Fantastic collection of artefacts ! Never knew so much about reindeers and arctic wildlife. Learnt a lot about Nordic hunters and various tools used by them for hunting. Overall a great experience indeed. FIVE STARS to the",
          "Fascinating exhibition on the Sami (ex-eskimos) and great geology section too. Can get there from town by bus, is a great way to see more of Tromso Island",
          "This was the only place we hadn\u2019t already visited that was open on New Year\u2019s Day and it was well worth the trek on foot up a hill with suitcases (our flight left the same evening). We received a friendly welcome before going into the first exhibition hall. There were lots of",
          "Really nice small museum. Well maintained and cheerful staff. Art was exhibited nicely and the \"like Bitzy\" theme was well done throughout.",
          "We spent a long time here. Natural history, geology, culture plus an added bonus of a Christmas carol recital. Museum is a little out of town by the Folkeparken but a lovely walk.",
          "This is an informative museum, a little dated but good information. The natural history section is the best.",
          "This museum is worth while any visit, alone the busride nr 37 is worth doing. Do not miss it. Got everything interesting about the area and the arctic life",
          "The museum is good although the most interesting information foreings (from my point o view) is the culture of the Sami Culture; which unfortunately was just in Norwegian...",
          "From geology to Sami life & culture - there\u2019s so much to see and absorb in what is actually a small museum. Fantastic film about the Northern Lights too (among others at a little screening area at the back of the geology section) which we watched as a bit of educational prep and",
          "We were on an organized tour, and unfortunately didn't have nearly enough time to spend in this very interesting museum. Our guide took us to the Sami displays, and while it was very interesting, I would have liked to have seen more of the museum. I could see the large",
          "Nice visit of an interesting museum where we have improved our knowledge about nature, human being and so on. I kindly recommend it.",
          "exhibition mostly for school children but very nice to sit in the sami house next to the museum and get to know more about the life over a cup of coffee.",
          "This museum could be great, but it has flaws. Firstly, the layout of the museum is lacking. Half of the downstairs exhibition is devoted to general geology and volcanos, which seems unnecessary. The upstairs exhibitions of Sami culture and their rights, I'm sure would be very",
          "If you are curious about the Sami people, the indigenous people of north Scandinavia, this is a great place to learn about them. There is a whole section on the second floor dedicated to them. It is very thorough and very respectfully done.",
          "The exhibition in the museum was very interesting. It reflected the warmth of the people and the colours found in the black and white landscape.",
          "We stopped at the museum as part of an excursion booked through our cruise ship. It's a small, but very interesting museum. We stayed with our tour guide who focused on the Sami exhibition which was fascinating and sad in many ways - much like the history of so many other",
          "Lots of interesting artifacts and exhibits but a bit of a challenge for one who does not read Norwegian well.",
          "So much is in the world we do not know. Learning about other cultures and what made us brings one to a humble admition we all are creatures of love, pride, dignity, gumption and dreams.",
          "Good place to spend an hour or two before flight back to the UK and get out of the snow. Loved the section on Early human migrations into to Scandinavia.",
          "Visited here while staying in the city, there were extra temp exhibits on which I think may be how we spent so long going around it all. Cost to get in was quite cheap, and a cup of tea was even cheaper, just what you needed after walking around in the snow all day! There",
          "The museum provides good details about the culture, history, animals, birds etc. It could have been made more contemporary. We had to abandon our visit there half way since the fire alarm started ringing and hence entire place was evacuated. The outside ambience was very good.",
          "The Museum has a really well prepared & very interesting exhibitions, among others - about the Sami people.",
          "In an hour (in November 2017) I got a solid understanding of my ancestors, some of whom came from near Tromso in Norway's far north. Modest as the museum is, a lot of information is conveyed well, including recounting Norway's history of mistreating its Sami minority with more",
          "The museum is quite small, descriptions are in Norwegian and just sometimes in English. They show a 30 minute video about the northern lights which I can recommend to visit. All fine, especially considering the low entrance fee. However, nothing special and only worth it if you",
          "Nice museum, very kind people. Part of mueum is about tropical spiders etc, not to be expected here. Museum is planning to rebuild in the next years.",
          "Came on the basis of the reviews here. Unfortunately, we were most interested in the Sami of the past exhibition, but no English information available. Also I find keeping live insects and arachnids in small tanks for humans to ogle at kind of disturbing. Sure, it's informative,",
          "We really enjoyed our visit today. A nice afternoon learning about the history of the area and its people. I enjoyed learning something about Sami culture, accomplishments, and future, as well as about the natural history here.",
          "Interesting history of Tromso and Norway. Lots of artefacts and information with a guided tour. Small gift shop at entrance with handmade items.",
          "Went with my wife. Saw lots of good stuff. The solar winds and sami exhibits were really informative. The lady at the end of the day sorted out our ride back. Thank you. And thank you for your amazing English.",
          "Decent museum with a variety of things to see - from native animals to the way folks lived and their tools as well as ocean travel. Kids under 12 would probably like this.",
          "Museum is good for kids very interested history about Saami people. The museum had a wonderful movie about the Northern Light.",
          "A beautiful display of statues, carvings etc from old Norwegian churches plus interactive displays in the climate display. Knowing nothing about the Sami people, I found the section there confusing however the excellent gift shop had a book on their history, culture and politics",
          "We enjoyed seeing the museum. The gift shop had souvenirs that were better quality and price than available in the shops. I came back to buy after our visit.",
          "Along with the natural history of Norway, there was a floor dedicated to the history of the Sami culture, the indigenous people of Norway. The telling of this history mirrors the history of so many people around the world. It is presented in pictures and artifacts and is worth",
          "This was our first visit. There is a 25 minute film on the Northern Lights which is interesting. The exhibits could do with modernising. Cafe- service lovely but very limited food.",
          "Was interesting to find out a lot about the Sami people and also the wildlife that live in the Arctic. Went with the family and got in using the Tromso Pass which I would highly recommend.",
          "Small museum with an entrance fee of 60 NOK. One exhibition about Arctic animals, one about Sami culture, one changing exhibition and one mix of different things. Worth a visit, but don' t expect to see unseen things.",
          "I like it. The entrance cost 60 but if you buy a double ticket for the polar museum and this you can pay 80 for both... Is nice... Beautiful and with story... They give you an english's guide",
          "A very interesting museum, but the best attraction is outside the museum When you come out of the main door turn left, then left again to walk down the road about 50 metres and on the right there is a sign. Tucked in the edge of the bush with a grass roof is a Sami structure.",
          "Was particularly interested in the exhibition on the Sami people. This place is worth a visit - excellent displays and material in English.",
          "The Tromso Museum was a nice place to visit. This museum has am interesting display on the Aurora Borealis.Also, there is a section that documents the life of the Sami people and it also has some interesting artifacts.",
          "The museum at university it is really interesting and worth a visit, it is rather big and with many different exhibitions, explains well the different aspects of life in the Arctic regions, ranging from animals to pollution and the northern lights. Easy to reach if you have a",
          "Norways explora history is interesting and somewhat brutal. Lots of arctic animals has been killed for absolutly nothing. And eventhough the exibithion is somewhat old its interessting",
          "I thought we\u2019d nip round here fairly rapidly. Wrong. Quiet, calm and restful wander around a range of fascinating exhibits loosely based on Troms\u00f8 and the surrounding area. Not very interactive- so young children may get a bit restive. NB: THREE MUSEUM TICKET - At NOK30",
          "I really found the Sami exhibition very interesting and enlightening. Both the one showing their traditional way of life, but also the one following their struggle to gain recognition and rights as a nation. We had a lovely visit to the Sami house, where a very friendly and",
          "A nice place that tells a bit about the original inhabitants - the Sami (who were not bound by political borders - they lived/wandered in Norway, Sweden and Finland - around the mountains they share.",
          "The various exhibits and displays provide a unique and effective introduction to the nature and culture of the northern regions of Norway. The exhibits and displays are well done with quality explanations that will help you understand what you are viewing. There is an",
          "Visited as part of a tour and was impressed with the quality of the displays and visuals. They have a beautiful video of aurora borealis! The Sami display was made even better by the guide that led us through. They have done a great job of honoring their indigenous population.",
          "The Museum is frequently visited by bigger groups of the visitors. From city center Bus no 37 is leaving, every half an hour for this Museum. It would be more interesting to the visitors if the films and more photos are displayed to show the life of Sami people and their animals.",
          "This museum is fabulous!! and you can pay a little more for your entry and get entry to the polar museum included, a good saving. The staff were so helpful, we asked what time the film of the Northern lights showed , we were told to just let the young lady know when we were",
          "It seemed to be small from outside but there are actually lots to see. From animals and plants in Norway, aurora light show, to history of Nordic inhabitants, one should spend half day here to experience the effort they have put in. There is also a good collection of books",
          "This museum requires a short bus ride on the number 37 bus if you are staying in the city centre, but it is worth it (use the mobile apps for travel planning and ticketing for a cheaper price). There are quite a few different exhibits, my favourite was the one about Sami",
          "A room follow the other, it a quite big museum with all details you are looking for about local history. A guide in more or less every language is available",
          "A guide is definitely worth having to help explain the Sami history and the development of the region. There are also exhibits dealing with religion and natural history. A very interesting museum.",
          "Worth a visit for the history of Sami nation. Good information and friendly staff. Would recommend especially when coupled with a walk from Tromso Centre.",
          "It has the history I wanted to know and very nice exhibits. Plus some artifacts I cannot imagine finding anywhere else. Take a taxiing you are not good with maps. I got lost walking there from city center but I am really no5 good with a map. Taxi is cheap enough.",
          "We enjoyed the exhibitions on Sami culture, very interesting and informative. Tasty, freshly made waffles in the cafe were delicious. We also visited the park beyond the museum and walked along the beach. There are buses but it was only a half hour walk from the centre.",
          "The Tromso Museum is housed near Tromso University and has some sections on Northern Lights and some on Arctic Life. Somehow, it lacks some objective and number of exhibits to have any impact on you. You can visit if you have time. The shop in entry foyer has some interesting",
          "Must seen museum in Troms\u00f8. It is not really big but very informative. The musuem is in the city center of Troms\u00f8. They have also a small gift shop.",
          "Had to kill some day time hence went to this museum with no expectations but was pleasantly suprised. Kids loved it and museum contains evolution sections related to Darwin , about Sami culture and there is also a film about Northern lights to be seen. But we had already seen",
          "My husband and I visited here recently and thoroughly enjoyed learning about the Sami people. The exhibits are super interesting with such rich history. We just wish more of it could have been in English. Tip: It's a lovely (but long) walk from the downtown area. We walked from",
          "What a brilliant place to spend an afternoon. Un-prepossessing from the outside, the museum was one of the best days of our two week stay in Tromso. The compelling narrative of the great arctic explorations that fills a huge chunk of this museum left us both overwhelmed at the",
          "This university museum had enough culture and tradition for me and enough science and technology for him. Good overview of Semi fight for recgnition. Nice overview of how and what the lights are formed. Good thing we took a taxi as it's not a straight amble from the centre on",
          "A friendly welcome from staff. Some interesting exhibitions from this area with a focus on the original people\u2019s , Sami, who lived and worked in this area many years ago. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is very informative you can touch the displays shame not all the written information is in English",
          "Spent an enjoyable day at the museum, there was a lift to the first floor which made it very accessible for me and my wheelchair. Didn\u2019t know anything about Sami culture before the visit, but feel we know more now. The ticket allows us to visit the polar,useum ehich we will do",
          "Interesting location right on the water, with some great information on the local terrain. Some good exhibits.",
          "This was a very interesting museum that contained a lot of exhibits to give a really good understanding of life around Tromso. It was well laid out and easy to follow the displays. Well worth a visit.",
          "We went to the museum bc of poor weather and our tour that day was canceled. The displays are well done and you learn quite a bit about the local and regional history. To read the whole English pamphlet they provide while you tour the rooms takes a good hour. There are lots of",
          "We had a lovely visit to the museum. So informative with some fantastic graphics and displays. Really good insight into Norwegian and Sami culture, really well displayed. Do visit as you will not be disappointed.",
          "A small museum dedicated to the history of the local area. The exhibits are interesting, informative and relevant in understanding the development of the community in and around Troms\u00f8. It includes an excellent explanation of the science behind the Northern Lights which we saw",
          "Entrance is Free and the experience is extremely interesting. Details and exhibitions of real life experiences of local people going back over a century. Lot's of great photo's capturing the harsh conditions of living in the artic conditions. Very Worthwhile a visit",
          "Extremely interesting but although some parts were in English others were not so although I have some Norwegian I felt I missed out on parts of it. Non English speakers would have even more of a problem. the contents of the museum were absolutely brilliant though.",
          "If you wish a quick overview of Natural Norway, the Sami People (Finmark Region), Political History mixed with science this is the place. Very nice displays with sort narratives. Located in a residential area, initially challenging to find, but well worth the visit. Use your 2",
          "I'm having my northern light tour in this museum and having a great time afterwards. If you like to visit museum and getting to know about history this is nice place to visit. The staff is very friendly and helpful and also there's a nice caffe that you can visit in here to warm",
          "It is an interesting museu, very interactive,some parts need English translation, different topics: history, Aurora, native people, etc",
          "There was a variety of things to see and interact with. I found all the information on the sami people very fasinating. An enjoyable but educational experience!!",
          "An all encompassing museum that covers Sami history, vikings, ocean life, Norwegian wild animals and pests around the house :D There is also a very good film that goes on a loop so make sure you talk to the front desk for the times. The building also houses a tourist shop.",
          "The Tromso Museum has a good combination ticket (Tromso Museum + Ploar Museum) costing 60 NOK. The exhibition on the ground floor which has exhibits about the animals and birds of Northern Norway was fascinating. The museum also has a Northern Lights exhibit with an interactive",
          "The museum is on the university's grounds. Free weekend parking. Interesting exhibits on a smaller scale. Particularly appreciated the gallery that showcased the Sami people's history and culture. There is a cafe there that offers decent hot drinks. Free wifi.",
          "This not a large building but it contains a lot of historical in the 3-floor structure. We visited on a rather rainy day so windows/doors were closed. By the time we reached the top floor, it we VERY warm and stuffy. The majority of the info was in Norwegian but there was a",
          "The Troms\u00f8 museum has exhibits of the wildlife and fauna of the arctic area with a few taxidermic animals like the king of the arctic. The highlight is the exhibition of the Sami culture which gives a new perspective of these first inhabitants of the great north and their fight",
          "The best bit for me was going insdie the sami hut (to the side of the building- with smoke coming out) and having a hot drink and listening to the stories. Beware you will smell very smokey afterwards!",
          "We went here as stopping by 1 day in Tromso off peak season - no midnight sun, no northern lights. This museum is a good way to spend 1-2 hours to get a mix of light information on nature, Sami and northern lights. If you have never looked up the origin of the aurora borealis,",
          "Loved our day in Tromso. We visited Tromso Museum in a group. The Art and artefacts were very interesting. Friendly helpful staff. One young woman was from the same place as us - Liverpool, England! Her Dad works as an engineer in Tromso. Small world! Everything here is",
          "This listing really should be renamed because the museum is actually called the Troms\u00f8 University Museum. It is located slight out of town from the center on the university campus. There are, however, a couple of buses that go out there and it is only a 10 minute or so ride.",
          "We can definitely recommend the museum. It is a small museum mainly dealing about the Sami people, history and culture. Outside the museum is a Sami hut and you get free coffee and nice stories about the culture. At 13:30 the museum offers a guided tour through the exhibition.",
          "I liked the location, a bit away from the centre, and I loved the different museum parts. Not only do we learn about the S\u00e1mi, the Northern lights, the \"humans and fire\" etc etc, but also about the history of cultural exhibitions (if you know how to look..). It is clear that",
          "Interesting exhibition about the Same culture, but clearly several decades old and quite worn. Deserves a thorough brush-up.",
          "When we got there, on a rainy day (yes rain, not snow, April can be cruel) the place was deserted. We took a bus from the centre of Tromso and it took a while to get there (it was quite far on foot) and we were expecting a lot more. The best thing was the Sami exhibition: very",
          "Interesting museum with a good mix of exhibits. Passed an enjoyable couple of hours here. The museum is more informative than interactive, go with limited expectations and you won't be disappointed. My 7 year old son enjoyed it, particularly the animal exhibits.",
          "We went to the local store (our equivalent to a seven eleven) and bought a bus pass. The cashier explained to us what the best routes were. We ended up at the museum where they had several displays of Norwegian history and artifacts dating back centuries. Definitely worth the",
          "I went to this museum during a visit to Tromso. There is an excellent display showing details of the northern lights, there is also good information and displays on the Sami People. There is also much of interest in other displays. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended.",
          "If you're looking for something to fill in time, this is a pretty good place to spend some time. We like to explore new places on foot, so we took off in search of the walking path that should take you there. We had a nice walk through the city of Tromso and came out right by",
          "I had a nice walk there for about 30-40 minutes from the city center. It was my first time learning about Sami people, their ways of living and cultures. It is so beautiful and I am happy I went there. Besides that, I also get to know more about Arctic wildlife, the northern",
          "There is not a huge amount to do here, but it did fill in some time and encourage us to use public transport to take a tour of the whole island.",
          "Very nice place, full of history and interesting decoration illustrating it. The exhibitions are full of information. The store is a little bit expensive. You have to take a bus or a cab to go there, unless you're in the mood for an hour walk - too cold in February, when I've",
          "We got the city bus from opposite the tourist information office and got off at Folkenparken and had a wonderful walk through the snowy forest and then we reached the Tromso Museum, at that time we had just less than an hour so the lady let us in free of charge which was a",
          "It had some interesting exhibits, but much seemed to be kid oriented. It was very hands on which could be fun, but much of it was damaged.",
          "A great Sami exhibition plus local archaeology and global changes. The aurora exhibition part very interesting. They could do with some more English guide sheets. Very limited facilities for food and drink Good cloakroom with lockers and places to hang coats. A moderate 3km",
          "Tea was only 10 nok which is probably the cheapest in the whole of Tromso. The exhibits were very interesting with local wildlife, Sami culture and the northern lights all really well explained. Great walk from Tromso round the shoreline.",
          "We liked this musuem a lot, there was a wide range of historical, natural and cultural exhibitions. The natural history of tromso was very interesting. All researched from local university. The highlight was the Northern Lights guided tour which was very informative. Well worth",
          "If you want to see the show on the Northern lights you need to book a place at least 24 hours before hand, we didn't realise this so couldn't get to see it which was a shame as that is why we went to the museum. The cafe was closed (we went on a Saturday).",
          "Interactive learning experience for kids. Why are so many exhibits written in Norwegian only? OK museum for a rainy day.",
          "Interesting learning with kids - playful methodology used - experimenting and quizzing all the way through ... leaning about evolution ... both our boys had a great time !",
          "Not to be missed! Sami culture and archeological finds in a great display. Staff very helpful and great museum shop.",
          "The museum has a number of different sections: sumi history, northern lights, man's use of fire, evolution, arctic animals. Everything is well done, professional and a number of displays are interactive. They have a number of displays at toddler height which is very sweet.",
          "This is a fascinating little museum that has great exhibits and good descriptions (also in English) of the Norwegian history. The staff are very friendly and helpful.",
          "Although this place is far from the city centre, we thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits. When we went, there were exhibits on Charles Darwin and natural selection, fire in the Stone ages and my favorite, the Tromso Palm. A real gem in the middle of nowhere.",
          "A short bus ride away from Tromso centre this is a great place to visit. Lots of local information and history to see. Great exhibits with lots of English translations. We watched a short video on the Northern Lights, beautiful shots and time sensitive scenes. Quite a few",
          "A very interesting museum reachable by a by fro the centre of Troms\u00f8. Showed a lot of the old and new time. A placed you really should visit. The service there was splendid!",
          "Very interesting about local history and culture of Noerthern Norway.The Same and religion chapter are the best parts.Also very interesting the explaining of northern lights.You can acces the museum easily by bus,but taxi to there,is expensive.I suggest it,to all Tromso visitors.",
          "A beautiful modern building, with helpful staff. Informative displays on N Norway archaeology, anthropology etc Senior tickets available (they asked us). It is a little way out of town but under an hours walk including Telegraph point (buses & taxis easy too)",
          "I really enjoyed this museum! So much information and very interactive. The Sami section and the section with the religious artefacts were my favourite. I would recommend anyone visiting Tromso make a stop at this place.",
          "Everything you wanted to know about the Sami, the early days of life in the Arctic and other bits and pieces too. Not a lot about the 20th century from 1914-1945 which might be interesting to find out about. Good interactive displays and a good shop with standard Norwegian",
          "A great museum , great for kids.We arrived and the place was closed(they had changed the opening hour to 11.00 a.m) However as would only happen in Norway, they opened up for us early. It is a distance from the centre and quite expensive by taxi.",
          "A small museum that looks at local Sami culture, rock formations, Northern lights and a few other little things. Interesting displays and it is really funny to read some of the English on the displays as they are not quite correct. For example: one display ask about",
          "As I see it, the most interesting thing to see at this museum is the explanation on how the Northern Lights occur. By all means, the museum have many different exhibitions, but if you are not particularly interested in the first place, these will not appeal to you in particular.",
          "Varied displays, allowing you to move on or linger over the displays at your own pace. A bus trip to the edges of town, a worthy addition if you are unfamiliar with this part of the world",
          "so much to see in this museum, once you find it !!Even a local didnt know where it was and had to llok it up on Google maps so a few more signs needed. However when there it is great to see with plenty of exhibits taking us around 2 hours. a self service cafe is available. get",
          "A bit if a way out of town at the Sidpissen end of town and somehwere we visitied on a relaly bad weatehr day - few nice exhibits and interesting to see how the Sami live",
          "Good exhibition on Sami life - never realised there were so many ways to trap an animal! Very good explanation of why/how Northern Lights occur, plus an exhibit which you can make your own Aurora. If visiting during the winter months I would recommend catching the local bus",
          "We visited this museum and found it very interesting a good mix of old and modern. Well worth a look if you have the time",
          "This museum does a great job of explaining the original inhabitants of the area, the Sami people (who I learned about in school as the Laplanders) with artifacts and dioramas. It also has interesting information on the Northern Lights. They also have displays of Viking culture",
          "Some great videos about how the Northern Lights work, With comprehensive displays including a copy of Kristian Birkeland's Experiment proving how they work over 100 years ago (you can make Your own Northern Lights).",

          "There was alot to see in this museum and i think is one of the best in Troms\u00f8. I took a walk from the central to the museum, it was a nice walk to see the houses on the way. On the returm journey, i took the coastal walk which is totally scenic! Please go if you have time",
          "I learned a lot at this museum. Much more than at other far more expensive ones in Troms\u00f8. There is a good selection of information and displays about evolution, which I'm not sure was always of direct relevance, but did link well to the history of settlement in the area. Lots",
          "The Tromso University Museum is well worth a visit, and I would be allowing a couple of hours minimum, There are a variety of interesting and educational displays that give a good overview of the indigenous peoples, the Sami way of life, including clothing ,housing, hunting,",
          "This museum is one of the best I've visited. The mail reason is because the permanent exhibitions are anchored in this region. The two Sami departments space over a 7000 year time lapse. The northern light section is really informative and essay to understand. The arctic",
          "The entry was fairly cheap as a student. There were a couple of new exhibits that were well presented with English information and were an excellent introduction to some of the local history and culture on my first day. Some of the older exhibits were not in English but were",
          "It is the University museum, rather poor but still interesting as gives you a genuine view of local culture and the its original inhabitant: the Sami people. A little more investment from the community would do good",

          "We decided to tour Tromso on our own and took the city bus to this museum. There is information about the artic area and the Sami people, native to the area. It is a small museum so it doesn't take long but worth a visit just to learn about the Sami.",
          "This was a fantastic museum - we spent nearly 3 hours there getting a good feel for the area. Our favourite part (father and two sons, aged 11 and 17) was meeting and talking with the young student in the Sami hut in the museum grounds. Thank you, Ulva, for taking the time to",
          "If you want to get a feel about the origins of the city of Tromso and the surrounding area, this is the best place to start. The Tromso Museum is kitted out like a traditional museum but has some modern parts with a bit of interactivity for younger and less academic visitors",

          "As a good antidote to full board on the Hurtigruten ferry the walk to the museum takes a brisk 30 minutes each way and is worth it. The explanation of the history of the Sami people and a section on the more recent history since the war is well laid out. Everything in the museum",

          "I recommend going to visit this museum. It just is all what I wanted to see in a museum. Learning about the northern lights and see how people in Norway live(d). It is 45 minutes walk out of the city center, but you can also get there by bus.",
          "On our last day in Troms\u00f8, my friend and I decided to go check out the museum scene in the city. She had heard about this place through a friend who goes to the university there. There was a Northern Lights exhibition that clearly explained how the phenomenon worked as well as",

          "We visited the Troms\u00f8 Museum after having visited Polaria & The Polar Museum. I definitely preferred this museum on the whole. The Northern Lights film was much better then the one at Polaria, featuring more detailed history surrounding the myths and legends in the old days",
          "This was worth a visit, we went as part of a Tromso tour, but I wouldn't have made a special effort to go. The displays were informative. If you are passing then pop in.",
          "This is a very interesting museum, which covers all aspects of hard life, survival and exploration in the northern arctic. Images of seal hunting might worry children but it is all very instructive.",
          "We hopped on a bus, one of the many, in Tromso and had a very pleasant trip up to the museum. The staff were very welcoming and helpful and the exhibits beautifully laid out. We particularly enjoyed the display relating to the history of the Sami people and of course the",

          "It's looks quite small but there are different exhibition in it. Check for combined tickets and family ticket. You can save some money which is always worth of it in Norway. I enjoyed very much an exhibition about Sami people living in this area in the last and today. Also",

          "It's a little outside the main town but REALLY worth the trip. Drive or take the bus. Local wildlife and climate change issues, exhibitions on the Sami people and the mystery of the body in the bog. Something for all ages - cafe and classy gift shop too.",

          "We went there in the hope of learning a lot more about the Sami culture, and we certainly did. Not sure how it works at other times, but we basically had a private class for the better part of one hour. We just walked up, and the host/guide invited us to sit down and start",

          "Troms\u00f8 Museum offers different rooms where tourists can be delighted with a excellent explanation from Northern Lights to the Sami culture back on time. Important to mention the reference to the room of Samis after the WWII, where one can get a really good impression about all",

It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

          "It was a surprise! Like Betzy contemporary exhibition is way beyond my expectations. The works are selected carefully, you can follow her life and art till the end. I did not hear of her before this visit, made me to feel her like Frida Kahlo of the North. The temporary",

          "This Northern Norway Art Museum (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) is a small museum, and needs only about one hour. The collection focusses on late 19th century and early 20th century works depicting life in the cold north of Norway. While the paintings are more than competent, none are",
          "This museum took about 2 hours to enjoy. The excellent brochure in English highlights the important works including Edvard Munch and David Hockney. The lockers provided are a great place for your backpacks and coats",

          "This museum is good if you want to see some landscapes of Northern Norway and there was a good exhibition regarding 'Betsy'. There is also a reasonable exhibition on Sami life. However, the layout of the museum is confusing and mismatched. Dates on the works would be useful. The",
          "Went when the installations were being removed/changed so it was emptier than usual. But it was smaller than I expected and if it weren't free I don't think I would've entered! There aren't many descriptions/text so it's best for those who really love art. Maybe check online to",
          "We were greeted warmly and the woman on reception explained everything for us without needing to ask. There is a free-to-use cloakroom with lockable lockers to store coats and bags, and we were provided with English guidebooks explaining the art work. This place has a really",
          "I was pleasantly surprised. It's a lovely little museum. When I was there they had an interesting special exhibition of contemporary Norwegian artists. The permanent collection has a small number of works by well-known artists. It's a good thing to do when the weather is bad.",
          "We visited the museum with kids, and the art work shown was interesting. Several sami artists have works there, this was interesting to see. The rest is ok.",
          "Very nicely curated museum of mixed media modern art, but don't expect the Gemaldgalerie, a pleasant 45 minutes is not to be sniffed at.",
          "I guess I didn't do my research well. I expected a little more paintings, so this museum wasn't quite my thing. But if you are interested in northern Norwegian art in all different styles, this museum is absolutely worth a visit. Oh, and it's free!",
          "Went to this on one of our off days. It has some really impressive art throughout and given its free entry and lovely staff id highly suggest you make the trip.",

          "On the first floor there were two separate pieces of art or something that was just a circular pile of dirt. One had clear boxes surrounding it with God knows inside them. The rest are a few pictures and some hanging craft work. It got me out the rain for 10 minutes maximum and",
          "I visited this museum because of the reviews it had on trip advisor, and I was not disappointed! This visit is a cool cultural activity where you can see paintings, sculptures, and different forms of art, participate in workshops and more! It is always nice when you get inspired",

          "This is not Louvre or Hermitage. That's for sure. But I don't think this is a place for killing time when you have bad weather in Tromso either. Make a proper stop and you will enjoy it. It's in the city center and free anyway. It will take 1 hour max to enjoy the collection",

          "Its for free- that's first! And its absolutely amazing. Its rather small museum, but with really beautiful art. It will take less than an hour too see everything few times, but you will leave with this feeling inside that you saw something..else, maybe even insipiring. And stuff",
          "Really enjoyed this art museum because they mixed all kinds of Norwegian art of different epoch together so there is something for everyone. It's also not so big so it's good for people like me who cannot spend many hours in museums. On top of it, it's free, too.",
          "A nice chance to duck into Norwegian and northern art. A curious collection of varied works of art, all for free. Right size to not get too tired and surely everyone will find something to relate to as the three floors display exhibits of plenty of genres.",

          "Tromso is an expensive place to visit so we were excited to find an activity that was free. The museum is small but it's excellent and I would definitely recommend popping in for a quick visit. I think it only took us 30 - 45 visits top experience.",
          "Just to kill some time we went to this art museum close to our hotel and finished in less than 1hr . There is free coffee/tea and few colouring pens and papers for kids to engage with.",

          "The new museum director is really ambitious and very happy that both locals and tourists are visiting the exhibition that presents Sami art (until April 2017). I look forward to explore the upcoming program and was impressed by the diverse media and inspiring works of art",

          "I visited the museum on a snowy afternoon and found that it had been converted for a period into a display devoted entirely to the Sami people and culture of northern Scandinavia. This was very rewarding and well-presented with some gorgeous paintings, glassware and textiles on",
          "At the moment the gallery is dedicated to Sami art which is fascinating. Unfortunately all the other Norwegian Art has been put away.",
          "This is an amazing museum. Beautiful interiors and the art works are very well curated. Small exhibition but nice",
          "This is an amazing museum hundreds of kms north of the arctic circle! Beautiful interiors and the art works are very well curated. Bravo!!",

          "It was disappointing to be immobile in Tromso for four days in December, when we should have been sailing on a 50th anniversary trip on the Hurtigruten up to Kirkenes, near the border with Russia. We first did this voyage over Christmas and New Year 1966/67! And it made",
          "Mostly closed for renovations. All we could see were some (quite good) marbles of human figures. Warm. Free to enter. Pleasant young man on the desk. The guide books suggest there is a lot of interesting pieces to see.",
          "Nothing to see as the exhibits were being changed; check first to see if all rooms and floors are open otherwise stay away! Grim pictures and dubious sculptures.",

          "Expecting some excellent Norwegian paintings only to find most of exhibition closed to visitors despite galleries full of paintings the other side of a rope enclosure.",
          "Do not miss this gallery. Definitely worth a while to spend with local art. The landscapes pictures are magnificent. It located near the center and close to cost. So right after the gallery you have possibility to se the real landscape on your own :)",
          "This museum has a very nice permanent collection of paintings and sculpture by Norwegian and Scandinavian artists, and a rotating exhibit space that currently has a fascinating sculpture presentation.",
          "The Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum was high up on my list of places to visit in Troms\u00f8 after seeing the Peder Balke exhibition at the National Gallery in London last year. The Balke paintings form part of the permanent exhibition on the second floor along with some other great seascapes",
          "This a free fee museum which is a good thing! We loved the choice of the temporary exhibitions! The first floor shows more traditional paintings which are very nice as well. We recommend it!",
          "Right in the middle of town, so easy to get to. Free entry and (when visited) uncrowded, so able to view at own pace. Would allow up to two hours for visit. Visited in November so the biggest plus - it's warm!",
          "A small gallery with interesting expositions. It's for free and if you are interested in art, you should make a quick stop here. At least you can warm up here!",
          "Some areas were under renovation in mid November but still worth the visit if you have time in tromso. Free lockers and great location. Enjoy the art pieces with simple description not too lengthy for tired light chasers. Free visit and the service staff was nice and friendly!",
          "This is a small gallery that has a great permanent exhibition which gives a great sense of how tough the environment is. I loved the Otto Sinding paintings, they are very alive and compelling. He lived 1842-1909 alla feels very contemporary. Great modern art as well.",
          "This is a great little museum, located a short walk from the harbour. It has some interesting recent and historic pieces that will give you insights into life and art in Norway, past and present. The building is also of interest having been converted from a post office and other",

          "Was small but had free entry. I really enjoyed looking at some of the modern work and the landscapes, they were great! The still lives and religious work were nothing too special. Over all, the visit didn't take long, the gallery was well presented, staff were friendly and as an",

          "We loved the historic paintings of the north, especially of Lofoten, and the thematic connection through the work. Staff were very friendly. The museum is not too large, and the best pieces are worth walking by twice. It is a good companion experience to the Polar Museum,",
          "This is a gem of a small museum! They have an excellent collection of the great Norwegian artists -- Dahl, Munch, Sohlberg, Tidemand , Bakker -- and changing chi its of cntmporary art, I would recommend they Create cards of their own collected works for their tiny gift shop.",
          "On a rainy day there rarely is a better place than a free museum. The collection is small enough to understand. 30 minutes and you have been fed with a good dose of local art.",
          "The museum is right next to the Tourist Information Centre. We did not expect much, but we really blown away by the place and its contents. The building itself is amazing. Very traditional outside, clean, modern Scandinavian style inside. The ground floor holds changing",
          "Cute little museum, but a bit boring maybe. Cannot compare to the big museums of this world, but it gives you a nice little impression of northern norwegian art. Good for a rainy afternoon.",
          "We walked past it on the way to Tromso Visitor\u2019s Centre and decided to have a quick look but we ended up spending almost 2 hours at this small museum! I\u2019m not a fan of modern art pieces on show during our visit (apart from the lone Munch\u2019s work \u201cParisian Model\u201d we spotted), but",
          "We called into the Kunstmuseum and were delighted with the selection on show. Strangely we had seen some of the pictures on a new BBC programme about Scandinavian Art the week before.",

          "This is free to the public and the staff were so helpful and friendly. Some beautiful paintings and some very different to what you see in other galleries. well worth a visit.",
          "For a small provincial museum this really is a gem. There are some wonderful paintings of Arctic Norwegian scenes alongside some striking modern art. Add this to welcoming, English speaking staff and it is very well worth a visit.",
          "We visited the Gallery / Museum for a second time if only to marvel at the works of the German Artist Adelsteen Normann who painted widely in this area and on / around the Lofoton Islands. There are two main floors one for contemporary Art which we did not go to having a",
          "Free! And can you say that about much in Norway? This is simply an \"old fashioned\" museum/gallery where you can see paintings displayed in the normal way. I confess that other than E Munch I could not name another Norwegian artist. They have one of his paintings + a",
          "This is a relatively small museum. There are three floors with art on each level. It wasn't an amazing collection but it's a nice building with some good pieces with a friendly reception. Since admission was free, there's not reason not to go. Nice visit.",
          "The museum owns modern and classic art objects. Personally, I like classic art better than modern art, but because there is no admittance fee this museum is worth a visit anyhow. It is not a large museum, so don't expect you can spend hours on a rainy day. Nice local paintings.",

          "1st floor collection most impressive depicting Norway\u2019s beautiful landscapes. Small souvenir shop. Very helpful and welcoming staff. Free admission",
          "I enjoyed the Art museum in Tromso a lot, I particularly liked the paintings of old Samii culture, and all the national romantic pieces inspired by the Northern Norwegian nature... I wish there was more though! It\u00b4s a fairly small gallery, nice collection, on the first floor",
          "Very friendly welcome - we were offered a free coffee on arrival! A mix of modern (not my taste) and classic art, some of which were amazing. Also some great views across the water to be had.",
          "We visited here on a whim and were not disappointed. The paintings depicting Northern Norwegian landscapes are stunning, one in particular we could not stop looking at, it sucked you in as though you were there. Even if not a huge fan of art give this place a visit as you cant",
          "My favorite museum in Troms\u00f8. A good combination of classic and ultra modern art gives a good overview of Norwegian art. The first floor is the classic collection with great paintings covering of course, the life, working enviroment and living conditions from the 18th, 19th,",
          "This art museum was free. Unfortunately there was not a lot to see due to closed and changing exhibits. There are some good oil paintings of Nordic life and scenery. Very nice permanent collection of paintings and some contemporary items. There are a couple of oil paintings by",

          "I was expecting a much bigger museum. Indeed, the week I was in Troms\u00f8, one exhibition was just finished and one other floor was closed, so just one floor left to visit. High quality art, I discovered artists like Eilif Peterssen for example but I left a bit hungry for more.",
          "Charming little gallery, containing some lovely paintings of local and other nordic scenes. There are also some portraits, including a couple by Munch ( of the Scream fame). Many of the paintings are exceptionally well lit.",
          "This is a free museum right in the middle of town. The second story holds the permanent exhibits, which were the most interesting in our opinion (the itinerant show on the retreat of the Red Army was sort of wierd). From classic depictions of life and scenes of northern Norway",
          "We wondered around the museum and saw some lovely paintings of nordic landscapes. The staff are wonderful and friendly and helped my wife with the books to choose. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It was free. Has several floors and a store. Had some interesting paintings of differing types. The staff is uber friendly and helpful.",

          "It is a nice museum with a good collection of paintings. The show rooms are spacious and peaceful. And it is free",
          "Definitely an admirable collection of paintings and sculptures. If you're into this kind of stuff, this place is totally recommended. Most paintings are depictions of Norsk lifestyle or the landscape around Tromso. Impressive pieces for sure.",
          "A wide range of styles and eras to see made this all the more interesting. We spent a fascinated hour plus, here!",
          "I spent an hour wandering round this art gallery admiring the range of art on show - there was a range of style from classic to contemporary set out over 3 floors.",
          "This museum is the proof that Troms\u00f8 isn't just a little town at the end of the world. There is so many beautiful paintings to see, some by Much himself ! My favorites though are the numerous national-Romantic paintings of North-Norway. They are absolutely magnificent. You must",
          "Modern art and lots of gorgeous landscapes and seascapes. If the weather is bad, it's great place to escape the cold. But it's a great place to visit all year round.",
          "This wonderful museum a block away from where the Hurtigruten ship docked. It is free and excellent. It contains three Munch's and a large collection of Norwegian artists, including Normann, Sinding and Baade. We sent a wonderful hour visiting this venue while our ship was",

          "Wonderful museum that hosts a great collection of paintings from local artists, beautiful masterpieces from the XIX Century through contemporary ones. Interesting subjects of life in northern Norway, these artists have their own voice, well worth visiting it. It\u00b4s centrally",
          "Notable painters from northern Norway are displayed here, in a fine building by the harbor and the bus depot. Definitely worth a visit, free admission!",
          "Excellent art gallery specialising in the art of Nortern Norway. Holds visiting exhibitions but it's core collection shows many places of the region and how they challenged artists to represent them. Do not miss the brass tap elephants in the stairwell, they raise a smile!",
          "A collection of art from the great national artists to contemporary international paintings and objects. Small, but with an unusual and interesting collection; you will find a Hockney as well!",
          "This provincial art museum would not perhaps catch the interest of tourists but they would be making a mistake in skipping this surprisingly good art museum. There is a rather comprehensive collection of local art, all donated by a local lawyer who was also an art collector.",
          "Excellent museum. Great history and interesting exhibits. Very well worth a visit. Recommend a visit and not to me mssed. Set over several floors it has an net resting array of tableaux and stuffed animals with interactive sections.",
          "I visited the museum with two pre-teenage children. They were determinedly unimpressed (\"I could have painted that,\" etc) but I enjoyed our visit. I particularly liked the early 20th century tapestries by Gerhard Munthe hung on the ground floor of the museum and the 19th century",
          "This place was a big surprise for me, I had probably done ny homework too briefly before going to Troms\u00f8. In more than one sense, we lost the bus and had to wait six hours on the next. Near the bus station (and tourist information) we found the local Art Museum, and went in for",

Located in the city of Troms\u00f8, Norway, it was established in 1968, and opened in 1972. It is one of eight universities in Norway. The University of Troms\u00f8 is the largest research and educational institution in northern Norway. The University's location makes it a natural venue for the development of studies of the region's natural environment, culture, and society.\nThe main focus of the University's activities is on auroral light research, space science, fishery science, biotechnology, linguistics, multicultural societies, Saami culture, telemedicine, epidemiology and a wide spectrum of Arctic research projects. The close vicinity of the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research and the Polar Environmental Centre gives Troms\u00f8 added weight and importance as an international centre for Arctic research. Research activities, however, are not limited to Arctic studies. The University researchers work within a broad range of subjects and are recognised both nationally and internationally.\nOn 1 January 2009, the University of Troms\u00f8 merged with Troms\u00f8 University College. On 1 August 2013, the university merged with Finnmark University College to form Universitetet i Troms\u00f8 \u2013 Norges arktiske universitet (The University of Troms\u00f8 \u2013 The Arctic University of Norway), thereby adding campuses in Alta, Hammerfest and Kirkenes. On 1 January 2016, Narvik University College and Harstad University College merged with UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.

          "Spent a couple of hours here and had a blast. The exhibits were great, interactive and fun. Staff amazing and helpful. Planetarium was good. Went to the university food hall and grabbed a bite to eat while waiting for our planetarium time. Great looking university.",
          "The planetarium has an outstanding show on the Northern Lights. The rest of the museum is informative & has great interactive exhibits. This is a great place to go!",
          "Really interesting museum with some great interactive exhibitions to try out. The film in the planetarium is worth watching.",
          "The interactive exhibits were really good - engaging and informative, and all working! The Northern Lights film in the planetarium featured breathtaking auroral displays. A must for visitors to Troms\u00f8.",
          "Great hands on activities and a great showing of \"Extreme Auroras\". Worth the visit. Try to go before you go out Northern Lights hunting, it will give you a realistic perspective.",
          "Oriented more toward children, the interactive exhibits are nonetheless fun and challenging for adults too. We never did figure out the three-ring puzzle. No doubt some smart child could do it right away. The planetarium\u2019s film on the northern lights was interesting but, again,",
          "We took a bus from city centre to the science museum - the exhibits are fun for children(we had age 4 &13 - both enjoyed it) and the planetarium show is good. Downside is there is no cafe (that we could find) and we ended up having muffins from shop & vending machine coffee",
          "This is a great museum with lots of fun things to do for kids and adults. Lots of things to learn!! And the film in the planetarium about the extreme auroras was awesome! If you have children, they will love it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll love it as well!",
          "If you need an inside activity this is fantastic, I went with my 15 year old and she loved it. Great for kids and adults alike, also the planetarium show was lovely and relaxing. Go even if it's not raining/snowing!",
          "This was included on our Astronomy cruise so we had the whole place to ourselves (about 75 of us) which allowed us to see the planetarium show and have plenty of time to look at the science exhibits. There are some really interesting and highly educational items that are mainly",
          "What a great day out, come in, hang up you coat, play with the Lego & get started. Northern lights show wasn\u2019t until 2pm, so we spent the morning doing the interactive activities which were very stimulating & relevant to the environment & how it all works. Popped over to the",
          "I was impressed with my visit. In the planetarium the northern light show was excellent. The seats were great and recline. Situated at the top of the hill, so great photo opportunities!",
          "I was part of a group visiting from Hurtigruten while the ship was in Troms\u00f8. The visit isn't on the standard list of excursions, but was included in our 'Astronomy and Aurora' package. I was a bit disappointed that the first presentation in the planetarium was about the myths",
          "Educational and interactive exhibits, as well as interesting films. Recommended for children, most exhibits are aimed at 5-15 year olds.",
          "We watched the Northern Lights film in the panoramic cinema and it made us realise what a brilliant experience we had seeing the real thing. There are lots of great activities for children (an adults who still have a sense of fun). We walked from the city centre and it is not",
          "Lots of interactive displays for both adult and children. Lots of fun. The aurora film was great too.",
          "We went to see the Aurora movie, primarily. It is beautiful, but at 30 minutes it's a bit long. It was mostly eye candy. The science center is very hands on, but we mostly were just playing around until it was film time, and we didn't go back afterwards. It was rather empty",
          "It explains northern lights. Tromso and the stars. It is for families . It is good way to spend a wet afternoon .",
          "Although some of the exhibits were clearly aimed at the younger visitors I still enjoyed trying them out.",
          "There is lots to have a go with at this science centre so let your inner child out and have a go. We spent a good few hours here and enjoyed every minute. We also learnt a bit as well. It was as little further out of the centre than most places but th e bus stops right outside",
          "My husband and visited here for an afternoon on our recent trip to Tromso. I would say it is definitely geared towards children and families but that is not to say we did not learn anything! It was very quiet when we visited on a Sunday afternoon which made the atmospehere a bit",
          "A well organized planetarium where you learn with fun. There are two floors filled with lots of small activities primarily aimed for kids however we enjoyed it refreshing what we studied in school and also learning new things. If you are tired, you may relax at the seating area",
          "We spent a few hours here, and although the science centre is aimed at a much younger audience, we're young at heart and in our 30's and had great fun!!! There is an English language video about the Aurora Borealis on the 4th floor and the first and second floor are hands-on",
          "great for all ages! our children are 2-11 years old. Very entertaining and a good place to learn....",
          "The advertising stated that there would be daily shows of the Northern lights. However, when I was there, the planetarium was closed because a group booked it (although I did neither see nor hear anyone). The whole way for nothing... Disappointing",
          "We were part of a tour group from a cruise ship. Everyone enjoyed the movie of the northern lights. The theater is a 360 degree dome with reclining seats. NOTE: photos are NOT allowed during the movie.",
          "We went on Dec 29th and it was close to the university and adjacent botanical garden. This is science museum though a small one compared to london standards but well worth it. Kids just loved it and we stayed till the closing time 4PM from 11AM. There are legos to play with",
          "Its a very interactive science museum and we had fun trying everything out! We went during a weekday and it wasn\u2019t too busy. You get free lockers to keep your bags/coats in. You also get student discount so take your card or show your app. Again, staff very friendly (as with",
          "The interactive science center/museum is worth a visit. It's fun for kids and for adults (who are still kids :)) alike. It's a good way to learn the principles of science, physics and nature. The Northern Lights show in the dome shaped auditorium is also top notch.",
          "4 floors of hands-on learning. The climate, energy, forces, your brain, the stars, food miles - all covered in a great environment where you learn by playing with the exhibits. There's a climbing wall, a human hamster wheel to create energy, a boat/sledge/bike race,",
          "It was a nice visit to this most northern planetarium in the world. The staff was kind enough to let us see a show the aurora boreal is, even after the closing time.",
          "Much knowledge is presented here in varieties of activities and exhibitions. Learn about northern lights, the arctic climate, electricity, avalanches.... there's so much to do here! I highly recommend watching the movie in the planetary about northern lights; it's available in",
          "Interesting and fun for the whole family. The kids loved it. Bring your own lunch since there is not much to buy.",
          "Nice dome theatre with northern lights show. Easy to find location but public parking quite a long walk away",
          "The center itself is worth seeing. If you walk to the center via Dramsvegen you will be treated to very nice views of the city.",
          "A place to learn a lot about science, by playing and doing. For small and big kids a great place to learn, and enjoy. Also a nice planetarium.",
          "The best part of this center is the Planetarium that explained (through documentary) the northern lights phenomenon. You will get a better picture of northern lights. You are recommended to visit this planet if you want to know more about northern lights. As for the science",
          "cold afternoon we decide to visit the centre, not expensive at all is a nice place to understand something about Science better than school. nothing special but nice the \"all around\" cinema where you can see how the northern light are.",
          "We went here as we wanted an indoor activity. We were surprised how good it was. It's well geared up for children, but also good for adults. There is no food available, and very limited hot drinks available from a machine. Best to take your own food. It was a good 1-2 hours",
          "We were in Tromso for the weekend and thought we would check out the 'Science Centre'. We were sorely disappointed. It is great for families and we were surrounded by them. I feel the museum posed more questions than it did answers. It did try answer these questions by through",
          "Excellent place to go with kids, we could have spent so mich more time there. We will definitely go back again soon.",
          "We took the walking route on the visitor map.....not the greatest walk in icy conditions through the industrial side of the city ! And no signposting so we struggled to find it even after asking people - most of whom did not know it. Anyway once we got there we found that",
          "Usually \"hands-on\" museums filled with children are also filled with broken equipment, computer stations that don't work, etc. But this had everything up and running. We learned a lot, and the kids enjoyed the science exhibits. The northern lights film in the planetarium was",
          "Plenty of interesting and educational interactive exhibits, puzzles and games. Planetarium show was good too. We had a lot of fun for two grown-ups.",
          "We went to the Science Center again today to try to see the Northern Lights show in the Planetarium. Their computer was down yesterday, so no show. There were a number of fun interactive things to do here. It is a great place to help children learn about science (adults too!).",
          "A very good display of the Northern Lights on the planetarium screen. If you go, try to sit in the back for the best view. The chairs are comfortable for the viewing and they recline to give a good view. Also worth seeing are the interactive displays in other parts of the",
          "Enjoyed n afternoon visit to the museum, combined with a walk round the botanical gardens which are close by. perhaps best suited to younger children than our thirteen year old daughter, nonetheless many interactive displays which even adults could enjoy. The aurora film was",
          "Great place to indoor experience in Troms\u00f8. I've been there and the movie about Northern Lights is great, the experiences and everything. Kids have their space as adults to play and discovery science in a very fun way. Truly recommended.",
          "A lovely museum, especially the northern lights movie. A great place not only for kids but for everyone who is into science, northern lights and astronomy. A really nice Botanical Garden nearby, I really recommend this museum if you have some spare time in Tromso. The museum",
          "Great for kids and adults alike. It surprised us that such good science museum can be located in so small town - most likely it's better than the one in Bergen. Kids will really enjoy, adults too. There is also a cinema displaying northern lights and space journey movie. Great",
          "I have been here several times, and my son loves it. I would recomend this for familyes with children from about 3 years and up. Everyone can learn something here, this is a good way to get kids excited about science. I wish they would vary their excebitions more.",
          "Visited the centre whilst on a winter break with my husband. We paid too much for what is worth,a lot of the machine to use for experimenting were broken and the Northern Lights show in the Planetarium is only one at 15.30.We went in the morning so no show but there was no",
          "You can walk or you can take the bus - its up to you. Its a bit far away from the city center. Its more suitable for kids, but adults can find interesting things there as well like the northern lights lift - 4th floor. I did the mistake for not checking when the northern lights",
          "This is a really interesting and even fun place especially for children between 5 and 12 years ( also for adults) as it is possible to see and test different scientific issues and phenomena by own hands.",
          "Situated on Tromso University campus (bus 20 or 21 from central Tromso). The Northern Lights show is usually once a day at 15:15hrs which is the main attraction. Interesting planetarium building, both inside and outside, with quite a few functional exhibits on the northern",
          "The name \"Science Centre\" might not seem immediately attractive to visitors to Tromso but it is well worth the bus fare from the centre of Tromso! The bus stops at the entrance to the building which is part of the University of Tromso complex and is easily recognisable by the",
          "Great all round museum, planets, global warming, weights etc. Lots of interactive things to do. No cafe but you can buy a coffee from the machine for 20kr. Spent a few hours without realsing it as we had so much fun playing and learning. Our kids 13 and 11 loved it. Parking",
          "Our 12 year old who is increasingly hard to impress had great fun here and do did we. A great way to spend a few hours when the Arctic wind is blowing outside. I was most impressed by the way that each experiment linked in to the local area. Very knowledgeable staff.",
          "So we came here because I wanted to understand more about the Northern Lights. The show is at 3.15pm every day. It's quite a trek to come out here and given the weather we just took a taxi here and a bus back.  So there is a science museum here which would be great for kids.",
          "The first thing we did when touching down in Tromso was head to the Vitensenter to watch the Northern Lights video! It was gorgeous and we learned a lot.",
          "I can't understand anything scientific, yet this center made me interested in a whole lot of things I never cared about before. Plus their 360 degrees cinema is majestic !",
          "We had a rainy day so we took the boys (6,10) to the science centre to explore. Although there are 4 floors to the building, in reality there are only 2. You enter from the fourth floor but the tickets and main floor are on the second floor, where you also have the stairs to the",
          "Nordnorsk Vitensenter is definitely a \"must\" if you're in Tromso. A lot of funny instruments help you and your kids to discover the laws of nature. They have a very good film about the northern lights as well.",
          "Went here with a 5 and 10 year old boys. Lots of hand on science displays. Interactive environment makes being at a science center fun for the whole family!",
          "A good selection of activity stations, some I had not seen elsewhere. Rather too much focus on global warming. Good and reasonably priced selection of science toys in the shop. Note: Check the times of filmshows at the planetarium, we arrived at opening time 11AM and there",
          "The 360 degree Northern light show was excellent and the various scientific and puzzle displays while aimed at children were also excellent for our group of adults!!",
          "We emjoyed this museum, though it is geared more towards children with interesting interactive exhibits fun for everyone. The planetarium offers different movies including a documentary on filming the Northern Lights which we found to be very interesting.",
          "We live here and we still occassionally visit the place for various reasons, such as we just happened to pass by or birthdays. My kids have been there severeal times and they still love it. Educational and something resembling an amusement park (since tromso does not have its",
          "Having been to a few Science museums before I enjoyed this but it is hard to compare with bigger, better ones. When we first arrived it was very quiet and easy for us to take full advantage of the hands on experiences. Some were good while others didn't work or weren't very",
          "The aurora movie in the planetarium is really worth seeing. That's recommended! But maybe a bit too expensive with 100,- NOK admission in addition to bus to get there. It says in the ads that the rest of the science center is fun for all ages. Well, all ages up to 10 years",
          "If you bring children to Troms\u00f8 or if you are interested in science this is a great place to go. Located by the University and the botanical garden.",
          "Absolutely tremendous. We spent 3 hours here and ended up missing the botanical gardens, which is right next food, cos we were so exhausted from the science museum. The best bit was all the kids having such a great time. I include us 55+ kids.",
          "I have been some times in the scientific center with my kids and they always love it. There are lots of activities programed specially for the young ones. The kinder gardens use to visit often and with good reason. There are things to do for both kids and grown ups.",
          "Lots of interesting things to play with and interactive science experiments. But my favorite thing was the Aurora movie. After unsuccessfully Northern Lights hunting in Iceland and Norway, I finely had my share :-) Big thanks to the guys that spent several months in cold and",
          "Vitensenteret is locating near the University of Troms\u00f8, therefore you could also visit the university if you have spare time. Inside Vitensenteret there are lot of action games to show you the theories and logics, it is great place for kids, but we also have lots of fun trying",
          "What a spectacular film show! The main reason for our trip to Troms\u00f8 was to experience the Northern Lights and a visit to Norway's largest planetarium was a fantastic introduction! It was snowy and cold outside but lovely and warm inside. The planetarium is upstairs but there is",
          "Our main reason for visiting the centre was to see the Aurora film in the planetarium but there are lots of other fun interactive exhibits. Although these are mostly aimed at kids as educational resources they can be fun for all ages to play with. If you arrive by car you can",
          "I went there with my 3y/o, and he had the time of his life. Lots of amazing new things that you never see elsewhere. There are brain teasers, hands-on educational games, Legos, etc. Children get to move and play while also learning new things and concepts (eg causal relations;",
          "By chance, our bus stopped right outside and it was snowing so we visited the museum earlier than we had planned and I am so pleased we did! We all enjoyed the different genres of art on display and even for those less interested, it was a very manageable size!",
          "The planetarium Aurora Borealis time lapse show is daily at 15:15 with an extra show on Saturday at 12:15 is the best in town. The rest of the exhibits cater for school parties.",
          "If you visit a lot of science museums like I do, this one is a bit disappointing. Granted, they don't have the level of tourism that large, international destination cities get, so they can't afford/justify cutting-edge exhibits. Still, if you're pressed for something to do",
          "My husband and I enjoy our visit to the science centre very much. We got to play with all the interesting apparatus, puzzles and fun science experiments. The experiments allow you to get your heart pumping ('ski' stimulator, human-hamster wheel) as well as get your brain working",
          "You can enjoy film, guided Experiments, or walk around in the large building, to try all sorts of fun and amazing interactive installations, giving practical knowledge about nature, mathematics, physics and science.",
          "Many cool things to do and to see! I'm kinda lazy to describe this place, but I liked it much, so why not visiting?",
          "We had a business reception there and also went through the show floors. They are more for the kids, but actually provide interesting information for the adults, too.",
          "My wife and I visited in late September 2014, and left very disappointed. We were traveling on Hurtigruten, had limited time in Tromso, and in hindsight mistakenly chose to visit the Northern Lights show. The Visitor Center informed us the next show was to start at 14:15. We",
          "A gallery that was free, so we decided to spend some time before boarding our boat. The art work was all fairly dark and bleak which showed what life is like in this area. Worth a visit to help understand this area.",
          "This is good for kids as most of the exhibits are meant for kids and to do with scientific principles. If you have a large groups of kids below the age group 12, do not miss to visit",
          "We went mainly to see the northern lights show in the planetarium, but took the time to look around. It is mainly an exploratory aimed at children, but has some interesting attractions such as the globe where you can align pins to show the Earth's magnetic field. One weakness",
          "Our cruise ship was running a tour here but we did it ourselves as the Science Centre was within walking distance of the cruise ship. We went to the northern lights presentation at the planetarium, made us even more sure we want to go back in northern lights season. Once we",
          "OK, I will cut to the chase. I went to this place in the afternoon, paid the entrance fee, and asked the attendant where I should start. He waved his hand vaguely down the hall, so I went that way and looked around for a while. About half an hour later, since there are NO",
          "We made a Sunday stop at this facility while on a ship's tour - so our two buses were the entire audience. The planetarium has reclining seats and the show about the northern lights has background information presented in an interesting fashion. We were really glad to have had",
          "A good idea to promote interest in science for kids and grownups alike, but a lot of the stations need repair. The same can be said for the geological and botanical path outside: owergrown and unmaintained:(",
          "We went for their planetarium show on Northern light as we get no chance to see during summer. But the entire science museum with their novel displays and interactive experience are worth spending time. In Tromso you get good buses to take you around, hence reaching here was not",
          "Good to spend 3-4 hours here, and play some of the games they have. Kids will definitely like this place, while adults can feel young again being here. They have an omni theater and have shows scheduled all day. We watched the documentary about Aurora Borealis here and it felt",
          "Most of the people visiting Tromso in the winter come to see the Aurora Borealis. You need to have a lot of luck though (weather, solar activity etc.). Well, in any case, by visiting Vitenssenteret (Science museum), you are guaranteed to experience the Northern Lights, albeit",

          "This is what science centres should be like for kids, loads of things to press, hold, throw and work out how things work. My 6 year old loved this and actually so did the adults! from the northern light show to trying to spin the big hamster wheel and trying to make electricity!",

          "A reasonable place to visit, especially if it is wet or very cold!! We went particularly to see the planetarium and the Aurora Screening, which was so- so; perhaps we were expecting better and so were a little disappointed at almost \u00a39 each.",

          "This was great fun! If you are a big kid at heart then this place is for you! Lots of activities to show basic science principles. I also loved the Planetarium, which has a 25 minute video of the Aurora, well worth a visit!"

          "I knew a little of the history prior to going in. The had a booklet in English so that we could follow the exhibits in a logical way. It really added to what I knew. The exhibit itself was beautiful with great artefacts, dioramas and photos.",

          "We had high hopes for this museum, but unfortunately left a bit disappointed. It was a bit heavy going and the fact the English version was in a very word-heavy booklet you had to read separately made it less accessible. It was actually cheap for Norway but in hindsight we",
          "We visited the Polar Museum while on a trip to Troms\u00f8. It was very informative and even I had an interest in such stuff I have learnt so much through this. Anyone complaining about the past being harsh and cruel, well that is a part of it. We spent good two hours in this place",

          "There\u2019s a lot of artefacts packed into this museum and it\u2019s a great way to explore the history of the area since human habitation/exploration. The stories of different families who lived here give a personal touch to what can be a fairly bloody affair. There\u2019s a lot to read and",
          "A very nice museums with a lot of information. There are a lot of polar animals. It is an middle of the city. Recommend.",
          "The history on display in the museum is fascinating and you'll learn a lot. The exhibits are quite date, and there's perhaps only so much polar history the casual visitor can take...",
          "Really enjoyed walking around! Learned a lot about not just the history of Norway but about the history behind the polar expedition!",
          "Museum served as a quick break from all of the outdoor Troms\u00f8 activities. Smallish but interesting review of the history in the area. A lot of coverage of seal and whale killing which was a bit of a downer, but accurate representation of what was happening i suppose. Pretty",
          "Worth a short visit . A mixed collection some of stuffed animals and a section on one of my heroes , the polar explorer Roald Amundsen",
          "Don\u2019t be fooled by the modest exterior of this fantastic place in Troms\u00f8, this lovely museum just keeps expanding as you wander through. There is a strong depiction of the historical dependence upon hunting, this being reflected in lots of taxidermy \u2013 not to everyone\u2019s",
          "Really informative. Enjoyed it! Good to learn the history of polar exploration. Entrance is 70 kroner but you can pay to visit the other museum too for an extra 30 kroner.",
          "I was really surprised about the quality of this museum. It\u2019s a big quirky, but I found the exhibits about the polar explorations really interesting. Probably a 90 minute distraction on a snowy day.",
          "Very interesting and well resourced. Information well set out and in different languages. Even my daughters found it acceptable \ud83d\udc4d",
          "This is a proper old school museum but worth a trip if you\u2019re in Troms\u00f8. My recommendation is just to head to the upstairs section where it tells you the story of the explorers. By far the most interesting section of the whole museum and a truly fascinating story. You can do a",
          "Visited with my adult son. Found it more interesting than I thought I would. Many negative reviews about glorifying the killing of seals, polar bears, whaling etc. I didn\u2019t see it this way but as being factual about the history of what went on in the area. I did find it hard",
          "Such an interesting museum with films and objects, stories , the zeppelins and Amundson life, loads of things totally unknown to me thanks",
          "Great museum with detailed information about the navy culture, tradition and history of Norway! In the entrance they offer you a guide book (available in several languages) which will guide you along the visit!",
          "I visited in March of 2019 and found the museum very interesting and learned alot about the Arctic. It was snowing most of the day I visited so this was a good way to spend the day indoors.",
          "A very interesting museum, with loads of different displays ranging from the hunting techniques used through to information about all the explorers.",
          "Despite being relatively small, this is a very good museum tightly focused on the topic of explorations of the seas and islands further north such as Svalbard. Using various artefacts and contemporaneous records, Polar Museum reveals, in a nutshell, the history of seal hunting,",
          "This relatively small museum had lots of fascinating artifacts. Would highly recommend if you have a few hours to spare.",
          "Visited recently and took approx 1.5 hours to visit all the exhibits. found it most interesting. learnt about the explorers and the way they prepared for their expeditions. also learnt about the animals in the area. everything was so well explained in English .",
          "If you have an hour to kill, the polar museum is a great place to spend it. Lots of interesting artifacts, history of the North and stories to tell. Was a different time then and you can see it via the stories and activities shared.",
          "The Polar Museum is a thought provoking place to visit. I recommend combining it with a visit to Polaria, to get a balanced view of the Norwegian attitude to the Arctic. The Polar Museum details mainly the activities of various people who hunted, trapped, killed and skinned",
          "It\u2019s a cute museum that gives context to the area of Norway. If you don\u2019t know who Roald Amundsen is, you should look him up before going to Norway as he\u2019s a maritime legend and he launched his last expedition from Tromso.",
          "Terrific way to spend an hour or two. My husband enjoyed the history of the early expeditions and I was riveted by photos and personal stories from those who overwintered.",
          "Very interesting museum on the Arctic explorers and inhabitants. It is definitely worth a visit. Free wi-fi inside if you want to check for further info during your visit.",
          "The polar museum is very interesting to learn about how people use to live, the big bussines hunting bacame to the area. And about the research of the North Pole, not an easy task. If you like history is a must.",
          "Not grand, not dominating. But so well set up and so interesting, at least for people interested in polar travel and in Norwegian nation building.",
          "It's a nice little museum with a good exhibition about hunting in Scandinavia. If you have enough time, check it out.",
          "A short walk from the Hurtigruten Terminal, the museum provided a great opportunity to shelter from the inclement weather. The museum is bigger than it looks and has rooms devoted to hunting whales, seals and polar bears. There is also an extensive exhibition on Roald",
          "Great museum that is bigger than it looks. It has a booklet which describes all the exhibits in English and covers lots of different parts of life in the Polar regions. I would recommend looking around this museum, especially if it\u2019s snowing outside as it\u2019s a great way to warm",
          "A great insight into polar exploration and the history of this region. Allow at least 1.5hrs and there is a lot to see and interact with. Some good English translated exhibits but an English guide book is available for you to use from reception for free, just return it at the",
          "Not sure what to expect when we went to this museum to get out of the rain, but it was so interesting to learn about Norway's role in polar exploration and tales of survival. Great hands-on exhibits. Would definitely recommend.",
          "The Polarmuseet or Polar museum displays parts of the polar history of Troms\u00f8 ranging from the history of whaling, polar bear hunting and seal hunting, but also explorers such als Amundsen that tried to reach the North Pole. Some of the displays looks fairly modern, others",
          "If you have time it is worth to visit the Polarmuseum in Troms\u00f8. For us it was very interesting to learn about the expeditions.",
          "Amazing details in the museum, the artifacts are all in set in a building that could have been built hundreds od years ago, really took you back",
          "Amazing Museum, verry intresting show\u2019s you how life was in the artic. Sometimes surprising and somerimes confronting. Absolute must when you have a half a day.",
          "Very interesting museum showcasing how it was the life in the Arctic in the early times. It is perfect enough to spend an hour during your stay in Tromso. Entrance is not that expensive as well - costs around 7 Euros. Although I am an animal lover it is a bit depressing to learn",
          "... exposition of whale and seal hunting is not appropriate in times of mass species extinction ....",
          "My wife and I had a great time exploring the Polar Museum in Tromso. The museum is a combination of local history and polar history and has an interesting collection of realia and photographs. The museum is on several floors and is well organized. The accompanying explanations",
          "We visited this museum whilst on a stopover with the Hurtigruten cruise. It\u2019s about a 15-20 minute walk from the boat. It gives an interesting account of life in the Arctic, which was tough. So yes, there are some gory bits, but that\u2019s how it was! We were given a leaflet in",
          "Well worth an hour or twos visit while in Tromso. Some brilliant local history as well as polar history generally. I am always in awe of what these pioneers did with the resources they had at the time and this museum provides some real insight into their strength, resilience and",
          "OK to visit if nothing else to do. 1 to 3 hrs max enough. A historical and educational experience. 70 kroner per pax.",
          "This is a little museum, but very informative. Before you enter they give you a pamphlet in English that explains the different displays. To be honest, a lot of the pictures on display are pretty gory, especially for animal lovers. The museum showcases just how brutal life in",
          "A high-quality museum close to the city centre. Ticket price - NOK 70. All the explanations in the museum are in Norwegian, but you get a guide brochure in maybe more understandable language, even Russian. I would not recommend this museum for small children: seal hunting scenes",
          "We visited here today as a party of four. It\u2019s a smallish museum but has plenty of information about pre-historic life and also Arctic exploration - lots on Roald Amuldsen and the race to the poles, in particularly. Overall the museum is a little dated but it flows well enough.",
          "Good description of the polar expeditions. A little bit of everything: life, persons, history. Strongly recommended.",
          "This place really is good value for money. It doesn't look big from the outside, but it certainly seems to be more than adequate for all the many and varied exhibits on the inside. Well worth going to find out about the exploration of the Arctic and the way of life of the",
          "Troms\u00f8 has a great history as a hub for Arctic and Polar (yes, South as well) exploration. This museum details out both research but also exploitation of the area and puts it in their historic context. It is an important museum. Troms\u00f8 is rich in culture and museums, if you have",
          "Lovely museum. They give you a fold up chair to carry with you if you have a cane and need to sit down! Tells a lot about the polar expeditions and people who settled in Tromso. Worth a visit.",
          "High international standard and very well told description of the old hunting, trekking and fishing in the Arctic and the Barents Sea, the explorers in the Arctic, the wildlife and the many challenges. Also, visit the book shop for interesting arctic literature. I've been here",
          "I visited with my father and son 18.07.2019. The exhibits were fairly standard but the story of Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen artic expedition was very interesting.",
          "It is deceptive from the outside and we were amazed by the display inside and how big it was. Very well laid out, with loads of information about the brave men who explored the polar reactions. Not expensive and well worth a few hours. A short walk from the cruise terminal.",
          "The Polar Museum should be on the itinerary of anyone visiting Norway. More than a museum, it is full of information on polar exploration, early life in the arctic, animal life -- seals, whales, and a skeleton of a walrus which is an amazing sight. Also penguins, puffins and",
          "We tried to visit Polar Museu, but we\u00b4ve couldn\u00b4t. It was on January 2019. Closed. Maybe on maintenance. Heavy snow. Dust and dark. If I were in Tromso, I would try a visit. Schedule it.",
          "Educational & good for kids. All the 4 museums are together so commute wise it is easier. It also has a polar stimulator where you can experience how it feels like in Arctic or Antartic.",
          "Housed in a building near the harbor, this is an unique museum featuring many things about Arctic life. If particular interest were the adventures of Roald Amundsen and Fridjof Nansen. There were also exhibitions on hunting and trapping in the Arctic, especially Svalbard,",
          "All the family liked this museum, great place To visit with kids of any ages. I learned a lot and the children too.",
          "Not very elaborate, but a harsh reminder of the determination of the hunters and the odds they faced. Their imagination in killing knew no bounds and many ingenious ways were devices to handicap and kill different prey. You feel sorry for the lives they wantonly killed for",
          "Great overview of the polar region of Norway and all the hardships; the fishing, whaling and seal hunting industries; the explorers and vessels and realistic displays.",
          "An interesting museum that can provide you a bit of a crash course on famous Norwegian expoorers. They have translated booklets that serve as companions to the things you see in each room (there are some placards in English) but for the most part you need to match up what room",
          "After going to other lacklustre museums in Tromso, this one really stood out. The downstairs exhibitions were lacking somewhat, in both their organisation and the lack of English translations. However, the upstairs exhibition on Nansen's Polar Exhibition made up for this. The",
          "Great museum showing the Polar history. Plan to spend some time here. Showing the impressive history of the Norwegian explorers.",
          "If you're a details freak, you can spend here a whole day I'd say. There are guides on entry in different languages containing a lot of info and separated in sections marked with room numbers. May be difficult to go through if you've got a weak heart and opposed to animal",
          "If you are interested in the Polar histoty , this is a must . Very many fine stories and deatails from the many expeditions",
          "What a superb little museum in this great town. Fascinating info mainly about Nansen and Amundsen, 2 amazing men; one who led the way, with his 'invention' of skiing, (certainly popularising of it), and the other who conquered the NWpassage, South Pole and flights over North",
          "Very interesting displays of the life and travels of Roald Amundsen and Fridjof Nansen, the polar explorers who came from Tromso. Most descriptions naturally in Norwegian and some in English but did not detract from the interest. My knowledge of simple Danish did help.",
          "The Tromso Polar Museum is located in a building nearly 200 years old. Tromso is in the Arctic and a good base for expeditions to the North Pole. Local resident Roald Amundsen and his team were the first to reach the North Pole in 1926 and this expedition is the main subject of",
          "Upstairs in the museum is where the history buff's will get their fill. It's all about Arctic exploration, including the famous Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen, and his sailing of the North West Passage and leading the first expedition to the South Pole. Downstairs is more",
          "Inside this museum there is a lot of information about polar expeditions and how people lived here over the ages, in harsh conditions. Fishing and hunting were there means of survival. There also nice boat models and diorama's about daily life in this unforgiving climate. A",
          "Pretty well done. Learned about the polar explorers and whaling industry. Can get through it in an hour, or spend more time if the weather is bad.",
          "Quite an Interesting history, lots of reading. Most information in Norwegian. Not a very modern museum.",
          "From the outside this museum doesn\u2019t look much but don\u2019t be misled, it is brilliant. So informative. You will not be disappointed.",
          "Amazing museum with great history of the polar expeditions and polar activities from thousands of years ago too the most recent history. Student discount and the combo ticket with Troms\u00f8 University museum made this the best value for money museum visit I have done in Norway so",
          "Really interesting museum regarding Norway's history particularly regarding hunting. There are quite a few skins etc around but as this was part of their history I don't think it should be avoided for this! You get an English guide when you go in which is helpful. Great way to",
          "A good museum if you are interested in the history of Norway's Arctic exploits. Although the info around the museum is in Norwegian when you get your entrance ticket the booklet they hand out gives you most of the info in English. All in all a very interesting little museum.",
          "As others have said, this is an Interesting if a little quirky museum, there are some English language translations and we were provided with a well thumbed English language guide was handed out on entering. Clearly this museum is run on a shoe-string, but is non the worse for",
          "An interesting museum about the way of life here in the past. I learnt a lot about Amundsen and Nansen. Lots of stuffed animals and skins, but that is how it was! Worth a visit.",
          "Nice warm museum, not at all old style with good displays. Not good if you\u2019re at all squeamish or have strong anti-hunting views! Very informative about the history of the region and polar exploration. Displays mainly labelled in Norwegian but language translation guide",
          "Good displays. Shows how they lived by hunting and fishing. Shows exploration of Amundsen and Nansen with artifacts. Well worth it.",
          "An informative museum. Lots of stuffed artic animals and their skins here. Lots of information on the Arctic explorers too. My 8 year old loved it here. You would probably spend about and hour and a half here.",
          "Interesting if a little quirky museum, very little English language signage makes it hard to fully enjoy the experience. A grubby well thumbed English language guide was handed out on entering but was not of much use. That said the exhibits that did have English translation were",
          "Deceivingly small and dull from the outside, this Museum is a gem of displays and information about the historical Polar expeditions to the North Pole, legendary exploration heroes and how Tromso developed from a base forseal hunters. The English translation guidebooks were a",
          "Interesting hour looking at life in the Artic over the years. The first impression is that it was quite brutal with hunting quite central in the first few rooms",
          "Quaint and educational. Good historical background. Not high tech and I think for older children only. Helped us understand the context of Troms\u00f8",
          "Its a nice stop to see some history, the museu is relatively small, so it wont take much of the day, and add some knowledge to the trip.",
          "We could have skipped this museum and wouldn\u2019t have missed anything important. A rundown little place with a surly staff, it is full of dead stuffed animals and dioramas that depict (some in quite gruesome detail) the slaughter of seals, polar bears and other arctic wildlife. We",
          "Worth your time. Subtitled in English. Lots of fascinating artifacts and history. We really likes our trip here.",
          "Just ok if you have nothing to do in Tromso but still worth a visit. Its in the city center and nearby other attractions hence you can add this in your things or places to visit in Tromso",
          "an interesting visit to this museum which tells the story of expeditions and how the Norwegian and Arctic land and wildlife were explored and exploited over time.",
          "2nd time in Troms\u00f8 and in Polarmuseet. Nice piace to have a look at Svalbard\u2019s life during first expeditions and learn something about them. Highly recommended",
          "At first sight this museum appears a slightly ramshackle collection of stuff. But as you go through it, it is impossible not to become immersed in the fascinating stories it tells of Arctic (and Antarctic) exploration and the men an women involved.",
          "Superb museum to visit. While I was given a paper guide that was in English, most of the text around the museum was in Norwegian, which made some things pretty difficult to follow. That being said, the museum had plenty of pictures, artefacts and displays that kept me fully",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the hour or so we were in the museum and would advise anyone interested in the native Norwegian way of life years ago to as well as the history of Tromso to visit.. Yes it is all a bit cramped and yes it's a little amateur but on a cold winter's day it is",
          "Had a wander round, some interesting stuff, but nothing that wowed us. Very basic museum, with only some of the descriptions in English. Expensive for what it was",
          "A very interesting museum. I learned a lot about polar exploration and the main historical figures. Many pieces have an English translation and there is an English language guide book to explain exhibits. Liked this a lot! High quality exhibits",
          "It provides interesting information about the hunting culture int he area and expeditions to the North Pole. However, the place looks rather small and information in English is only provided in a leaflet, which is not easy to follow. It's a good place to spend your day if",
          "We had a few hours spare so went to this Museum. Very good, if you are into Artic History, reasonable price. Worth the visit Very near main town high street.",
          "Most of it is indeed about animal trapping and hunting, so some may find that upsetting (I am a serious animal lover myself), but on the other hand it is a strong part of Norwegian history and the driving force behind a lot of arctic exploration so you can't reasonably expect a",
          "So brutal! It's not a happy fun place for kids or anything, what with all the baby seal clubbing and polar bear suicide inventions, but it details the harsh reality of humans surviving in the arctic in the early days. Fascinating and gruesome, but expectedly so. There were too",
          "I usually like historic museums like this one, and I found it quite interesting, and it really gives the idea of how it was to travel in the arctic with the technology they had back then. I does not take too long to visit, and the price it totally worth it. We visited it when it",
          "About Svalbard only, lots of deceased animals. They gave a english BOOK to understand all of exposition, but there was no legend in english. It became too tired and boring.",
          "The museum is very informative on the local life during the early hunting and expedition days. A lot of original items of that time. A walk through brochure is available at the entrance in many languages. If you have time it is worth a visit.",
          "Incredible resources on polar explorers and life on Svalbard through the centuries. For me the museum is a must see. Located close to the harbour",
          "Small museum featuring historical photos, exhibited artefacts including trapping gear and the occasional stuffed seal that didn't look too happy! Worth a visit to appreciate the grim way many people used to make a living for themselves and their families.",
          "Nice museum where you can learn lots of things about artic exploration and the artic world. The building itself is also very interesting. Worth a visit to learn about this harsh environment and the people dealing with it",
          "There is some great history here of Polar exploration and hunting. This is not for the faint hearted as hunting for food and warmth is a fact of life here. the museum shows the success and failures of the early explorers",
          "This was a fine collection of polar exploration memorabilia housed in a lovely old wooden building. Worth seeing.",
          "We were only in Tromso for a couple of days and so shortlisted some possible places to visit, this museum being one of them. We arrived at the museum about 45 minutes before closing, however it was a small museum so we thought this would be enough time. We were out within 5",
          "This museum is small but has lots of in-depth information into hunting of seals, whales and polar bears. None of the displays are in English but you are given a leaflet with English explanations, it makes it quite hard to work everything out and I think it would definitely",
          "Cost nk70 and spent 1.5 hrs - it was interesting especially to see life when hunting was a way of life and hear about the arctic explorations.",
          "This museum isn\u2019t what I expected at all. It\u2019s primarily about expeditions to Svalbard and (over)hunting of various animals for financial gain - polar bears, foxes, seals, etc. They talk about the people who hunted, showed how they killed the animals, and provided stories around",
          "This museum takes in the history of whaling and sealing, if you don\u2019t want to see or read about that you will need to skip the first part. Overall it was ok, you had to read about everything in the booklet that you were given, which had to be returned at the end.",
          "Great for learning history of the region, it's small and compact but really informative. You are given a leaflet in your language to explain the exhibits, worth a visit!",
          "well worth a visit and you can really appreciate the work involved in this site. staff very knowledgible in the displays & excellent in answering questions.",
          "Very interesting place, although nearly all the exhibits were accompanied by Norweigan text. They gave us a little brochure on the way in with English explanations, but some of the items were numbered incorrectly which made it a bit difficult to find what some of the things",
          "Unless you like hunting but there\u2019s nothing impressive. No the facility, no the information. Still it give you an idea of the way they used to live in this area. Since everything is about hunting it\u2019s depressing if you\u2019re animal lover.",
          "Coming from England, a relatively temperature and forgiving country to live in, the way of life that the Polar Museum shows is almost beyond comprehension. The work these people had to do just to survive can be incredible. Their daily way of life is harder than most people can",
          "Really wasn't a fan of this museum. Really glorified the hunting and trapping history and there were better ways it could have been told. Very graphic displays involving stuffed dead animals. Made me feel physically ill.",
          "Closed for the week we were there, which is such a shame as we were really looking forward to seeing the exhibit. Tromso was full of tourists, so seemed an odd time to be closed",
          "Nice museum with many rooms on Arctic life and polar exploration. Free guide book in English so you\u2019re not totally confused by the Norwegian descriptions. Some stuff is a bit contrived and cheesy but the display on Amundsen is excellent.",
          "Nice place to visit in Troms\u00f8! Good and relaxing time spent here with friends and family. Profesional and nice staff!",
          "not to expensive. realy good for the money. lot to see and to read. nice to see everything. way better then polaria",
          "Had just re-opened.. Very well laid out and interesting exhibits throughout..Tough these Norwegians..! Would have like more English translations on the smaller exhibits..",
          "We were there with a tourguide so don\u2019t know the prices. I really liked the visual experience, not only text but a lot of stuff you can feel and are allowed to touch. One of the betrer museum-experiences!",
          "A good museum that looks at the polar history of Norway. My only issue was the booklet they provide is written in too small a writing for me to easily read It is not closed despite people saying it is, you need to visit the right museum towards the bridge",
          "Unbelievably shut in Sami week, although being advertised as having a Sami Display. Could be worth a visit but not knowing what is inside and when open.",
          "This site is still closed despite the website stating that they would be opening back up on January 6th. We tried to go on January 12th but it looks like they are closed until February",
          "There are many items used by the explorers of old times. It is nice and neat and definitely something to do while someone is in Troms\u00f8. I recommend it.",
          "Although we checked the website before walking there and it had open hours listed, when we arrived, it was under major renovation. See picture that was attached to back fence. It says reopen on January 6, 2019, but I would call first.",
          "A nice diversion if you have a free afternoon. And don\u2019t miss the sea otters training...they will melt your heart!",
          "I heard so much about this wonderful museum which is located facing the harbour. It is a red in colour. However, I was disappointed to find it closed for renovation.",
          "A lot to see. Great place to spend few hours with family. Is not many places in the world where can see a polar bears. Definitely worth it when in Tromso!",
          "We went because my mom and I are fascinated with all things about Antarctica and the Arctic. It\u2019s a small museum with a lot of information and exhibits. We really enjoyed visiting it.",
          "Very disappointed. Considering this is one of the main museums in Tromso there was no information on their website to say it\u2019s closed until 6 January. We had to find out from a notice placed on their door. This was one of the reasons we had come to Tromso.",
          "Nowhere on their website says that it is closed so walked there to find construction work on-going and signs to say shut until 6th January. Advance warning on their webpage would have been nice.",
          "This museum covered a lot of polar history ranging from famous explorers, tales of hardship and survival (or not), and as horrible as it sounds the barbarity of the old ways of living in the harsh polar region. It does not have some of the modern technology like audio",
          "A shame that it was closed for refurnishment. My review is low due to not finding out till we got there that it was closed. I hadn't seen anything online to say it was.",
          "This is a very town-specific museum that houses the early history of the Tromso area. It was built upon the fur, fishing, and whaling industries. Many of the original implements, tools, bones, pelts, stuffed animals, and pictures graphically depict how the animals were",
          "Told myself not to visit anymore museum but there is really nothing much else to do. It was raining, so went in and paid 60kr. Nothing much to describe except stuffs you will see in every museum except this one displays the local history.",
          "great museum with info about polar expeditions and various explorers! visitors were given a paper booklet in english which explains every room/exhibit. may be better if the booklet is laminated? it seems to be falling apart! haha but still very useful.",
          "The Polar Museum has an immense range and depth of material describing many aspects of Polar discovery, life and work. Presented very well. From the outside it looks like a small building but once inside it keeps expanding. We spent several hours, but it could have been more.",
          "Larger than I thought it would be, lots to read and interesting information on the polar explorations from Troms\u00f8. Filled in an hour on a rainy day.",
          "It looks small from the outside, however there is many information inside. The visit was included in the walking tour I did. I believe that is the best way to go in, understand and appreciate what is inside",
          "Nice small museum gets pretty in depth explaining things we did a fly by visit not getting deep into all the exhibits. Inexpensive. Well worth it.",
          "The Polar Museum is small but vert nicely put together. Anyone interested in the history of how harsh life was. Lots of displays of stuffed animals and old tools and artefacts, clothing, Entrance fee 50Nok, worth it in my opinion",
          "This museum is a small interesting place about the polar expeditions and the animals that were hunted in them. The information is very helpful to learn about this topic, but it was hard to realize that so many animals were slaughtered like that for survival of the human kind. It",
          "We chanced upon this museum and decided to go in. it is a very interesting and well laid out museum. A word of warning, it has some quite graphic displays dealing with the hunting of seals, bears etc. in the early days so if you are feint of heart it may not be the place for",

          "We spent about an hour here. It's a good museum with interesting info. We both felt it really enhanced our visit to the Fram Museum in Oslo later. The displays felt a bit tired. Not everything is in English, but it's enough. Really enjoyed the Roald Amundsen exhibits - what",
          "Unfortunately most of the displays have descriptions written only in norwegian but some also have English descriptions. Nonetheless it\u2019s interesting to look around. If you do the city walking tour it is included in that and you will have the tour guide to explain everything",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Most of the exhibits are labelled in Norwegian (why wouldn\u2019t they be...), but when you arrive they give you a little booklet in your own language to explain what you\u2019re looking at. There are some really interesting facts,",
          "There wasn\u2019t much about this museum that wowed us. It\u2019s in need of exhibit updating: HOWEVER, everything is extremely interesting and they have guides in many languages if you cannot read the Norweigan descriptions. I definitely learned something! I give it a \u201cvery good\u201d score",
          "Lovely museum in Tromso where you will be able to learn a bit more about Amundsen's trip to the North Pole and Arctic life in general. Very interesting if you have a spare couple of hours while your stay in Tromso.",
          "My wife and I visited the Polar Museum in July. The museum is interesting, but most of the displays had writing that were in Norwegian. They do provide a free returnable English guide that does help. Parking is very difficult and expensive in downtown Tromso. We ended up",

          "I think this museum could be more interactive. You had to read a lot and there were a lot of animal skins and stuffed hunted animals. It made me a little uncomfortable to see all of it, frankly. I understand that was the polar trade at one time but I am quite happy the seals,",

          "It was really impressive to see everything related to the polar region's life in one exhibition. I know the trapping and sealing sections might be disturbing to some, but this was the way of life then and I found it very informative. There are some English signs and the guide",
          "The museum contains a lot of information about the history of exploring the artic, and many artifacts about Roald Amundsen's voyage through the Northwest Passage, finding magnetic north, and his journey aboard the Fram to the South Pole. Interesting little museum in a rather",

          "If you\u2019re even sort of Interested in polar exploration, this is the museum for you. Be sure to budget a couple of hours at least, because you\u2019ll want to see everything.",
          "We went to the Polar Museum in Tromso after exploring Tromso on a bus tour from the ship Silver Sea. This is a very small museum in an old container, extended. There were examples of the way of life of former trappers, examples of former types of traps used very cruelly to",
          "We had a tour around this small but history packed museum, every space used to full potential, exhibits are impressive and the knowledge that can be gained is huge if you already know what you are looking at, without the tour I would not have gained much from the displays,",
          "Probably an hour\u2019s worth of entertainment unless you a really into polar exploration. As a Brit, I liked the Norwegian bias regarding the race to the South Pole - entirely appropriate. We did it on a joint museum ticket deal. It filled in a spare couple of hours on a rainy",
          "It was free entrance when we got there! The museum is full of information about history of expeditions. Must see!",
          "Rather small museum but ideal to learn more about nordic expeditions and personal stories. Worth while to visit.",

          "There\u2019s a lot packed into this modestly-sized former waterfront warehouse. We especially enjoyed the intriguing polar exploration exhibits we found on the upper floor \u2013 including attempts to reach the North Pole by air, the colorful life and polar (North Pole and South!)",

          "I would definitely stop at the Polar Museum. You can probably cover the entire museum in about 1 hour. Learned a great deal about the Norwegians part in polar exploration and about the industry in the polar regions. It would be a good place to take children.",
          "Polar museum has lots of intresting stories to tell about Nansen, Johanssen and Amudsen. All interesting exhipition items are on the top floor. The museum is not big so it was crowdy.",
          "I liked this little museum, which crams a lot of Arctic history into a relatively small space. I learned a lot about the history of Arctic exploration in general, but the most fascinating exhibits were the ones detailing the treks of Roald Amundsen (which I were familiar with)",
          "I'm a museum junkie and went here on my first day in Tromso. It packs a lot of detail of the history in northern Norway and polar exploration. I went through it twice because it was so interesting and I wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything. An excellent place to visit to",
          "Very well done with history carefully documented but it\u2019s depressing. All that killing of those poor defenceless animals. It appears the greedy Norwegians of old had no heart. If you\u2019re a vegetarian, animal lover or someone of high sensibilities I wouldn\u2019t go. It made me feel",
          "On recommendation from a friend we went upstairs in the polar museum to make the best use of our time. The polar explorers exhibit was well worth our visit!! So glad we went.",

          "Tromso has served as the embarkation point for countless Arctic expeditions, including Roald Amundsen\u2019s final, fatal flight to attempt a rescue of a missing fellow explorer. This museum documents not only these expeditions, but also life in the far north, including trapping,",

          "A medium size museum that offers a lot of amazing pictures and stories about incredible explorers. Good for a quick visit, prolly 45 minutes or so.",
          "We didn\u2019t really know what to expect from this place, I\u2019m not a big fan of aquarium but this place was well set out and there seemed like plenty of room for the seals. They are the real stars of the show and worth popping in. It is quite expensive to get in, I imagine it would",
          "This is a museum about Arctic life, the settlers to the Arctic and how they survived. Along with some specific tales of Norwegian explorers. Very interesting museum with a lot to be learned. Something to consider is that Arctic life wasn't always kind. A detailed model of a",

          "Fascinating displays, but they could have done without the wax figures...it didn\u2019t really add to the experience and they were not very well made. Great photographs and artifacts and a neat environment. We had a guide (from the Historic City Walking Tour), so that made it all the",
          "Although relatively small the museum has some interesting items and is presented very well. we had an engaging couple of hours here and would recommend it.",
          "Lots of good exhibits but most of the information is in Norwegian so unless you have an English speaking guide it it difficult to fully appreciate the captions.",
          "I love polar history so I looked forward to seeing this museum. Whilst the sections on Admusen and the other explorers were really well done and interesting, I found the glorifying of trapping and killing animals like polar bears, confronting. I saw people avoiding certain",
          "Wasn't sure about visiting this museum but turned out to be interesting and worth the entrance fee. Provides a good insight into polar exploration and the hunting that took place from Tromso.",
          "This small museum gives an impression of the first polar expeditions and the difficult circumstances for the people who had to survive in the cold. There are a few really good dioramas showing how the trappers lived. The early winter trapping expeditions to Svalbard",
          "Very interesting exhibitions,reasonable admission price, really gives a feel for the Arctic explorers",
          "We visited the Polar Museum whilst on a cruise to Norway. Extremely well laid out and lots of interesting artefacts. Explanations in English and Norwegian. Thought the gift shop was rather expensive, but well worth the visit.",

          "The display of the exhibits may be a bit old fashioned, but the story of the scientists is still quite interesting. Also the descriptions about the hunting of seals for their furs and whales gives a good insight in the Norwegian way of thinking (e.g. when describing the human",

          "So, we didn't have loads of time and needed to pick something that we could check out in an afternoon before our tour. I'm glad we came here. You can see different info, exhibits, and stuffed seals. It was interesting to view all the information. They will give you a paper in",

          "I found this to be a real education, having previously known little about whaling etc, and only a small amount about the arctic expeditions. There was plenty to look at, and although most was in Norwegian, detailed booklets (lots of reading) were supplied for free meaning",
          "Nice museum in the middle of Troms\u00f8 that shows the history of the early settlers in the region, the heritage of Sealing and Polar Bear trapping as well as some of the local legends from the area.",
          "We visited the Polar museum on a week day and we spent around 2 hours there to learn all about the history of legendary hunters / fisherman / explorers back in the day. The items displayed are very interesting and some quite ancient which makes the visit truly worth your time. I",

          "This is a quaint museum that is definitely worth a visit if you can spare about 30 mins to an hour. It has a wide variety of historical artifacts going back to the days of the seal fur trade and continuing through the exploration of Nansen and Amundsen. Not expensive, concise,",

          "Located on the Harbour, it's worth a visit to learn a bit about the history and life of an arctic fishermen place: fauna, artefacts, North (and South) pole Explorators, living standards. Borrow a brochure in your language from the cashier.",
          "I think is an ok experience nothing special I think they should give audio tour instead of a little brochure",
          "Good place to spend an hour and learn about the Arctic life. Good exhibitions and great to read the histories. Quite OK price as entrance!",

          "I was having higher expectations of this museum. I believe more can be added to attract more visitors.",
          "An interesting visit, more so than I anticipated. Some of the exhibits are explained in English, most not, but you are supplied with a guide book giving information on what is in each room. And as you move upstairs there are 10 or more small rooms filled with items. You do need",
          "I found this museum a bit depressing and not quite as advertised. I found the whole museum was primary about whaling, sealing and hunting in the arctic. I understand this was the way of life here, but I found the museum a bit dusty and just filled with stuffed animals, which",
          "The museum is quite extensive over two floors. The early part of the planned route through the museum concentrates on life in the Arctic and the Seal, Whale and Polar bear hunting. For me this was a bit depressing although you have to accept that this was the accepted way of",

          "A museum that doesn\u2019t shy away from its history, no matter how Non-pc some of the subject matter may be. Yes some areas concerned with trapping, whaling or seal pups will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, however the museum is so much more. Fantastic exhibition on the Polar explorers",
          "The small Polar museum is very interesting and holds many good exhibits to learn more about the polar life, expeditions and history. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to see everything. I can recommend it to everyone visiting Troms\u00f6.",

          "We really didn't like the place from the moment we walked in, but the life-size model of a white guy clubbing a baby seal was when we just decided to leave. This is no museum -- there is very little that offers to teach. The story of exploiting the environment and killing off as",
          "We had 4 hours stopover in Tromso with Hurtigruten. We followed the signs for the Polar Museum, but the route was rather more convoluted than necessary, and could be done in 15 minutes if you knew where you were going. It's an interesting little museum, spread over 2 floors,",
          "Lovely little museum, even if small it gives you a glimpse of the polar lifestyle, Tromso's history and gives you an overview of what does it mean to be born above the Arctic! Worth to spend there 1 hour or so.",
          "I didn't really planned the visit, but I had a day in between some active tours and decided for sightseeing Troms\u00f8, which included a visit to the Polar Museum. It's definitely not the largest museum on earth, but the setup with separated rooms gives structure in the tour",
          "The museum was clean, had a lot of historical information and translation books in a variety of languages for each to understand artifacts. The building itself was historical as well and had lovely wood floors well cared for. It was easy to get here right on the waterfront, had",
          "Very small museum but rich in historical findings. Very interesting to see how poorly dressed were the first explorers that dared to reach the North Pole. I liked the exhibitions. Please be aware that the museum is very small so it will take you maximum 1 hour to see it.",
          "I visited the museum with my family and it has a great display of Artic Exploration. It shows animals, lifestyle, explorers and their expeditions, and much more. Worth a visit",
          "This is a nice museum you get to know more about Norwegian history ,it has two floors and broken into various rooms,it focuses on arctic exploration and they give you flyers in English and few other languages as well..fun to walk around. One should visit this museum if in Troms\u00f8.",
          "Visited as part of my week long visit to Tromso. Fascinating and very educational. I learnt a lot. Exhibits varied and informative. Great way to get to know more about arctic Norway, its history and achievements. Worth visiting.",
          "Will laid out displays with plenty of information in English. Explained the history of the region, hunting, exploring etc clearly. Amazing to see exhibits and read about the polar explorations",
          "A museum dedicated to the greeat men and women who explored the far north. Most interesting display of artifacts. A Must See!",
          "The small exterior dimensions of the beautiful building that houses the Polarmuseet overlooking the Troms\u00f8's harbor could mislead the richness of the interior exposure; nothing more wrong because the Polarmuseet offers a very interesting and complete collection that guides the",
          "Don\u2019t be deceived thinking this is a little museum, it kept us entertained for a good couple of hours and we learned lots!! Super little place",
          "The museum actually contains quite a lot of information about what life was like for those living in in tromso whilst hunting for polar bears and seals. It's quite detailed-if you are looking for anything on Sami culture or anything this probably isn't the right place for you,",
          "A very interesting museum which tells the story of polar life and exploration. The building itself is also of historic interest. A good choice for an hour or so.",
          "On entry I was given a well thumbed pamphlet in English on some of the exhibits. I found this a bit difficult to follow and kept having to refer back to the right page to find the text. Most exhibits are in Norwegian which I found strange for such a touristy city. Most if not",
          "Not expensive to get in at all and packed with lots of interesting sights and information-make sure you get the guide from the desk as some of the items on show only have Norwegian info next to them. Seat at regular intervals to sit and go through the guide which is very",
          "Really enjoyed this museum, although you had to read the guide book in English as you were going round it really gave you a flavour of what the polar explorers endured on their journeys and how they survived in the extreme conditions. Well worth a visit",
          "We visited the Polar Museum on our second day in Troms\u00f8 to fill in a couple of spare hours we had. At only 60NOK per person we weren't expecting a great deal, it exceeded expectations! We were handed a booklet which explained the displays in English which came in very helpful.",
          "This is a must see in Tromso. The displays are fascinating with history of the region, of Admundsen, of Samii culture and more. It is easy to reach but be careful if there in the winter because of ice on the streets. Once inside, it is very comfortable. There are some English",
          "I recommend visiting the museum at the beginning of your trip to Troms\u00f8, it is fascinating and awe inspiring to learn what the polar explorers had to endure. And if you happen to go on a husky trip afterwards it puts what they endured into sharp perspective",
          "Troms\u00f8 museum is well worth the visit. English booklet explaining exhibits given as you go in. Nice and close to city centre.",
          "Small but very informative, make sure you get the English guide from the front counter (as you would expect) it\u2019s all in Norwegian",
          "It's a basic museum that is certainly not high tech or interactive so it's probably more interesting for adults than children. It's old fashioned in a charming way, and they have created a lot of anachronistic spaces that make you feel like you're in the past. The stories they",
          "Not a very large museum but interesting history of the Tromso area- learned a lot but not a must see.",
          "It was a great stop there, not a really great museum but very informative. We could connect that with my other comment \u201epolar bear society\u201c. It is very historic and beautiful animal shown with love.",
          "I found this museum a bit challenging (seal skins etc) but it is a part of the Norwegian history and it is very informative. Seals are not killed for their skins anymore. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I visited the Polar Museum whilst in Troms\u00f8 on holiday. I was very thankful as the staff provided me with and English booklet as I can\u2019t read Norwegian. The booklet was very useful however a lot of the displays are still written in Norwegian. A notably difficult room to grasp",
          "We had a booklet in English to follow to the museum through it's 11 rooms. This was sufficient for me to understand what was being exhibited and being abroad, I would not have expected for it to labeled in English. The museum gives a story of survival in the arctic and how it",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Polar Museum. It is divided up into \"Rooms\" and we were given a book in English to read, which followed the rooms as we went. This worked well for me as I love reading. My husband, not so much. He's a slow reader and takes a while to comprehend.",
          "As a new local I wanted to learn more about Northern Norway, Tromsoe, etc. The Polar Museum is a nice, educative museum about the city's history, arctic exploring, sealing, etc. It's small but that didn't matter to me. Take your time to check out everything while you walk around",
          "The museum is small and perhaps a little old-fashioned as it has stuffed animals and panoramas to show the life of the 19th C Artic with its whaling and sealing history. Nonetheless is it interesting to see the adventures of Amundsen and other Arctic explorers. The descriptions",
          "This museum contains a lot of information, artefacts, and dioramas with a focus on Svalbard, the Arctic, and some of the landmark explorations by Amundsen and Nansen. You also learn about hunting the large animals of the Arctic. Most of the exhibition is in Norwegian without",
          "A lot of valuable informatuin. Yiuvare provided with a small booklet in English or another language of your choice. If you take the time to read the booklet with the exhibits there is a lot of valuable information. If you are interested in Nansen and Amensen two if the famous",
          "The display was awesome and mammals and mannequin were so real. The museum backtrack to early days on life in the Artic and at the end of the tour one will get a good understanding. Don't forget to take lots of picture with the display as background. The Polar Museum is not",
          "The museum provided an interesting insight to history of the region. Most of the displays are in Norwegian but the guide books provided are well laid out and provide all the information.",
          "The North Pole Museum is a small museum which exhibits the way of life in the arctic region. It is divided in small rooms, which all cover other themes. You receive a booklet in English at the information desk, because all the written information in the museum in in Norsk (which",
          "I enjoyed my visit here far more than I thought I would. The entire place is laid out extremely well and gives an insight into the History of Norway\u2019s people, their way of life, and the accomplishments of some of their most famous explorers-all information I realised I knew",
          "Very interesting stories from early polar expeditions. Most of the displays are written in Norwegian but we were given a booklet explaining most section in English. Worth a visit!",
          "Good Norse history very interesting artefacts well worth visiting,everything well laid out with easy access,cafe and toilets on site",
          "Spend an hour or so, great value for money.I really liked the set ups about the hunters, with the sound effects.",
          "A very small museum which takes about different polar expeditions and about Ronald amuldson , Svalbard history ... Was not having any expectations before i went but it was better than i felt.",
          "It\u2019s a small museum (all Troms\u00f8 site seeings places are small!) but nice and good to know about the arctic life. Souvenirs have good selections as well. We bought polar bear T-shirts for whole family here.",
          "The other downtown Tromso museum is, like Polaria, modest and won\u2019t require more than a couple of hours to see unless you can read Norwegian. Unlike Polaris, it\u2019s housed over 2.5 floors in an old warehouse (so oozes charm and history) with exposed wood walls and original",
          "This small museum can easily be visited in 1.5 to 2 hours also with children. It gives a good idea of the life of arctic pioneers and of arctic hunters. It provides comprehensive information about the trip of Nansen abord the Fram. It completes nicely the visit of the Fram",
          "Very interesting museum telling the story of the first settlers and explorers of the area. Reasonably priced entrance fee and a guide in English. Some of the signage is in English too.",
          "Looks like a small hut at the back alley, not very interesting, I suppose quite educational but overall boring",
          "It is a very interesting museum about polar life and discoveries and expeditions into Arctic. Worth visiting it if you spend some time in Tromso or in the region. Easy to understand and suitable for children. The visit is about 1 hour (minimum)",
          "Worth a visit but don\u2019t go out of your way. Lots of history, but you can\u2019t really appreciate it all as not translated. The staff provide a booklet in english which is helpful.",
          "The museum gives an excellent overview of the history of polar expeditions. It has a wonderful collection of artifacts (including stuffed animals) and the displays are well done. The museum does not have English (and German) translations at all places but together with the",
          "If you're visiting Tromso this museum is well worth a visit. I spent a couple of hours looking at the displays and loved all the information about polar life. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum focuses on early Arctic life in the region, including detailed coverage of the more notable over-Arctic expeditions, including Amundsen and Nansen. It is well curated, and has plenty of visual exhibits to keep the narratives interesting, for kids also.",
          "Surprisingly interesting museum. Some exhibits make you feel personally involved. Definitely recommended!",
          "This university museum reflects exploration of manly men going off to the frozen tundra to see what they could see, and hunt. Who knew there were so many seal varieties? For those who view animal pelts and trophies with horror, or even dismay, this will be hellish, but the",
          "This is a small museum with a lot packed into it. The area grew on hunting so dont get offened by some of the exhibits. That was life then",
          "We had a good time going through the Museum. It is very well planned and informative. One can spend a couple of hours at this place and gain lot of knowledge of this region.",
          "A good little museum. Well thought out and it gives you an insight into the hardships of the early settlers and explorers of the region. There is a little booklet that is given to you in your language. And some of the exhibits are written in English and German as well as",
          "Easy to get to, full of interesting information, very reasonable. Quite enjoyable afternoon, learned all about seal hunting history.",
          "it was 10~15 min walk from the hotel we stayed. a small by very interesting museum of polar expedition. oh, yes, I remember the story of Amundsen and Scott in my primary school class. of course there were much and many more. later on this trip we also visited the polar ship",
          "The Polar Museum is a cozy museum that I could learn about the artic, though it's mostly old-fashioned and the language is all Norwegian. The staff does give out a manual, but I could see that it wasn't well kept; the manual was mostly ripped and damaged. Overall, the museum is",
          "Right on the waterfront this museum gives to a taste of old Tromso. Polar bears, exploration and mans determination to survive in the wilderness. Worth a visit, it took us an hour but we were interested. A guide book in English helps!",
          "The museum it self is very old-fashioned and hardly features any translation. You get an worn-out paper print with all the translations. The objects itself are presentated in a very old-fashioned way. The museum focuses on hunting and the exploration of the North Pole. However,",
          "This museum is located in the Troms\u00f8 town centre. There are plenty of information about the history of fishing and hunting in the Artic region. The visitor's experience could be improved by adding more descriptions in English, an audioguide would be advisable. Reading the",
          "An excellent museum which left you understanding everything that you needed to know about polar exploration.",
          "This museum was really informative and shed a lot of light on the history of sealing and whaling. You learn a lot about polar exploration and despite all displays not being in English as well, you will be given an English guidebook full of information.",

          "We visited the Polar Museum in November in Tromso and found it quite exciting. There was info. on The Arctic exploration, seal hunting for necessity and Arctic life.",
          "Learn about the hunting and exploration of the Norwegian peoples history, a lot of effort has been put into the displays, worth a visit, it is only small so can fit in the visit with 90 mins.",
          "Opportunity to find out more about people and place history, travelers and researchers, interesting exhibits and extensive explanations for them.",
          "We've visited couple of other places and museums in Tromso but this one was definitely the number one spot! Although I am not a supporter of violence against the animals, I was very interested to see the exposition, which shows you clearly the history of hunting and life in the",
          "A small museum, well presented showing polar exploration, and some of the former exploits of man. Unsurprisingly mainly the arctic, but a bit on the Antarctic too. Most of the labels are in Norwegian but a handy English leaflet is available. Worth an hour!",
          "There was so much information in this museum about the exploration and explorers of the region. It was well set out and the displays were really great. I would consider this a must do.",
          "Museums are not normally my thing but when one is walking around Tromso in a bitter winter wind at -5% any detour indoors is very welcome and to my great surprise I really enjoyed this little museum.Its not very expensive to get in and its full of the regions history as whalers",
          "This was the first stop of our Trip from our Cruise. To be honest, I would not have chosen to visit but it was okay. It showed a lot of history of Tromso and most of the museum was in written in Norwegian but we were lucky that our guide gave us an overview. Lots of stuffed",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. So informative and really well set out with many good graphics and displays. The museum gives you a great insight into Norwegian and Sami culture. Very informative on many Polar expeditions which set out from Tromso. Highly recommend you visit.",
          "Spent an interesting couple of hrs here. Has great displays about Norwegian polar exploration and also polar hunting. Guides provided in different languages as most displays in Norwegian.",
          "I guess this would largely depend on the tour guide, but I struck it lucky. There is so much to learn about the past activities in Norway's Arctic Regions. Visitors gain the most by being tolerant of previous sanctioned activities and can learn of the hardships faced, the",
          "This museum is not too big but gives an nice overview of what happened at the north poles. Since everything is written in Norwegian, you get a small booklet with the translation. This was very helpful and made this museum a nice experience! Something you need to visit when you",
          "A well presented museum however could benefit with more translations innEnglish. Possibly audio commentary.",
          "A great small museum with lots of interesting exhibits (and stuffed animals) detailing the history of Arctic exploration and hunting. Buy the combined ticket with the Tromso University Museum.",
          "A very interesting Museum covering the story of Road Amundsen's trip to the North Pole and Life in general in the Artic conditions. Really worth a visit and is very interesting. If you are 67 then you qualify for concessionary entrance.",
          "Relatively small museum with lots of interesting perspectives of polar life. Given an English guide to use in the museum but some more English translated signage next to the exhibits would have helped.",
          "Museum has plenty of exhibits. Most is not translated to English. You are given a booklet to read to describe exhibits. Warning there are details of seal hunting, trapping and killing walruses but it is part of their history.",
          "We did a polar history walk organised through our Norwegian Cruise line. A beautiful lit city but rain and sleet the whole time. The museum was informative but do not like to hear about the way animals had been massacred in vast numbers by these explorers. Today they are still",
          "In this museum you can learn all about tromso and all about polar expeditions,so amazing to learn how people in that times live with all they have,so much things to see and learn in this polarmuseet.",
          "I\u2019m not sure what I expected this Museum to be but I didn\u2019t expect it to be full of stuffed animals. I love animals and I didn\u2019t like this place! We didn\u2019t stay long, the Seals eyes were looking at me! There were wolves, polar bears, seals etc. I know this was normal for them to",
          "This small museum stood head and shoulders above a similar museum in Oslo. Its forte was an in-depth and narrow focus on a few polar expeditions. Well done Polarmuseet.",
          "We hoped to get more of an insight into the region and it was informative but not inspiring and the English booklet was a little dull... If you don't like stuffed animals it's best avoided! It is a little brutal but then so was the way of life of the arctic circle.",
          "Wonderful displays and detailed history of Polar expeditions. So much to see. Plan on spending several hours to get details or quick walk-through for a great overview. Very nice layout, professionally displayed in very old red wharf building which adds to the allure. Extremely",
          "Quite fascinating displays from the obvious Roald Amundssen to the different breeds of seals and their skins. Veri informative even if a lot isn't translated from Norwegian.",
          "It's nice to see some stories of the north pole explorers, but should be nice to see more real furniture.",
          "A good museum about polar life, with an emphasis on hunting and trapping. This means that children or sensitive animal lovers might be disturbed by the exhibits. If you can accept them in their historical context, it is very informative. Could use better and more extensive",
          "The Polar museum has exhibitions that explain much about the history of Norway, its people, its animals/fish, the expeditions by its explorers and climate change. I definitely recommend it!",
          "Worth a short visit. Lots of exhibits not translated, but interesting to look at nonetheless. History of Amundsen's treks is fascinating. Good exhibits recreating gory hunting past - kids loved that!",
          "It was good to see factual representation of history even though some was harsh. Well presented and in an interesting building.",
          "The museum provides quite a lot of information related to wildlife in the arctic. Loads of information is also available about the various expeditions through centuries for whaling, sealing and other commercial explorations and lifestyle in the arctic through the same period.",
          "Nice little museum with many informations about the North. There is a lot to see, from stuffed animals to a rebuilt cottage and ship models. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Really glad I went here. Museum gave some interesting information about polar exploration and was a nice and cheap activity. The only downsides is that the book that they give you that explains the exhibits in English was filled with grammar/spelling errors and was something",
          "The museum was very interesting and informative. It showed the history of Norway\u2019s arctic region and polar exploration. It had lots of displays and had a guide book in English to make it easy to work you way around.",
          "The Polar museum is a must for those interested in deeper knowledge about 2 Norwegian explorers in particular ( Amundsen& Nansen), and about Norwegian pioneering expeditions and seal hunting in general. The ground floor is dedicated to early history about life and hunting in",
          "The museum building is located by the sea so we quite enjoyed to walk to. The exhibition is about the arctic life in early 20th century. very interesting.",
          "We loved this polar museum. It told us a lot about polar exploration we didn't know and was well worth the time spent. It made us feel like \"old hands\" when we visited the Fram/Gjoa museum in Oslo, as we had become acquainted with the basics in Tromso.",
          "It was well laid out, but a little too hot inside although they did have coat and bag storage which was definitely required. Great to get to know the history of the region but with stairs probably not suitable for everyone",
          "Really great museum about life and living in the Arctic. Could use some more English translations, but the book they provided was a great reference for what we were seeing. Plan on spending at least an hour here going through all the rooms and topics.",
          "The hunting of seals and whales is a sensistive subject, but this museum did a good job of putting it into the perspective of the city's, and country's history. I learned a lot about Arctic Explorers and really enjoyed the story of the woman taxi driver Wanny Waldstad who was",
          "Really interesting history of polar exploration from whaling through to Amundsen and beyond. You do need not to be judgmental about whaling etc. The displays are very interesting and there is lots to take in. Not ideal for young children as not a hands on type of museum. There",
          "This is a very interesting museum that takes the visitor through the walrus and seal hunting history of Norway as well as highlighting the life and work of Roald Amundsen.",
          "Well presented, a lot to see, English booklet almost too much to absorb as well as view. Much history and brings the hardship of the Arctic into reality.",
          "A very good experience with some interesting exhibits explaining Norway's Polar Exploration Adventures. The museum gives a true feeling of the hardships and problems encountered by these intrepid explorers.",
          "This museum tells you about polar expeditions. Especially, I remember the rooms dedicated to fur hunters who would stay over winter on Polar islands.",
          "The museum has a very wide range of exhibits relating to Norway and the Arctic. There are several dioramas of Arctic life, and numerous exhibits which were actually used on expeditions. The atmosphere is excellent, and the museum very informative and well worth a visit. It is",
          "Whilst the quality of the displays are excellent there is limited English translations. The museum is small and was over crowded on the rainy day that we visited. I would advise going to a different museum in Tromso unless you have a guide who can provide commentary.",
          "This is a short stop-over to Tromso. It's not a huge museum so don't expect too much but you'll get to see lot's of dead animal skins. It's quite difficult to understand the flow since there's not much english translation. They give you an English booklet which is quite long to",
          "Worth visiting-- it ums up the area well and you can have your photo taked next to a polar bear (stuffed!) Buy a combined ticket fopr a ll the museums and cable car.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this museum. Fascinating displays about Norwegian Polar explorers and hunting. They gave us an English packet when we walked in that had a little material for each room we visited. I was pretty obvious, however, that there was way more explanation on",
          "Raining and an impromptu pop in to the museum , located about 300 metres from the warf. . This is a small but very interesting museum with lots of info on climate change , sea ice formation , history on the discovery of the north and south poles . Stuffed huskies ,sea lions",
          "The museum was very interesting and gave you a good insight into early life in the region. Many of the signs not in English and our visit enhanced by all the stories by a local guide.",
          "We were fortunate to have a local guide for some of the exhibits. Amazing amount of history and information in a small place. This was all in a rustic two-story structure with rooms at many different levels. The Norwegians have a long history of exploration, especially at",
          "Great location and nice building, with a wooden je-ne-sais-quoi who takes you right into an exploration atmosphere. A lot of information and many objects are in display. 2 hours if you wanted to read everything. Nevertheless, it might be time for a make over. Audioguides,",
          "You can learn about the early (hard) living in the Arctic. Hunting, survival and explorations. Also there was at the time a very interesting exhibition about the importance of the northern icecap.",
          "Tromso was the starting point for many Arctic Expeditions. This museum highlights late 19th and early 20th century exploration of Arctic regions. The third floor is devoted to the Fridtjof Nansen expedition and his ship the Fram. Second floor is for Amundsen and aerial",
          "This was a fascinating visit; there is very little information in English but we had a wonderful guide called Morganne and I should like to recommend her if you are on a trip where you need to ask for a guide. We were on a cruise and thus it was organised by them and not us as",
          "An interesting museum which would have more to offer foreign visitors if information was provided in English as well as Norwegian. You are given a sheet in English but it covers only a fraction of what there is to see.",
          "Small museum but packed with history of exploring the polar regions. Pretty interesting. One drawback is space. If there are more than one large group in the place it gets very difficult to navigate your way through the exhibits. You can explore in an hour or take a few",
          "This museum concentrates on Arctic trapping and hunting on the ground floor. The 1st floor is mostly about exploration of the North Pole with particular emphasis on Roald Amundsen's attempts at the North and South Poles and displays about Henry Rudi and Wanny Woldstad, the",
          "A very interesting museum, lot of history about Norway and Arctic in general. Unfortunately all the information is in local language, and at the entrance they give you a small book in your language with some description of what you are going to see, but sometimes it's difficult",
          "Mainly about arctic expedition, polar life. The museum is small, but has a lot of items, so it takes about one hour or more to check everything.",
          "This is a wonderful exhibit with so much amazing memorabilia. Some of the exhibits are a touch gruesome but that is what it was like in those early days. You have to admire the men and women exploring the polar areas. You could easily spend a couple of hours here as there is so",
          "Rather disappointing. Exhibits rather worn. Do you want to see polystyrene seagulls with fake guano? The real animals were nice when you caught a glimpse of them. Don't rush here",
          "Although hunting is frowned upon theses days, this is a fascinating exhibition showing the terrible conditions that early explorers faced in the Arctic. The MV Polstjerna is a little further along the quay.",

          "Fascinating museum with so many varied and unexpected things to see - sealing hunting is not something for faint hearted but was part of the history. If u wanted to one could spend hours - would be good for families, school trip there whilst we were there. Outdoor clothes can be",

          "Nothing much to see but at Tromso it is a must visit attraction for tourist. We enjoyed this museum,",
          "Very interesting museum with a lof information about the arctic and svalbard. It takes around an hour to visit the museum and it can be combined with a walk on the seaside.",
          "There is so much interesting stuff in this museum about the arctic explorers and life between Tromso and Svalbad from its discovery until now. We spent an hour in there and could have spent longer if it weren't for the crowds of tourist groups taking over.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the inside of this old building as well as the exhibits. The history is interesting- watch your head as the door frames are original and low!",
          "This was a disappointing museum. The flow of the museum doesn't make much sense. The English guide (remember to ask for it!) really leaves you floundering. Also if you are an individual traveller you may be denied or delayed entry in favour of groups. That said i appreciated",
          "I called it excellent but - much of it is about how anything that could be hunted was hunted, and some still is. So be warned. A lot about the mechanics of killing, arctic foxes crushed with deadfall traps and polar bears shot in the face by gun traps are things that stand out",
          "A most informative display that tells what it was like in the arctic when explorers were seeking to reach the poles. Also the conditions that the indigenous people had to endure to settle and live in such an extreme environment. Well worth the visit.",

          "I enjoyed the museum very much. I have an interest in polar explorers already and there was a lot I already knew, but there was a lot a new information provided. The one downside was that a lot of the exhibits didn't have a translated description. Thankfully I was with my Danish",
          "As we went in we thought it might not be very interesting, but it got more and more so as we progressed round the series of rooms. There are many displays of original artefacts from early polar exploration. We especially enjoyed the well documented stories of Amundsen and Nansen",

        "wiki": "Tromsdalen Church or the Arctic Cathedral (Norwegian: Tromsdalen kirke, Ishavskatedralen) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. It is located in the Tromsdalen valley on the east side of the city of Troms\u00f8. It is the church for the Troms\u00f8ysund parish which is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland. The modern concrete and metal church was built in a long church style in 1965 by the architect Jan Inge Hovig. The church seats about 600 people.\n\n\n== Name ==\nFormally, the church is named Tromsdalen Church or sometimes Troms\u00f8ysund Church (Norwegian: Tromsdalen kirke or Troms\u00f8ysund kirke). The church is commonly nicknamed the Ishavskatedralen which literally means \"The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea\" or simply the \"Arctic Cathedral\". Despite its nickname, it is a parish church and not, in fact, a cathedral as it is commonly called.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe church was designed by the architect Jan Inge Hovig and is built mainly of concrete. The main contractor for the construction was Ing. F. Selmer A/S Troms\u00f8.  Because of the church's distinct look and situation, it has been called \"the opera house of Norway\", likening it to the famous Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia.  The church is one of the most notable churches in Troms\u00f8 due to its design, although Troms\u00f8 does have another church of interest, Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, which is noted for being the only wooden cathedral in Norway.\nThe groundbreaking of the church was 1 April 1964 and it was completed in 1965. The new church was consecrated on 19 November 1965 by the Bishop Monrad Norderval. The church is built out of cast-in-place aluminium-coated concrete panels.In 1972, a glass mosaic was added to the eastern side, made by Victor Sparre. The church acquired an organ built by Gr\u00f6nlunds Orgelbyggeri in 2005, with three manuals, pedal, 42 stops, and 2940 pipes. It replaced the old opus nr. 12 organ delivered by Vestlandske Orgelverksted, Hareid, which had 22 voices and 124 keys.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Troms\nChurch of Norway\nTroms\u00f8 Cathedral \u2013 the Cathedral of the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Arctic Cathedral",

          "The cathedral is easily accessible from the cruise ships by public transportation. We just happened to arrive at the church in time for the daily summer organ concert (NOK 80). It was lovely. The organist was wonderful and the accoustics were great.",
          "Beautifully designed, well maintained, excellent experience. At night as seen from a small ship out for the Northern Lights, it is striking. Worth the time.",
          "We walked across the bridge in the early evening. The building looks very pretty from the outside under lights. We went back the next day to go inside and it was so disappointing. Sure it is a beautiful stained glass window, but with the altar and other bits and pieces,",
          "We visited the Arctic Cathedral for one of the 11pm Northern Lights concerts and this was one of my favourite activities whilst in Tromso. We booked online but one of the members of staff said it never sells out, so you could easily turn up and buy a ticket on the door. The",
          "Midnight concert on Hurtigruten voyage, very atmospheric, beautiful performance by very talented trio. Expensive trip (like everything in Norway!!) but well worth it.",
          "I think it is one of these places you have to visit if in Tromso just to say that you have been to the Arctic Cathedral. Architecturally it is quite stunning in its simplicity. Inside the space is dominated by the stained glass window.",
          "We walked here from central Tromso over the bridge, alternatively a bus does operate the same route. Good for photos outside. We paid to go in 50 NOK (I think) and was a bit disappointed. It was simply a large stained glass window!",
          "We booked the midnight concert as part of our trip on the Hurtigruten. A simple but fantastic experience. The Cathedral is simple and the predominantly folk based programme was beautifully performed and perfectly in keeping. We loved it.",
          "This cathedral is well worth a visit! So modern & yet also spiritual. Beautiful! Very helpful lady in the ticket office too. And they sell stamps to go with postcards! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
          "This big triangle-shape building is a sight to behold, inside and out. The front facade is all glass so it is very impressive all lit up at night. You can see this lit-up triangle from mid-span of the Tromso Bridge - awesome. The inside of the cathedral is modern and impressive.",
          "\u00a34 to enter. Very peaceful. Do not expect an old fashioned building. This is very modern and the architecture in my opinion is very clever.",
          "Impressive building both inside and out, stop for a while and enjoy the architecture before you head up to the cable car.",
          "Took the bus to see this cathedral, far too windy to walk across the bridge. Bit disappointing really, architecturally a lovely building, different. Inside, quite plain but with stunning stained glass. Price to get in 50K with no concessions. Open 2nd January - 31st March 1 -",
          "An absolutely stunning cathedral. When you get into the main room the way the light comes into the room is astonishing. A definetely must do in Troms\u00f8.",

          "Looks great at day or at night. Front view totally different from side view. One of the top attractions here. Close to the bridge. You may walk from Tromsoe city center to the ice cathedral. It takes around half an hour over the bridge or a few minutes by bus.",
          "OK, if you're going to Tromso you'll probably come here because it is the most iconic landmark in the city. The building's unique architecture and imposing location really do make it a must-see attraction. We came to it from the cable car which provides a different",
          "Visited the Arctic Cathedral for a choir performance, which was impressive. Most of the service was in Norwegian but that didn\u2019t bother me. The church itself is beautiful. A must do if there\u2019s a performance and you are visiting!",

          "This is an extraordinary piece of architecture, and a must see on any visit to Tromso. However, it is much less impressive inside than out, and the entrance fee is expensive. Enjoy from the outside, but don't bother paying to go in!",

          "Stopped here on way back to Troms\u00f8 Centre from cable car. About \u00a35.00 to enter but so beautiful with piles of snow outside in the polar night. Pitch black at 3pm. Very stark interior but amazing at the same time. Highly recommend.",
          "A modern cathedral featuring timber and mosaic glass. Very pretty with the mountains and snow in the background. Visited on the way to to the Fjellheisen cable car. It\u2019s an easy 20 minute walk from the harbour across the Troms\u00f8 bridge. Careful of icy paths.",
          "We were here in November and there was a good covering of snow which adds to the atmosphere of the building. The architecture is simple and very effective, I believe it is inspired by the shape of a local island. Inside it is also clean and simple with lots of light wood and a",

          "The Arctic cathedral is stunning by day or night - we made it a point of visiting at both times, since this building is so unique. We paid the entrance fee to go in for 30 minutes or so, take pictures and soak in the beauty. It\u2019s absolutely worth a visit!",
          "This beautiful Church is especially nice at night, when it is lit up and the stained glass windows in the back show up really nice. I know the architect didn't like the addition of the stained glass windows but it is really beautiful at night with the light showing through",

          "This is a very modern built cathedral and looks better far away than up close. Design good but material are relatively common. 50kr for adults to enter and there are some post cards , books and magnets to purchase. Toilets are down stairs. Look back at the church organ up on the",

          "I attended yesterday, mainly to have a quite moment with the Man Above.. I was horrified that the cost, to pray, was 50nok. NO exceptions for children or seniors. Not only was, is there NO information about the cathedral, it's history, what they do currently, NOTHING! It",
          "Loved to see it! So interesting not only outside, but inside too. We found inside some rehearsal of songs for a weding. Very intersting, white, a lot of light and the glass wall amazing. A must see in Tromso!",
          "The modern architecture looking from outside and the painted glass inside is so different to the traditional church. It looks more like an exhibition piece fir modern artists.the metal work within is also so different and modern. A must visit for all.",
          "This is worth a visit if you are in the area. The architecture, the stained glass, and the organ shape are all modern, clean lines. We were fortunate that the muscians were practising for an upcoming concert. If you can, visit for a concert.",
          "A spectacular design and prime location make this church a prominent building in central Tromso and a building that has rapidly become one of the symbols of Tromso. Also called Tromsdalen Church, this parish church is part of the Church of Norway, although it is not a cathedral.",
          "A modern cathedral design that attracts both young and old because of the large mosaic and the localization. Take the bus - the bridge is not healthy to walk on.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful in spite of many visitors. I always find it strange to pay to visit a church, but it was worth it.",
          "Included on most city tours the Artic Cathedral is definitely worth a visit. Across the bridge from the town it makes for a nice photograph from the harbour. Inside it is very modern with clean lines, impressive accoustics and a large beautiful stained glass window. They hold",
          "When you imagine a church you think at something old. It is completely different, modern and very interesting construction. But pay to enter in a church, even this, is unacceptable",
          "The Arctic Cathedral (Ishavskatedralen) has a bus stop right outside, and plenty of parking in the back. It's located right off the east end of the Tromso Bridge (Troms\u00f8brua). The church does charge a small fee to take photos inside. It's worth it though. The architecture is",
          "We made two visits to the Cathedral on our two week voyage with Hurtigruten. The first was part of a city tour, and this gave us a good opportunity to look around and admire the Cathedral\u2019s features including the stained glass window, chandeliers and the organ. The second was",
          "The cathedral, completed in 1965, is constructed in the shape of a Sami hut. Sami are indigenous people to this area of Norway. Its white exterior is representative of a glacier. Inside you will find the largest stained-glass window that covers the entire wall and is 75 feet",
          "This unique building certainly dominates an already beautiful landscape. We were fortunate to visit early and could take the time to enjoy the building. Ahtough anentrance fee is required,it's worth the price. Enjoy the dramatic ceiling and beautiful window behind the altar.",
          "The situation and the unusual (for this part of the world) architecture draws you to it. And it's well worth a look at. However, it's not a place that keeps you - modern, but no presence. The old cathedral church in the town is the one that has the ordinary look, but inside has",
          "I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. The church overlooks the town and is impressive on the hill and can be seen from all over but inside it is just average. There was a big organ that someone was playing but I was disappointed there just wasn't more to this",
          "This striking building dominates the skyline of Tromso, more so because it is in a residential area and on a ridge overlooking the harbour. The architecture is the attraction and the story of it's construction is very interesting. it is an absolute must-do if in Tromso, in fact",
          "One of the places to visit in Tromso, especially due to the exterior somewhat resembling Sydney Opera House, but underwhelming in the interior compared to most European churches. Cost was about $6 per adult with no senior discounts available. Credit cards taken. No brochure",
          "Our visit to the Arctic Cathedral was near midnight on a long frigid arctic night. Had it been just to see the building, I would have been disappointed. The word Cathedral does not have the same significance in the Norwegian Church that it holds for Catholic or Anglican",
          "Great place and ici, look at it from the outside. Nothing much to see in and pricey to go in. Great views from outside.",
          "This cathedral is nice on the outside, especially with the midnight sun shining on the front. However, the inside is cold and unwelcoming. It doesn't have the warmness of other cathedrals and maybe is a little too 'modern'. We went to a Midnight Sun Concert which was 200NOK. The",
          "The artic cathedral is one of the iconic sights from the harbour, perhaps 30minute walk from town. It is small in size, but the colours of the light entering the cathedral are wonderful, excellent location to view the main road bridge and harbour, also right next to the cable",
          "This stunning white cathedral is definitely the most beautiful thing to see in Troms\u00f8. It\u2019s also very hard to miss, as it sits on a rise at the mainland end of the Troms\u00f8 bridge. As beautiful as it is on the outside, the stained glass window inside is even more beautiful.

          "One of the iconic landmark of Tromso, a must photograph structure with a beautiful modern Scandinavian design. I was photographing it twice, both day and night but in my personal opinion night time will give you a splendid result. It was in December and the city was covered by",
          "A modern building it looks spectacular from Tromso & the bridge. Not impressive from inside & definitely should not be charged an entrance fee.",
          "Beautiful church and architecture. The natural light and the stained glass in the main sanctuary was gorgeous. I bet seeing a concert in that space would have been beautiful. Good to see. Minimal fee to go in but worth seeing.",

          "We visited during May when the sky was bright. There was a 5 NOR (about \u00a34) charge each for entry. We sat in there and admired the stain glass window for about 5 minutes. Have to say, I disagree with charging people to go into the house of God no matter how small the charge.",
          "Being the most iconic place of Tromso, it is charged for its entrance.Where does this happen? Entrance fees for a church?? Totally commercialised with a cafe and kids play area in a Church!!",
          "Went to a midnight concert at this cathedral. It was truly amazing and the highlight of a terrible Hurtigruten Cruise",
          "Located on the far side of the bridge into Tromso, it\u2019s a distinctive design. Worth a snap for any architecture fans.",
          "The simplicity of the architecture is the masterpiece - the stained glass reminds me of Klimt .Well worth a look inside .",
          "The Arctic Cathedral was an unexpected, dramatic sight against the dark background of a mountain ridge as our ship entered the harbor at Tromso. I took an easy bus ride from the ship to attend an afternoon organ concert. The hall has excellent acoustics. The organ is built in",
          "Interesting to see at night from afar. Not worth paying 50 nok to go inside. I wouldn\u2019t even make it a stop at all if it wasn\u2019t on the way to the cable car. There are magnificent churches all around the world for free - very disappointing.",
          "We walked on the bridge towards the Cathedral which offered a nice view. It was much more prettier from across the bridge and outside than inside. There was really nothing much to see inside and we felt the 50 NOK was too expensive and not worth paying.",
          "As others have said, from the outside this church is beautiful, a great spectacle and well worth seeing. The walk across the bridge is nice and seeing the church appear larger as you approach is amazing. However it is expensive to go inside ( 50 NOK , approx \u00a34.50) and we took",
          "I can't say i was that impressed with the cathedral itself ... I actually found the outside more interesting than the interior. Fortunately, I attended a spectacular concert that eliminated any negative feelings about the building itself. I wouldn't advice spending the time or",
          "This is one of the main attractions of Tromso but the architecture is great only if you look at it from outside. We stayed in the center of Tromso so we walked on the bridge which connects the Tromso island with the area where the cathedral and cable car are. We did not enter",
          "more than a cathedral. ..a little church compared to the churches in Italy ... nothing to see inside. ..and above all 5 euros thrown away ... makes the outside look better!",
          "I am sure there is a reason why the cathedral has only certain hours when is open, but that disappointed us. It would be nice if one could walk in, have a moment of silence and aknowledge the beauty we were entrusted on this Earth.",
          "Best to go here on the way to Fjellheisen as it is on the same bus route. It is also possible to walk from the city centre, but it will take around 20+ minutes and the wind can be quite strong while crossing the bridge. Need to pay if you want to go inside the cathedral itself.",
          "We have decided to see the cathedral before leaving, as it was a quick road from our accommodation - we did not regret! If you get to see it at night it is even better!",
          "We looked at it from the outside on our way back from the fjellheisen. It's nice and modern, but it looks more special from the distance at night/well, in the dark. To get in you have to pay, but I wouldn't know what for. You can see the windows through the window3s from the",

          "We joined the group from the Cruise liner Budicca and went to the Cathedral for a short operatic concert and of course to look at the Cathedral. The music was very good and singer was first class. The building itself is unique. Looks a like a toblerone chocolate. The",
          "Most impressive viewed from the outside and across the water. The stain glass window is striking but the rest of the Church is stark. I prefer the delightful wooden church in the city centre.",

          "If it hadn\u2019t been my 60th birthday, I might not have paid such a steep price (app. $50 for two tickets) for a concert that lasts just 30 minutes. But I wanted to end the day with something special, and this did turn out to be a lovely concert. An enchanting combination of",
          "The cathedral is quite nice but extremely underwhelming and, in my opinion, not worth the entrance fee if there is no concert going on. We went in, spent probably 10 minutes looking a the stained glass and then left.",
          "We visited here for the midnight concert arranged by hurtigruten, what a beautiful evening. It is an amazing structure being such an unusual shape, the acoustics are fantastic, perfect for the organist, pianist, saxophonist and singer to perform in. A great place to visit even",
          "I don't like churches where I have to pay an entry fee - and in this case we did pay. It was not worth paying 50 NOK to enter the church, you can see the altar through the window - you don't see much more when you are inside.",
          "Lovely Cathedral with a very impressive stained glass window. The Cathedral is spectacularly light up at night.",
          "This building is very iconic from outside, and it is really simple inside. It is nice to see and located in a great place, with nice views over Troms\u00f8. Worth the visit for the views, maybe not for the building itself",
          "Beautiful building and fun to take pictures of the outside. Inside looking quite boring through the glass, but I was quickly told that I had to pay the entrance fee if I wanted to take pictures of the inside, with a long lecture about that I should have known as it is clearly",
          "Very unusual and striking cathedral... but would not pay to go. I was hoping there would be more information about the cathedral but I didn't find anything. Very modern and minimalistic, not much to see. Was in and out in 5 minutes pretty much.",
          "Visited during city tour of Tromso with Hurtigruten Cruise. Beautiful from a distance, and surrounded by snow, just after sunset. Views across to the city spectacular. Lovely West End stained glass window. Better from the outside, than the interior",
          "50 nok to visit the church. Not worth the money to be honest , but beautiful architecture nonetheless . Tourist trap.",
          "I was there for listening the Norther lights concert. It was absolutely stunning. The place is so unique, quiet and simple but enlightened.I would definitely go again.",
          "Religion is supposed to be about faith, but when you have to pay 5\u20ac to pay your respects, the business underlying comes up. Half an hour walk over the bridge for this disappointment.",
          "Costs nk50 for 2 mins inside. Better off to just view from outside easy to walk from Troms\u00f8 20mins over the bridge",
          "Beautiful place for a stopover. Not much to do for the price. You can sit for a while, or take some photos. There\u2019s nothing that explains the history or background unless you sneak read a book in the gift shop. We stayed 20 minutes and that was plenty.",
          "We came here and it is a beautiful cathedral. Very open and bright, this is a magical place to come and sit as well.",
          "It definitely stands out as the architecture is very different in comparison to the other buildings around. The interiors are modern but have seen better interiors and its smaller than you would expect.",
          "best view of stained glass is from outside & this gives the best appreciation of the window. very plain interior but very atmospheric.",
          "Had to make two trips to the cathedral to go inside, since it is not open in the morning. Its interior did not move me a bit, Vast, imponent, but cold. A smaller old catholic church in the town center has a much more involving atmosphere.",
          "A wonderful, modern building - its architecture reflecting modern Scandinavia and the surrounding landscape. Visited in the daytime AND at midnight for a concert. Fabulous!",
          "If most of Tromso is on the west side of the water, this is on the east of the water. I walked across the bridge in the pouring rain. it takes about 20 minutes from the centre of town to here Was it worth it? yes and no. Even from a distance, you can see it is a beautiful",
          "We walked across the bridge to see this cathedral but it was closed and not much to look at through the windows. Concert nights are held here but not worth a special trip to visit.",
          "Would not recommend this as a must. Looks way better from outside. Not worth paying for to enter. Could also be the lack of natural light.",
          "Nicknamed a cathedral, but it's actually a church - and a rather beautiful one at that. I loved the way the light enters through the side windows on even a dull day. NB costs to get in...",
          "This church is separated from most of the town by a bridge over the fiord. Despite its modern concrete design it looks very attractive when lit up at night. Didn\u2019t go to the midnight concert as we felt it was too expensive but friends who did said it was lovely.p",
          "It is wonderful to visit to see this unusual looking work church. Make sure you check timings before visiting, because it\u2019s has wedding etc .... so sometimes closed.",
          "Beautiful stained glass window. Small. Looks great from the outside. Nice during cold weather \ud83d\ude09. You can get there by walking through the bridge or take a bus (50 nok one way!)",
          "Took a walk over the bridge from our hotel to get a closer look to this outstanding building. Certainly a defining landmark in Tromso",
          "Aside the architecture, which is quite interesting, nothing much to see. Do come in the evening when it is all liteen up.",
          "Popular site, good to stop off for a few pictures after a walk across the bridge on the way to the cable car. We didn\u2019t go inside",
          "The Artic Cathedral is very easy to spot from Tromso and the locals were telling us about it saying it was worth a visit and it definitely was! It was really cheap to get in as it is a \u00a35 donation to go towards the up keep of the cathedral and the stain glass window, the organ",
          "Overlooking the bridge leading to the old town of Trams\u00f8 this beautiful church deserves a quaick visit if you walk to the Cable Car from the Troms\u00f8 Old Town.",
          "It's a different and nice cathedral. Good place to sit down for 15 minutes and discover details in the fantastic glass mosaic. One thing I would not do again is walk across the bridge. So much airpollution and noise. Take the bus back to town.",
          "It is well worth the approximately 1km walk over the bridge to visit the Arctic cathedral, a modern yet inspiring church, both inside and out, with the stain glass windows a particular feature. But perhaps the highlight is to attend a midnight concert. The timing is set to",
          "It is a modern piece of architecture inspired from the surrounding landscape. When we visited in winter it was snow covered everywhere so was postcard like beautiful. Interiors was expectedly modern. there is a small entry fee.",
          "There's is an entrance fee of 50NOK. Oslo city has great church and its free. If u are into church you may pay the money and look inside. There's window for u to see through also to see what's inside the church. Other than that its great to take pic from outside.",
          "This isn't really a cathedral, but is an interesting focal point for the community. All types of concerts are held there as well as meetings and such as well as church services regularly. The stained glass is quite beautiful.",
          "We would skip this one. Was not much to see. They charged to enter and it is really just a very average church.",
          "Beautiful architecture and very unique. Shame it was closed but nevertheless worth seeing it from the outside.",
          "This was the sole reason I paid huge sums of money to go on the Hurtigruten Tromso city tour; it was dark and there had been a heavy snow fall, so it seemed easier to be taken there in a bus. In all honesty, the 20 minutes we were allocated was plenty. It was so beautiful and",
          "Pay in entrance. Its enough to see it from the outside.. nothing special inside unless you wanna light a candle",
          "Looks pretty from the outside, short opening times and not a lot to do when inside. The architecture is stunning, it looks 100 times better at night due to being lit up, also a good view over the bridge to Tromso.",
          "Worshiper's get in free and the rest of us have to pay 50 NOK. Not worth the money. Looked through the window and made my way to the cable car.",
          "We were lucky enough to attend a midnight service at this cathedral. The acoustics and atmosphere were fantastic as we listened to Norwegian classical music and folk songs.",
          "We didn\u2019t find anything interesting, you can take the pictures from outside with no need to spend de 50 NOK fee entrance.",
          "Walking distance from the centrum of Troms\u00f8 around 2.2 km. Very nice walk over the bridge. Cathedral itself nothing special, was closed for visitors, architecture very simple and for me to easy and too basic to say wow. Looking inside through the window the same feeling,",
          "Photograph it front side from the bridge. Photo of the rear stained glass is nice when it's dark. Could not see the point of paying the entrance fee when you can see in through the window.",
          "Since we have read reviews about there is nothing to see inside (and what more you have to pay an entrance fee) we decided just to stop by while walking from the inland to island. It is worth to see it but in my opinion it still looks better from the distance.",
          "This cathedral can be reached by bus from the main city in just about 5-10 minutes and is worth a visit.",
          "Very nice hill side church great build and shall look good for day and night photos. Only find entrance fee is bit dear",
          "Not worth it to go in! Architecture amazing structure... Beautiful views from outside. Inside boring .. Not much else to say. Stained glass window only visible with colors from outside structure",
          "Located at the end of the bridge when you come from city center to the residential area, it\u2019s a wonderful construction that totally deserves some minutes to admire. On the other hand I could not say the same about the interior. Nothing special or on my taste.",
          "We walked to the cathedral feom downtown, over the bridge. The church is nice but having to pay to go inside was disappointing.",
          "Stunning landmark, do not miss. We walked across the bridge to see it up close and take photos from the outside. We weren't able to attend a concert inside cathedral during our visit, but I would definitely have done it if I'd known about the show in time.",
          "Visit to the Arctic Cathedral was a natural place of visit in Tromso. We took a 15-20 mins walk from the City Centre and crosses the bridge of Tromso. Arctic Cathedral is situated nearer to the residential part of Tromso. As Tromso is a small place, Arctic Cathedral became a",
          "We tried to visit during regular visit hours (13:00-18:00) but found 50 NOK entrance fee a bit too expensive.",
          "We actually went indoors during the day, but the best view is after dark when it's all lit up. A good stop on a walk back from the cable car towards Tromso.",
          "During our trip on the Hurtigruten ship Polarys one of the excursions was to a midnight concert at the Arctic Cathedral. This is a great chance to see this beautiful cathedral. The concert lasted 30 minutes with a soloist, saxophonist and a pianist. The acoustics are said to",
          "As per title . It's 50 kroner each to visit and really should be donation only . It's small ,for a cathedral, and quirky,but that's it .",
          "Waiting for 3 hours, nothing happened. We were cold and hungry, decided to give up. While we were waiting at the bus stop, kP index suddenly rise and some aurora explosion happened.",
          "It's architecture was quite impressive. Tall triangular structure, well constructed. It's on a height and the view from here is excellent. The bridge connecting Tromso Island and mainland looks quite excellent. Quite a photogenic spot and we clicked lots of photos here. On",
          "We visited during our 4 day break. It\u2019s a nice spot to see but costs 50nok to get in (c\u00a35) per person. It\u2019s a beautiful building but we didn\u2019t pay to go inside as you can see through the windows at the front.",
          "This is an icon of the city. Even if you stop by for a minute, it\u2019s a wonderful place to visit. Concerts inside. Check the local schedules.",
          "Such an amazing design. The stained glass window is just beautiful and the the building itself so worth visiting.",
          "One of the few actual \"sites\" in Tromso to see. It's a cool walk across the bridge from town and looks great in pictures and from the outside. Very small and not much to see other than the one big stained glass window inside. Really wasn't worth the cost of admission unless you",
          "Modern exterior and interior, little cold atmosphere but still nice to see since there is the only Cathedral built at this latitude (350km northern to Polar Circle)",
          "We walked across Troms\u00f8 bridge during the day to the Cathedral, we didn't go in at this point, but we did have tickets for a New Year's Eve concert, which we had purchased online about a month prior to going. The concert lasted approx. 1 hour and consisted of some Sami folk",
          "You have to pay to go inside, even as a student or resident. The outside is more interesting and the Troms\u00f8 Domkirke on the island is better inside for a more historical and religious vibe.",
          "We visited the cathedral on 23/12 . We were impressed by the look of the building and although the inside was stunning - there wasn\u2019t any information about the cathedral unless you purchased a book. But we had the good fortune to hear a Norwegian singer and his band warming up",
          "It is one of the postcards of the city and its simple modern architecture is so beautiful looking from far or near. The only disappointment I had, was because when I visited (on Christmas days) it was closed for visitation (which I understand as contraditorio).",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture. It is simple and elegant. Being the church once you are inside you can experience the serenity. Really great Stained Glass work",
          "On our first visit we only walked around the outside which is incredibly beautiful! But when we returned this year we managed to fit in a proper visit; and despite being busy, we still found the Arctic Cathedral to be a very peaceful place. There is a tranquility and beauty that",
          "Definitely worth a visit for the beautiful architecture. There was a minimal fee to go inside as well.",
          "Beautiful way to finish 2018 and get inspired to start 2019. This was the concert at the Cathedral. Arctic Cathedral is very interesting in Troms\u00f8. Modern and full of light.",
          "The design of the cathedral is just beautifulboth from the outside and inside as well. Check out the stained glass and walk all the way round. It's a great spot for taking photographs of Tromso and the fjords.",
          "It\u2019s a usual church. The outside structure is very unique for photos, but nothing else to see inside.",
          "The architecture of this church is quite unusual, and it has a nice lighting installation, as was noted by other people here. However, all of this is not that special and not really worth the walk, and especially not worth the entry fee.",
          "We went to cathedral ticket booth to peer inside and it didn't appear to be worth it. When discussing with the staff what there was to see, she suggested it would probably be worth it in the summer months but not during winter when there is no sun coming through the windows.",
          "Great architecture. The cathedral is next to the Tromso bridge, really a landmark.The inside is spectacular!",
          "Just like the title, one of the reasons we wanted to come and visit Tromso was because I really want to see this magnificent Arctic Cathedral. It is as beautiful as how it\u2019s photographed in the photos you probably see on the internet. Stunning.",
          "Interesting for architecture lovers and a beautiful subject from the outside for the photographers. We didn't got the chance to see the sun rises through the strained glass window but we found it beautifull anyway. Not much to doo but if you are lucky you can catch a Christmas",
          "When the cathedral is open, the lights are on and the huge stained glass window glows. That plus the architecture is what you\u2019ll most enjoy seeing. We paid the steep 5NOK to go inside and regretted that, though it was a donation to the church. I\u2019d suggest you skip that and just",
          "This is a pretty sight looking across the water from Tromso. Not sure it is worth the view up close, or going in. The hours for entry are also a bit unpredictable and don't necessarily match the website if booked for a private function.",
          "This wonderful unmistakable landmark of Tromso is located facing the sea and town centre. You can walk from the hurtigruten terminal and hotels across. It takes about 25 minutes to walk. The design is stunning. Open from 1400 to 1800 during winter with services behind held",
          "50 NRK for visiting the church. Watch it from the outside - there is NOTHING inside - you can't se through the windows. Best seen in the night - with the lights and and the beautiful windows at the back",
          "It's ok. A bit interesting, but nothing special. We didn't really get the chance to see the interior because there's a Sunday service going on and we couldn't wait since it was so cold outside. However, it is a great vantage point to take some photos and we were lucky the sky",
          "The cathedral is an amazing building situated at a quiet neighborhood just across the city center. We took the bus 28 thats two way return. There was a service going on so we didn't want to go in to disturb them. Took some nice pictures and the walked to the nearby cable car",
          "Took the 30 min walk in cold morning winter (minus 5 degree C) to enjoy the views and feel the winter of Troms\u00f8. Iconic Arctic Cathedral is good for pictures and also for taking the harbour and mountains. Great views but layer up as with the strong will temperatures will go",
          "I walked to the Chapel from the cruise ship area. I enjoyed walking over the bridge, but that might be too much for someone who is not used to walking or if you have limited time. There was an entrance fee. The cathedral is beautiful inside and out.",
          "As with most Scandinavian countries, I found this church to be a departure from the normal shape and architecture of the churches found elsewhere. Its located right at the end of the Tromso bridge and you get good views of the city as well the bridge from the church.",
          "Beautiful church, but you actually get the most out of your visit by an outside view. Might be otherwise in the summertime though, when you get light from the outside.",
          "This was a really beautiful experience. We attended the Arctic Cathedral Midnight Concert and it was wonderful. The cathedral has excellent acoustics and the singers performances were delightful. Would recommend anyone to make the effort to get to the concert. Well worth a visit.",
          "Easy to walk to across bridge from city centre. In winter it is lit up and looks outstanding against the darkness of the winter skies. Steep concrete sides are interleaved with glass panels bringing lots of light into the church and highlighting the beautiful stain glass window",
          "A wonderful musical experience at midnight. this beautiful warm modern cathedral has the most amazing acoustics, no microphones were needed at all.",
          "This icon of Troms\u00f8 is worth a visit. Walk across the bridge from the town centre, or ride a bus for a couple of stops. An active cultural venue, the church hosts hundreds of concerts each year. Its midnight concerts in the summer and northern light concerts in the winter are",
          "We were on the Hurtigruten tour and chose the option to attend a midnight concert in this very modern cathedral. The stained glass window over the altar is rich in colour and design. The concert was excellent. The performers (3) used the accoustics in a great manner,",
          "So we decided to walk to the Arctic Cathedral across the bridge, which should take about 20 mins but we probably took longer due to the awesome views we kept stopping to check out! The cathedral itself reminded me Toblerone, it was definitely unique in style and while simple on",
          "The 30 minute walk over the bridge to the arctic cathedral was totally worth it. You not only get amazing views of the city and cathedral from the bridge but also get to see a beautiful sky colors if timed well (we went around 11 am). The architecture is amazing. We didnt get to",
          "A must see iconic land mark of Tromso, a culture deeply religious (mostly protestant). I also highly recommend some education in relation to the Sami people.",
          "Firstly we never planned to visit the cathedral but happened to pass it on route to the cable car. From a distance the building looks impressive, even more so when lit up. As we walked across the bridge the church is directly in front of you. It is very easy to spot on the",
          "The church has a striking appearance from the outside however they charge 50kr pp for entry and it is deeply underwhelming. I\u2019m always against churches charging admission, but this one isn\u2019t even nice inside. Even the stained glass window on the back of the church was better",
          "We saw the cathedral when it was dark and that was 3pm in the afternoon. All lit up it on a hill,overlooking Troms\u00f8 looks pretty spectacular. The cost to go in was around 59nok. A modern church inside not a traditional one with statues of saints etc. Its fairly plain with what",
          "It's Lovely to see it at night, it's so shiny but we don't enter inside. Its a really nice views from there",
          "The cathedral is spectacular from the outside and when viewed from a distance lit up. The stained glass window is nice. However we didn\u2019t pay the 50NOK entry fee as you could see through the windows. Worth a visit but don\u2019t allow too long to see it.",
          "We walked from our hotel at Clarion hotel The edge to this Cathedral and it took around 30 minutes walking across the bridge. We thought it opens at 1 pm but when we arrived we discovered it opens at 2 pm in November. It looks modern and different.",
          "A modern cathedral, this is situated opposite the main town, you can walk across a bridge to get there or catch the bus - check the opening times though as they vary by season. The stained glass window is fantastic, the cathedral is quite minimalistic but is also very pretty",
          "We made a last minute choice to visit the cathedral for a midnight concert. The acoustics were amazing. What we could see if the architecture was interesting although we couldn\u2019t appreciate the huge stained glass window due to lack of light",
          "Apparently some dude recording a music video is more important than the dozens of tourists waiting outside in the cold. The exact length of the delay mentioned on the note was also very helpful.",
          "It's a very nice Cathedral, specially when the lights are turn on but there is still some mild sunshine that allows you to still see the landscape behind. On night time, even when you don't get to see the landscape, the view is still amazing. In all honesty, the exterior is much",
          "Cruise port of call. Beautiful architecture, couldn't see inside because there was a funeral taking place.",
          "It\u2019s a very beautiful Cathedral with modern architecture. It can be reached from the city center by walking or by taking a bus. Bus stop is just in front of the cathedral. For bus fare pp it was 50 kroner for 1&1/2 hrs, chk it with the bus driver once u get into the bus u can",
          "My partner and I visited the cathedral after seeing it all lit up from our hotel across the other side of the water. It's a really beautiful building from the outside and is designed to look like an iceberg which is pretty cool. It's 50 NOK each to enter but unfortunately when",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is an imposing landmark on the opposite side of the bridge to Tromso. We walked across the bridge on a very cold day but it was worth it for the views and for the church itself. There was a small charge to get in but it is worth it. If you are in Tromso",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is in Tromso Norway but on the opposite side of the bridge to town centre of Tromso. From the town centre of Tromso it is a spectacular walk across the Tromso bridge to the cathedral which sits at the foot of the mountains. The cathedral was built in 1965",
          "The church is very easy to find as it is located on a small hill overlooking the town. It's a very modern, large and open space.",
          "We first spotted this from the window in our hotel room. It was intriguing during the day with the exquisite stained glass windows, but when we viewed it up close shining at night it was more spectacular.",
          "This church is pretty but you don't stay long. If we hadn't got free entrance using out Tromso Pass I am not sure we would have made the trip but nonetheless it was nice to go.",
          "this is well worth seeing - it is a beautiful cathedral and/or church with lovely glass stained windows",
          "Striking building but probably more interesting from the outside than inside. There's a 50nok entry free",
          "You can see it afar from the city centre. Went closer, it looks the same except nearer. I guess it is the one of the landmark in Tromso. Chose not to go in as you can peep through the glasses.",
          "walked to the arctic cathedral but it was closed so i didn't manage to go in. i think it opens at ? 3pm only. anyway u can peer in their windows, nothing very spectacular. it's nice to take pix outside though! proceeded to the cable car station after this!",
          "My wife and I, along with my wife's parents, visited the Arctic Cathedral during our recent 2 night visit to Tromso. We walked across the bridge from downtown Tromso and the entire walk took us about 20-25 minutes on a clear but windy day. The walk itself isn't difficult but",
          "Picture prior to visit made it seem more then it is. Looks great from a distance at night. Not so much up close during the day. It what it is.",
          "I have given 1 for the stain glass window. Was it worth the 10 NOK to see it? No. Just a modern church inside which took me about 30 seconds to see. If I was a spiritual person maybe it would have been different but when I compare it to some of the magnificent cathedrals of",
          "A beautiful cathedral and well worth the viist. If it is not windy walk over the bridge from the city and this is an experience in itself and nice to arrive at the cathedral.",
          "It was a good walk from the Tromso island up the bridge and back. The cathedral is modern, different, serene and of course, has great views, from outside and within.",
          "My husband and I went here because I was interested to see the Cathedral up close. It was really nice from the outside. If you want to enter, you have to pay. We paid 100 (?) NOK for both of us if I remember correctly in order to enter. The inside was nice, but if you are not",
          "We were lucky enough to enjoy a midnight concert in the Arctic Cathederal in Tromso. Visually stunning building inside and out. We enjoyed perfect sound reverberating through the triangular structure. A male vocalist accompanied by a flute player and a pianist using his big",
          "Worth a quick visit to see the beautiful stained glass window behind the altar. Take the bus from the city centre and walk back across the bridge for a great view of the sound.",
          "Check timings before you go. We waited until they opened after doing the cable car tour. Once inside, you pay for admission and church is small enough to look around for no more than 1/2 hr, unless you wanted to stay longer for private prayers. I imagine would be spectacular if",
          "Interesting architecture but little else to recommend about a visit. Probably much better to visit for a concert or church services. A band was doing a sound check for a concert of Christmas music that evening while we were there, and the acoustics were impressive.",
          "It is a beautiful building and the organ plays wonderful music. Not really worth the price and not much to see inside. Would only do if the weather is bad outside.",
          "The trip across the river from the island to the church across that amazing bridge was as much a part of the journey The church was closed when we were there but hey, we took some cool photos of the church and the scenes from the bridge",
          "Worth a visit to this most Northern of churches. Beautiful setting overlooking the water. Highly recommended.",
          "We took a walk to see the Cathedral and it was closed the view was very nice from the front. Be sure to check ahead and see if the building is open before you go.",
          "It is a beautiful place of worship located at a nice location. Serene place to be one with yourself. Beautiful pictures of our mother Earth in the gallery.",
          "It was a beautiful sunny day perfect for a visit. We arrived just after a service (it looked like a baptism) with a young baby girl the centre of attention. The church is stunning outside as is the inside. Don\u2019t just look towards the alter turn back and look up and see one",
          "This is a beautiful modern cathedral with stunning architecture inside and out. We were particularly impressed with the huge, artistic stained glass.",
          "In Norwegian its called Ice Ocean Cathedral and of course with the shape and the surface of the building you know and feel you are in the Arctic! But, don't forget to take a peek - at least - inside and you will have a nice, warm and color adventures from the both ends (looking",
          "While visiting some relatives in Tromso they took us to see the Arctic Cathedral Also know as Ishavskatedralen (don't ask me to pronounce ii). You can see it nearly anywhere in Tromso. There is a fee (50Kr) to go inside, that was somewhat of a surprise I never had to pay a fee",
          "This cathedral should be a \u2018must do\u2019 if you are in Tromso. The apparent simplicity of design deceives you into thinking it won\u2019t be very special but walking inside I was overwhelmed by its design. The stained glass window behind the altar is stunning with the message that it",
          "We got the bus over for the concert which was easy from Tromso centre. The concert features three musicians who played and sang a variety of local, National and international music. Some of the pieces gave us both goose bumps, they were beautiful. We were then incredibly",
          "This easy to get to church has amazing acoustics and a nice pipe organ. The stained glass is quite nice, and the seats are very comfortable.",
          "Interesting architecture but I guess looking a bit like an iceberg when you are above the Arctic Circle makes sense.",
          "This is a beautiful building that you don't see every day, being a church and not being religious I did not want to spend the 50 nok requested to visit it, so I did look only the outside. The architecture is beautiful and particular, and it has been built on a nice view point in",
          "Cathedral is a strong word that evokes certain images in one's mind. This does not match those expectations, bit is still very nice. It's a simple construction, as often described, with nothing too notable about it. The stain glass added behind the altar was put in against the",
          "We visited the cathedral during the day and found it to be pretty and fairly simple compared to many European cathedrals. This may be in part to how far north it s (small population) and that the Germans burned a lot of N. Norway to the ground in 1944. Still it is a pretty",
          "Wife and I stopped by. They charge a fee of 50Kr which was a bit of a surprise. Decent crowd at 10 am",
          "Never experienced before, church charching an entry fee. Excellent location and looks beautiful from the other side in the evening light.",
          "You need to purchase a ticket to go inside.. The fee is about $6 US there is not much to see inside, only the chadelier which is like a large icicle and the stained glass. You can see it from the outside thru a window.",
          "From our Hurtigruten ship we took a bus to this lovely church to hear a midnight concert. It was worth staying up for.",
          "We only viewed it from the outside, as you had to pay to get in. The outside was beautiful, even in gray weather.",
          "Nothing about this cathedral is worth visiting, its literally one small hall and nothing special about the architecture or design. Just takes pictures from the outside that\u2019s probably all you need. Again, do not waste your money, the picture attached is all you gonna see inside",
          "Worth visiting because of its unusual triangular design and simplicity which makes it unexpectedly beautiful. A charming view of Tromso and the bridge leading to it from its elevated entrance.",
          "We had wanted to attend to attend the midnight sun concert but it was sold out so we just stoped by to see the inside. It is a simple church with interesting architecture and a beautiful stain-glass window. I do find it interesting that many of the Scandinavian churches charge",
          "The organ and violin performance makes the entrance fee worth the money. It was beautiful. If you don\u2019t like classical music. From the outside you can also make wonderful pictures. The architecture is interesting.",
          "I went to a midnight concert in this beautiful cathedral which was absolutely amazing and highly recommended. I walked across the bridge which seemed a really long walk and then the Arctic Cathedral appeared at the end of the bridge,surrounded by mist.",
          "Seems to be a constant stream of visitors walking over the bridge or being dropped off by coaches when the cruise ships are in. You get great views of tromso when walking over the bridge but I wouldn\u2019t waste your money to enter the cathedral. You can see what\u2019s inside by looking",
          "OK, the modern design when viewed across the water from the main part of Tromso City is quite eye catching and, as you approach it on foot, it stands out against the green background of the surrounding hills. However, internally it is a little underwhelming apart from the one",
          "A mid 20th century church with great vistas and a powerful modern organ. Unless you are interested in modern architecture it is probably not worth making a special trip to see the Church BUT if you can arrange your visit to coincide with the 14:00hrs daily organ recital it is",
          "We could see the Cathedral easily from Troms\u00f8, and resolved to visit it during our stay in Troms\u00f8. We walked across Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the view of the Cathedral close up was even more impressive. Although we didn't go inside the Cathedral (a Service was on at the time) we walked",
          "You need to visit Ishavskatedralen. It is an amazing building and why not attend the Sunday service. It is conducted in Norwegian but easy to follow and enjoy.",
          "Visited as part of Globus tour.Globus paid for us to see this??? Majority of group 42 passengers cannot understand what you pay for?",
          "Beautifully designed on the outside, and a little disappointing inside. The midnight concert was wonderful.",
          "It is nice. It is scenic. Nothing negative to say about it. But without the context of a church with modern architecture next to a beautiful waterway across from a glittering island city linked by a gracefully arched cantilever bridge, it might not quite rank in the top ten of",
          "The Artic Cathedral stands out among all the small houses nearby, close to the shore of the Tromso fjord. It is a modern church with a large white cross inside the tepee-like construction. As it is modern church the interior is austere, but the stained glass shines and brings",
          "Stopped to take a few photos of this beautiful, iconic church on our visit to Troms\u00f8 off a cruise ship. Just be careful if visiting on Sunday - the interior is closed to visitors on Sunday mornings for services, and is also sometimes closed on Sunday afternoons due to weddings.",
          "It's beautiful and when you think cathedral you think quiet, solemn-not here, not when I went. Was so crowded and chaotic. They have midnight concerts and that is probably nice I was really regretting not having stopped by before to avoid the crowd.",
          "Stands out from the distance and thats about it, expensive to enter and fairly plain inside. A lot of hype, not justified.",
          "Original church building, especially seen from the outside. A pity they ask money to visit the inside while there is not much to see that differs from any other church",
          "I went as part of a group from the Hurtigruten to a midnight concert. The building was much smaller than memory served, but was as good for acoustics as claimed. (There were only three performers, but they filled the building.) Beatific use of concrete, if you can imagine it,",
          "Beautiful architecture. In summer you should join the summer concert starting at 11pm. After the concert, you can see the sun going down and rising up again.",
          "We went as part of a tour. I paid the extra (50 NOK or $6.20)to get pictures inside. The cathedral is small but the stained glass window is beautiful. Don\u2019t miss the elevated organ at the other end of the cathedral.",
          "Hiked here from the cruise port (30 minutes) while a gale blew, only to find it closed for baptism! However, could see the stained glass window from the outside and can only surmise that it is a huge cruise ship destination because it's the only thing to see in this one horse",
          "Don\u2019t be fooled this is not an historic piece of architecture and history. Good views of the bridge and town. Inside is bland and the stained glass window saves it. Small hill to climb up and some stairs so if you have some mobility issues take care and check in advance. Our",
          "The church stands out as you view the town. The stained glass and architecture make it interesting to photo. l visited in the summer, but photos of the church with the Northern Lights are spectacular. I would definitely take the opportunity to visit If you are lucky enough to be",
          "This cathedral has interesting architecture and beautiful stained glass. If you aren\u2019t going to a concert or event, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to walk through and see everything there is to see. There is an admission fee.",
          "From our cruise ship we could see the Arctic Cathedral, architecture stunning on our trip up close just amazing. You must pay to enter 50 NOK per person I understand why BUT to pay to enter a house of God leaves me cold so I did not enter.",
          "This church, nicknamed \u201cIshavskatedralen\u201d (\"The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea\") is an amazing church. Despite the name cathedral, the church is a parish church and not, in fact, a cathedral as it is commonly called. A glass mosaic was added later, it was a wall on the place before.",
          "A small church with an interesting design. But not lots to see. Walk in, look around, look at the stained glass. That's about it. Nothing, frankly, to go out of your way for.",
          "If you arrive in Tromso via cruise ship, you'll easily recognize this prominent place of worship as it will stand out in your view of Tromso Sound. While viewing the outside of the Cathedral will give you a sense of the unique architecture, make sure you go inside to fully",
          "We were awed by the wonderful stain glass the architecture is incredible and the guide explained why it was designed with 11 arches to represent the disciples excluding Judas. It is quite expensive to go in but then everything in Norway costs more that in many more southerly",
          "We attended one of the midnight sun concerts. You can buy tickets there or online. The concert is about 30 minutes long and is wonderful. To get there from Tromso, we walked across the bridge (about a 15 minute walk with great views), but we saw buses going over there as well.",
          "Awed by the beauty and peace of the Arctic Cathedral! The architecture is fabulous and such a testament in connecting the area and religion.",
          "The church was nice, but I think the price is overrated to go inside. Churches are a place of worship and should be free of charge",
          "The Arctic Cathedral can be seen across the water from the main city area of Tromso. It is a beautiful building . A walk across the Tromso Bridge will take you to the Arctic Cathedral .",
          "Absolutely not to be missed. Quite expensive for 30mins but typical Norway and no regrets. The music was so beautiful. Enchanting.",
          "We went to a mid night concert in June so we were able to see the place in daylight. It has the appearance of several lumps of concrete propped against each other. That said it has produced excellent accoustics.",
          "If you do not have time to explore inside, take a good look from outside. The architecture is beautiful.",
          "It\u2019s expensive (50NOK per person) to visit a church and see a very nice stained glass window - A big part of which is covered by the white backdrop of the alter. The architecture is impressive but can be appreciated from outside. The staff refused to allow someone to use the",
          "Stopped briefly at the cathedral for photos. Neat architectural design. Could not go inside the see the stained glass windows because of a funeral in process.",
          "From a purely aesthetic perspective, this Parish Church displays interesting modern architecture from the outside and a beautiful mosaic stain glass appreciated inside, but not much more to take away beyond that as a visiting tourist. A little less that a mile walk from the",
          "The cathedral itself is very interesting but it's good to go there before or after mass cos then you can see locals in their typical clothing. Quite interesting",
          "We first viewed the cathedral from the dock side and wow what a sight it has truly been built to leave you in awe We walked from the dockside across the amazing bridge which is worth the walk on its own, then on to the cathedral. I was disappointed that you had to pay to go in",
          "Everyone who will visit Tromso must came to see this amazing building what is close to bridge. I like modern churches what this Arctic Catedral is.",
          "We dropped by as it was on our list of 'must do's' and certainly the modern decor and the light and airy feel is in contrast to many cathedrals. The stained glass windows behind the altar is stunning, but it is sad that the whole is no longer displayed as it is covered by a",
          "Highly recommend, Very peaceful place and you will get a perfect shot of the city from there. be mindful not to disturb anyone in our instance there was a funeral procession going on so we waited till everyone left.",
          "This iconic church can be seen as you approach by ship or car. Designed by Jan Inge Hovig and built in the mid-60s, it is an incredible amalgamation of iceberg, church and mountain. The 4m wide concrete panels were cast in place on site. This is a masterpiece, an example of",
          "Interesting structure and is beautiful in the snow, you can see the stained glass through the windows out front, I didn't think it was worth paying to go inside. The views from the out front are great.",
          "Stunning modern architecture with light streaming through the stained glass and great acoustics making a superb venue for the midnight concert",
          "We visited here during the daylight hours then returned for a Midnight Concert . It is a lovely place quite unique in appearance and pleasing to look at both outside and in . The concert was wonderful even if I couldn't understand the words , it was so calm and restful ,",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is unique and cool to see if you are interested in architecture. You can see inside through the windows, and the inside is not very impressive. Wouldn't be worth the entrance fee.",
          "We attended the Midnight concert at the cathedral as part of our Hurtigruten cruise, it was such an amazing experience. the cathedral itself is stunning to look at both during the day and the night. sailing into Tromso it stands out magnificently against the mountain backdrop.",
          "As with most Protestant cathedrals/ churches, the interior is quite plain. The highlight is the stained glass window at the East / Altar side by Victor Sparre. Please check up the internet for details on the window.",
          "If you are religious this may appeal. The design of the building is interesting but when you get there you have to pay to go in. Taking a look through the windows the architecture itself is the interesting feature and this can be seen from a distance. The cathedral is 5-10",
          "It is a really nice building from outside, looks really nice as it is in the hills. we did not go inside as it was a little expenseive for such a small building. we did take a look inside, its like a regular church /cathedral. Must have been beautiful from inside as well.",
          "First of all, I don't know why people complaining about the 50 NOK fee. People would probably spend much more than that to come to Tromso or Norway and it costs almost cheaper than a cup of cappuccino. The fee is probably needed to maintain the amazing building and ground.",
          "We visited here whilst in town on a cruise ship in March. It is situated at the end of the Tromso Bridge and is an easy walk from the main city centre of Tromso. If your ship docks in town, it is perfect. If it docks out of town, you will have to get yourself into the main",
          "Well worth the walk across the bridge in Tromso as its so iconic a really outstanding feathure of the landscape",
          "We visited as part of a trip from our cruise ship. A very modern style triangular church with beautiful stained glass windows. The architecture symbolises the packed ice. The acoustics are said to be very good for the recitals held there.",
          "Very original church. I would recommended it because it\u2019s beautiful and you can see Troms\u00f8 from the other side of the bridge. Recomendable when walking to the Cable Car. The negative side: it costs 50 NOK, which I think is expensive.",
          "We went in a group from our cruise ship to an evening concert which was memorable. Great acoustics and musicians/singer.",
          "Well worth a visit. The cathedral is a simple but effective design but will not take long to see the inside. You may just wish to see the outside as this is the best view and to go in will cost you 50 NOK.",
          "I had long wished to see this icon of the Norwegian arctic and was not disappointed. We visited the Tourist Information Office close to the quay in Troms\u00f8 to buy bus tickets and get directions. Everyone speaks perfect English in Norway so independent travel is very easy. I think",
          "In many other places this would be a church rather than a cathedral, but from the outside it is spectacular and fits right in with the weather and scenery. So spend the 50 krona and go in. It is very nice and the stained glass window is spectacular. I imagine a concert would be",
          "Great landmark of tromso... Must go and check it out... Also if you are lucky enough you might even be able yo experience a concert in it... It claims yo have excellent accoustics.",
          "The exterior speaks for itself, but it is basically a church. As for interior, I skipped it as I am in disagreement one needs to pay to enter a place of religion. You can pretty much see everything from the outside by looking through the glass anyway. It wouldn't have been worth",
          "We went to the midnight concert in the Artic Cathedral from the southbound Hurtigruten boat. The hotel was great when we saw it in the daylight a couple of years ago, but by night with all the candles burning, it was magical. We were treated to some beautiful music by three",
          "We took a stroll around the city and headed to the Arctic Cathedral from the tourist centre. It was a neat building and at the entrance you have a good vantage point to the city scape of Tromso. Recommend to walk there.",
          "A truly amazing piece of architecture. Blends in so well with the arctic landscape. Nice shop to purchase cards and stamps. Lots of space to sit. Would recommend.",
          "The build g is stunning from th eoutside and I side. The stained glass windw and lights were really lovely . Wish there\u2019d been a concert !",
          "Gorgeous building.. looked amazing covered in snow. Its a definent for any visitor to tromso area.. great to stop by on wya to cable car",
          "Must see in Tromso but don't expect a lot. Definitely looks better from distance than close up. Average.",
          "I really enjoyed spending a little time here. It was peaceful and very pretty. You do pay a small fee to enter, so bring money. If you like to light a candle while at church, you will have the opportunity. I was there at nighttime. If I went again I would go a little before",
          "A modern church which gives access to a beautiful glass window and interior. Views across the bridge to Troms\u00f8. Admission fee \u00a35pp but you can take photos inside.",
          "First, I have to mention that the admission fee (at the time, 50 NOK) to the Arctic Cathedral is worth it. Compared to previous cathedrals I've visited over Europe and their architecture - its simplicity and symbolism was breathtaking!",
          "Lovely place to visit. Please check for opening times because they are a bit hit and miss. The northern light show in the celler is ok bit of a laugh.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral in Troms\u00f8 is a beautiful place to visit and photograph, both from the inside as well as from afar (from the Island side).",
          "We went to the midnight concert off a Hurtigruten ship and were very impressed with the architecture. Over the bridge but a must see if you are there",
          "Don't be deceived, it is not a cathedral but a church. It is small, but beautiful, and well worth the admission fee especially if you can get to see it with good sunlight lighting up the amazing glass pane window.",
          "This is worth the visit to see the building and the scenic views around it. It is a popular tourist site and not always open due to services. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "The church is located right off the Troms\u00f8 bridge about a 20 minute walk from downtown. It is a cold walk over the bridge but other than that it is not bad. The church itself is beautiful with Scandinavian architecture and interiors. Worth the visit. Charge is 50k pp",
          "Went to the cathedral but was closed. Got a inner view through the windows on front and on the side. Different and eye catching. In winters, on a sunny day walk to it.",
          "Can be seen from the docks when you are looking for the cable car. So modern and with easy access on the bus route, well worth a visit",
          "A fantastic concert. Definitely not to be missed when in Tromso. Magnificent, modern setting for the performance in the Arctic Cathedral, with beautiful acoustics. Superb performances by saxophonist, soloist and piano/organ.",
          "Visited this cathedral twice and the best time to see it is in the morning sun. When the sun shines through, it completely opens up to show the stunning design.",
          "Nice to take pictures and beautiful inside, but it's very small and has a fee just to walk in. I'd definitely recommend a visit though.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit.it is an excellent cathederal to visit different to what u imagine it to be.",
          "You have to take a bus or cab over the bridge (in winter) but it is definitely worth it. From the church you can get excellent shots of the city of Tromso!",
          "Went to the midnight concert at the cathedral organised by the cruise line and it was terrific. The acoustics were great and the selection of Norwegian songs and music were lovely. Even though it is cold and late it was great.",
          "This is actually a Methodist/Lutheran church but seems to be a general facility available to all faiths. It is a unique design and very impressive inside. It is used for some 500 concerts a year, more that one a day presumably because the acoustics are very good. A very popular",
          "An interesting modern cathedral, the walk across the bridge is very good and it is worth a quick stop to look at the cathedral but the best things in Tromso are natural not man made",
          "The cathedral consists of a simple sanctuary. There is no much history and there are no exhibits and commentary. The visit can be done in 5 minutes. Though the entrance fee is cheap compared to tge cost of anything else in Norway, the quality of experience is not worth commuting",
          "Apparently inspired by ice and snow the Cathedral sits above the port and fjord. Visited it in the early evening and it stood as a beacon of light amidst the February snow. Had the joy of attending a concert there by three musicians, entertaining with Norwegian themed music.",
          "I visited this site on a sunny but very cold morning; a very pleasant walk from the city centre (harbour). The cathedral is as impressive inside as it is on the outside: inside very tasteful decorations among which beautiful stained glass windows. Not to be missed if in Tromso!",
          "Beautiful and worth the visit if it\u2019s on the way but is it worth the price, I don\u2019t reckon. Staff wasn\u2019t friendly or helpful either. Went 5pm 4th March 2018.",
          "If you are passing through Tromso on a Hurtigruten trip, one of the planned excursions is to a Midnight Concert. This is a great experience and the quality of the performance of a mixture of Classical music and Local Folk music was magical.",
          "It's good for a short visit and I really liked the beautiful stained glass. Very easily to be reached by bus 20, 24,26 and 28.",
          "We attended a beautiful concert here . A soprano , piano, cellist and the church organ. It was an hour long and a ticket was required. It was a perfect thing to do at night with an easy bus ride across the bridge. Before entering the Cathedral we spotted a niceAurora to the",
          "For me, the arctic cathedral is really nothing special. It is a nice photomotive, when u take one from the other side of the Bridge, but if you stand in front of it or if u go inside, it is not more than a normal church. I went there for the Northern Lights Concert and was quite",
          "Worth seeing if passing by but wouldn't go out of my way to visit. Its just a modern large place of worship. No character to speak off. Wouldn't go again if in Tromso.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is a Tromso landmark & possibly the first venue that tourists visit. For a 50K fee it is worth a look. The interior is sleek modern & v peaceful with a beautiful stained glass window. My only reason for 3* is it doesn\u2019t take very long to see. 15 minutes &",
          "The cathedral is a real place of peace and calm. The place is alive in the sun. Recommend a visit, better still when you walk across the bridge.",
          "This is a must if you are in Tromso. White as snow, wonderfully illuminated by the sun or by spotlights in the evening. As bonus we had a concert of classic music inside the cathedral.",
          "We only got to visit the place during night time but it was still beautiful. TIP: Plan your day so that you can visit the Cathedral around 11am when there is daylight, because the light comes through the glass and looks magnificent. Then quicky after that, take the cable car up",
          "An excellent example of modern Scandinavian architecture. Winter concerts are organized late in the evening!",
          "We visited the cathedral after walking over the fantastic road bridge on our way to the cable car. If you like modern interesting construction, slabs of concrete making the triangle with glass infills at the joins. Very airy, bright and beautiful at night.",
          "We visited this church while we were at Tromso last week. It was such a beautiful place. While the church itself is not grand in comparison to more traditional churches in Europe, it is very unique with a good location from where you can see the city of Tromso. We stayed at",
          "On tours of Tromso we visited the Arctic Cathedral during the day and also at night for a midnight concert. The triangular church structure was build in 1965 on a commanding hill location. The architect wanted to suggest an arctic landscape. Originally the the glass behind the",
          "We attended the \u201cNorthern Lights Concert\u201d that is offered four nights/week at 11 PM. It was a magical experience. The acoustics of the cathedral are extraordinary and the three musicians are skilled enough to be booked anywhere in the world. The programme itself was",
          "This was on the way from our hotel to the cable car. I had read that it is compared with Sydney Opera house. However, have not visited that so cannot comment, but it is beautiful. Do not pass it, go inside and view. It is also very eye catching when illuminated at night.",
          "We visited this afternoon being in time for the advertised singing concert, paid admission for 50 Krona each and were then advised the concert was only scheduled at 2300 tonight. we feel the entrance fee excessive for <10minutes visit. The Cathedral is impressive inside and out",
          "Spectacular from a distance - less so close up. If you go to the ski lift then make sure to have a quick look here, but a quick look is all you really need.",
          "Beautiful church with great stained glass. Take the walk over the bridge - it\u2019s worth it at least one way if you can. It about 15-20 minutes over bridge",
          "The Artic Cathedral which is at the end of the bridge is on the way to the cable car so you can do both. I walked across the bridge from Tromso City Center which is an easy 20 minute walk but you can drive there or take a bus. There is a small charge to get in, 50 NOK/$6.36. On",
          "When you visit Troms\u00f8, you also visit the cathedral. It was beautiful to see but I think I expected more.",
          "ok for a trip if you have nothing else to do! in the evening the lights shine through the coloured glass windows. inside- nothing to write home about. music was ok. a bit souless",
          "Looks beautiful at night, lit up against the mountains. You can\u2019t help but see it. During the day it can still be seen. The stained glass windows are beautiful. Very much an active place of worship. For me it\u2019s beauty comes alive at night.",
          "My wife and I attended the northern lights concert as a light bit of evening entertainment with the faint hope that we might actually see the aurora if we got away feom the lights of Tromso proper. We were a little confused about which bus to take and if we needed cash for them,",
          "Stunning architecture and amazing acoustics! Went to a Northern Lights concert, half an hour, at 11pm. Well worth it, the sound was beautiful and just as I went in the Aurora appeared and danced around the skies. Magical.",
          "sorry, i really don\"t know what`s special about this church .history? design? art? nothing. it`s better for watch outside or just pass if u don`t have time.",
          "Small Church attract my eyes. White Triangle Church with snow white back ground so beautiful. see the town from other side of river.",
          "Looks really impressive on the outside. On the inside it is nothing special, really. It is ok to completely miss the inside and just take some photos outside and keep going.",
          "We visited the cathedral at midnight for a concert as part of our Hurtigruten cruise. The cost is high, as one comes to expect in Norway (and Hurtigruten) but the concert was wonderful and the setting really amazing. Inside, the cathedral is quite subdued, with mostly white",
          "The Arctic Cathedral was truly disappointing - it might look a bit special by its looks but its also very selecting as they dont let people in. They didn't open before 1 pm and on top of this they charge 50 NOK to enter. That must be a joke!",
          "It is a magical place. I loved it. The arquitecture is very modern. The sight of the cathedral is beautiful Anyway we decided ro visit and pay the fee but one on my sons decided not to go in the temple The lady in charge of the tickets asked him to leave the entrance hall and",
          "Fantastic building from the outside , looks very scenic from the harbour , illuminated at night . Great shaped building , interesting stained glass window , but the inside is very bare ! A nice little shop , to by postcards etc and some lovely pictures of the northern lights .",
          "Well it\u2019s a nice place but you don\u2019t lose a lot if you don\u2019t visit it. But it\u2019s free for take pics \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
          "After a walk from the Polar Museum over the big bridge (aprox 30min) we arrived at the Cathedral ( entrance 50NOK = 5\u20ac) Inside simple but worth the entrance fee and a nice place to warm up a little bit in the wintertime.",
          "You should just take a look at this place from the outside, there is absolutely nothing to see once you get in.",
          "We were in Tromso for the holidays and attended the New Year's Eve concert at the Arctic Cathedral. It was a very nice concert with something for everyone.",
          "We visited in the daylight to see the huge and stunning stained glass and then returned in the evening for the Northern Lights concert. A wonderful 30 minutes of haunting, uplifting and beautiful music.",
          "In my pre-trip research of Tromso I'd seen so many pictures of this church that I was intrigued to see it for real.  I will admit to just peering in through the doors and not actually entering as was more interested in the exterior architecture which is definately unique.",
          "We went over to the Arctic Cathedral for their Northern Lights concert at 11PM. Charming and lovely. Three very good musicians, a soprano, a flautist who also plays the \"yolk,\" (like a tiny piccolo,) and a man who played the piano and organ. The music was about 35 minutes of",
          "It was a pity that it was not open in the morning when we went after walking 30' from our hotel. It should be very nice to see the glass behind from the inside",
          "Anyone visiting Tromso must go to the Cathedral, although it is possibly the smallest cathedral I have been to. Easy access over the bridge and can be included during a visit to the cable car.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral boasts Europe\u2019s second largest mosaic glass window. If you are in the mood for some walking, you could walk across the Tromso Bridge and reach your destination. It costs 50 NOK to enter. You could take a seat at the back of the cathedral and watch the",
          "There is nothing interesting inside the building. So no need to pay money. You can take a photo from outside, because the image of the cathedral/ the view is very nice, also taking photo is free !",

          "We went to a magical concert at midnight on our Hurtigruten coastal voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes and back. It began with a soprano singing from the balcony in front of the organ behind us - a haunting solo. It was followed by a series of pieces with the singer accompanied by",
          "I was really impressed by the structure of this cathedral, so different from the traditional structures we\u2019re used to seeing for religious institutions. Just walk around and observe, sit in silence, or pray. Ask the person at the counter for the book with details about the",

          "From across the bridge, this cathedral is instantly noticeable cause of it's shape and size in relation to its surrounding buildings. It looks amazing from far just like it does close up! Definitely worth a visit!",
          "The world most northern-most cathedral. The architecture is beautiful, which inspired by the sami culture, externally and internally. There's a bus stop right outside the cathedral if you wish to get there. Otherwise, if you fancy a walk, going across the bridge would bring you",
          "We attended a midnight concert at this church. While the view is beautiful and church is pretty, the acoustics is amazing! It made the concert experience worth every minute.",
          "This really stands out in the Tromso skyline. Amazing from any angle and the triangular stained glass window is amazing.",
          "It is the bigest landmark of the city - you must see it. It looks nice but we did not feel needs to go inside.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is in an imposing position, of interesting design. We were disappointed at the charge of 50 Kn to enter. Written up in brochures as spectacular we found the interior to be simple and charming. It\u2019s a lovely place to sit quietly and contemplate or pray but",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is inland just next to the long bridge. It is a modern cathedral and it\u2019s architecture is characteristic. Try to go when de Nordlysfestivalen happend in late january.",
          "It is the landmark of Tromso, a master piece by architect Jan Inge Hoving , inaugurated 1965. The shape and color give associations to an iceberg. The glass mosaic is just magnificent. A place you must visit.",
          "Walked over the bridge to see the artic catherdal. Unusal building. Nice view accross the water to the city. Looks great at night also. Couldnt get to see inside as there was a funeral going on.",

          "This is a lovely building with clean lines, beautiful crystal chandeliers and a magnificent stained glass wiondow. However, the stained glass doesn't show up well inside when its dark out. It does show up outside when the lights are on inside but its difficult to make out the",

          "The modern architectural highlight of Tromsoe. Modern, austere, clear lines. Great stain glass windows )but these are difficult to see during the polar night...). A great organ inside, Definitely wirth a visit - you pay an entrance fee just like in Trondheim's cathedrale.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit. The stainglass window, the crystal lights and the organ are all wonderful. The outside of the building is also very impressive.",
          "Attended the Midnight Sun Concert. Just beatiful and the sun rays entering the Church, even at midnight is very special.",
          "What a stunning building. Our trip took us here in the dark. And it really makes an impression when you approach it. Lit up as a fantastic piece of architecture And the dark gives you the opportunity to admire the main window",
          "Beautiful cathedral but the only unfortunate thing was the church was closed. This would have been excellent as i walked so far and would not go inside",

          "As many others have put the architecture outside is the best feature, inside is as you would expect the workings of a cathedral and very simplistic so unless there is a concert on or you want to visit for religious reasons then not worth the 50NOK entrance fee. Beautifully",
          "We attended a Sunday morning service here in January. Lovely to hear the hymns (especially away in a manger ) in Norwegian. We were very lucky when we went as there were 4 infants being baptised and some of the girls in the congregation were dressed in traditional national",
          "Walked over the bridge to the cathedral - what a great view but watch the winds. The cathedral stained glass was lovely but can be admired from outside rather than inside but for 50k it was nice to get out of the cold",
          "The best view of the Arctic Cathedral is from the waterfront in the city center at night, not from inside the church. Don't bother with the easy but very expensive bus ride and the admission charge unless you are seeing a concert or want to go to a service. The pipe organ is",
          "Personally would skip the 50 krone entrance and enjoy it from the outside. The stained glass is far more attractive from outside and there is nothing much to see inside. Best if there is a concert or coincides with an organ recital, otherwise not worth a fee.",
          "Lovely church that we visited on Christmas Eve. We were graciously allowed to sit in on the Christmas Eve service. Afterward we walked around to see the inside and outside of the church. It makes for stunning pictures at dusk/night with the inside lights.",

          "Very plain on the inside but a fine looking building on the outside. Distinctive. If you don't want to walk over the bridge - you can catch buses from the centre of Tromso (No 20)",
          "Definitely worth a walk over the bridge to see, also lovely views back over the bridge to Troms\u00f8 island",
          "We walked across the bridge from Tromso, unfortunately we couldn't go inside as there was a funeral in progress. We took some great photos of Tromso from that side, would definitely recommend a visit, very different architecture.",
          "Spectacular setting for the midnight concert in which, among other exquisite pieces, Grieg was featured at length. Highly worth a visit due to its unique architecture.",
          "The outside looks very nice and different. Inside, after you paid your entrance fee it's a little boring....",
          "We walked from our hotel to the cable car and back. The Arctic Cathedral looks impressive from across the river but on our return journey seeing the stained glass window all lit up in the twilight - wow!",
          "We walked over the bridge from which there are great views on the way. The Arctic Cathedral is a spectacular building that is lit up at night and is a real feature of Tromso. We didn't go inside.but recommend walking to the rear of the building to appreciate the stained glass",
          "was here again after 2014 and we had tickets for a midnight concert. THe artists were a female singer, a pianist and a female flute player. The program were nothern norwegian songs and some old traditional songs fro mthe Samen. Very interesting performance, some songs were",
          "This is a stunning building but I would save your money and not bother going in. In my opinion the most beautiful part of the building is the stained glass window, visible from behind. There are a few stunning chandeliers inside but for me otherwise it was unremarkable (if you",
          "We walked across the bridge during the polar nights and saw the cathedral on our way to the cable car. The architecture is beautiful, particularly when illuminated at night. I highly recommend checking out the exterior. We didn't go inside as it didn't seem worth the cost and",
          "We walked over the bridge twice in order to see the Cathedral during the day and at night. It looks wonderful lit up and made for some really nice photographs!",
          "I was a bit dissapointed. I thought I could expect more but when we arrived there was actually nothing special. If you are in Tromso and you are not able to go to the cathedral you are not gonna miss anything.",
          "The walk from centre city cooler than the church. Just go. You\u2019ll see everything you need to see in 10 minutes.",
          "Ok, so I'm not dissing this wonderful building, but rather like Sydney Opera House it's better viewed from the Mossman ferry than close up. When seen against the backdrop of the mountains it is lovely, but having slogged across the bridge in a blizzard, it was utterly",
          "We visited this lovely cathedral on a two day stay in Tromso. The outside is the most impressive part and it is worth walking around the back to view the stained glass from outside - particularly in the dark. The building is sleek and not like other cathedrals although I think",
          "The Ishavskatedralen is Troms\u00f8\u2018s landmark and well worth the walk across the bridge. The view of the city and the fjord is great from the bridge and the cathedral. We did it during polar night darkness and I can recommend it. The illumination is beautiful and the look is iconic.",
          "Ishavskatedralen (The Arctic Cathedral) is supposedly the northernmost church in the world. The building itself is very unique, with great views overlooking downtown Tromso. Do check the opening hours before visiting to avoid disappointment not being able to enter the building.",
          "worth the visit if only for the exterior - funeral in progress when we visited - stained glass is stunning by night",
          "We joined the Christmas Service on Dec. 24th. It was in Norwegian language, but that didn't bother us at all.",
          "After enjoying views from the top of the cable car, we traipsed through the snow to have a look at the cathedral only to find it was closed. A group of school kids charged past us in the hope of visiting it as well, so not sure who knows when to visit. But as the buses stop",
          "The building is impressive from the outside and looks beautiful both by day & by night (lit up) The structure replicates jagged icebergs,striking white with glass accents Can be seen from across the bridge and is worth the bridge walk (weather permitting) Entry fee of 50 NOK",
          "Artic Cathedral is unique in terms of its architecture. Different! Impresive! You ca go to Midnight Sun concerts!!",
          "We\u2019d read about Tromso\u2019s impressive and iconic Ishavskatedralen (it\u2019s a church not a cathedral apparently) so decided to walk there from the Fjellheisen cable car (about 10 minutes away through a pleasant suburb). Opened in 1965, it consists of 11 steeply angled aluminium coated",
          "The cathedral was closed but we could see through the windows. It is empty beside bench... Nothing really interesting, worth to go just to take pictures.",
          "Nice to see when it's night at the outside. Inside (entrance NOK 50) not so spectacular. Maybe in summer when the sun shines.",
          "Beautiful! What more can I add! A stunning addition to our trip to Tromso and even more magical on New Years Eve. We were even lucky enough to have a Northern Lights display on our departure from the concert! Wow! Beautiful building, clean and well organised. Staff friendly and",
          "You can take either bus 20, 24 or 26 to get there. Usually takes about 30-40 minutes to walk around, make some pictures, enjoy the view and go back to bus stop, that way, the ticket you purchased to go to the church will be still valid to return or continue you way. This time of",
          "Unexpected that admission was charged. Could be walked to from city center but take wind into account as crossing the bridge could be challenging when it is cold. Beautiful inside and worth a visit but is just as beautiful from the outside or lit up at night.",
          "You can see the church from the other side of the bridge and it is an impressive design. Worth a walk over the bridge to see it.",
          "Great atmosphere , with the sun sinking then rising again, as we were there in June during the midnight sun season. Seemed odd for it to be getting brighter again after the concert. There were 3 musicians, just a short concert, but definitely worth going",
          "Interesting building from outside. Not so much inside. Worth the bridge walk if not too windy otherwise take the (very expensive) bus. Close to the cable car .. both nice if sunny and not too windy.",
          "We walked here from tromso city center which was a pleasant walk across the bridge. It's a very unique church but cooler to photograph from a far. Can get good views of Tromso Island.",
          "We\u2019ve been to Tromso twice, but this was our first visit inside the Cathedral. We were lucky enough to attend a midnight concert in the Cathedral this Christmas while on our Hurtigruten cruise and it was simple but stunning and the acoustics were brilliant. While it\u2019s \ud83d\udcaffrom",
          "The Hurtigruten ship stops on the Northern sailing during the day. Time to enjoy Tromso be daylight. The Cathedral is beautiful architecture replicating jagged icebergs -- striking white with the stained glass colored accent. Great views of Tromso as it sits high on a hill. On",
          "We attended the annual Christmas concert. It was lovely evening filled with wonderful Christmas hymns and music. We took a bus there, and it was easy and quick. We walked back to our hotel, a lovely and scenic walk over the bridge.",
          "We hiked across the river bridge to the building from the harbour. It may be more impressive in the winter than summer since it is all lit against the dark sky. From what we could see inside is spartan and functional. Its the exterieur that's so remarkable. Lovely stained glass",
          "I was told this was closed today , however expecting to arrive to talk some external pictures I was not surprised as it was Sunday to find the doors open and the church full to capacity - the music and the crowds were amazing and it added to a wonderful Christmas Eve.",
          "Outside is a beautiful structure and a great view of Troms\u00f8. We paid 50 kroner per person to go inside. It was worth the small price. A band was practicing and we got to hear them. The inside is beautiful. Parking is easy. They have a lot next to the building and just across",
          "We were there this December and the cathedral is made out of iron and steel recovered from a sunk German war ship ! It\u2019s a piece of history worth visiting",
          "Caught the local bus - make sure you have a prepaid travel card - as it is quite a walk from Tromso town across the bridge. Cathedral is beautiful but only requires a short visit to see everything. We walked on and caught the ski lift which gave beautiful views.",
          "The Arctic cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Tromso. The church looks great from outside and the best views are at night when the lights are on. It costs NOK 50 per person to get inside the church, however there is nothing inside to view so don\u2019t waste your money,",
          "We could see the cathedral light up from our hotel (Clarion With - stay there; it\u2019s great) and wanted to see it close up. It is beautiful - wonderful use of glass and light. The downside ? It was closed to visitors, even though it was the middle of the day and there were",
          "This Cathedral I think is last and biggest towards the Artic circle. Its stained glass and chandeliers are just fantastic. A must visit when in Tromso.",
          "A good piece of art is timeless. This is exactly what the Norwegian architect, Jan Inge Hovig, did for Arctic Cathedral. It reminded me of Frank Lloyd Wright's design for the Guggenheim museum in NYC. It is such a pity that this Cathedral had erratic opening times and charges",
          "A very modern lutheran church built in the 70ies. From an architecture point of view it's quite a thinking to design and build a structure in that fashion. You can catch a buss right from the centrum to this place, or you can walk which probably take about 25 minutes from the",
          "The highlight of Troms\u00f8, and possibly the most beautiful building in the entire North of Norway. Best viewed fromt the outside in winter, and best viewed from the inside in summer, so you'll have to visit twice. The building itself is the real star here, look at how the cross is",
          "We visited the Cathedral based on good reviews about it. As I expected, the building was very nice and modern; I really appreciated the design. Since we couldn't go inside because of the Christmas Concert, I highly recommend checking opening hours before coming here.",
          "We only got to view from the outside as we arrived around noon. I nice spot for some pictures though. You need to walk under the bridge to get round to the front of the building. We would have liked to have a cuppa and a cake in the area but could not find anywhere to do this.",
          "If you are on one of the Hurtigruten cruises and you are thinking twice about booking the Midnight concert at the Artic Cathedral, don't because it interrupts your nights sleep. Catch up on your sleep later and go. It is absolutely magnificent church and a magnificent concert.",
          "when you happened to be in Tromso , it is a must to visit.you will see a very nice view of the island and the sea . A must!!!",
          "This is definitely worth a visit for the window. To see the lovely colours and design you have to walk outside around the back of the cathedral. The inside is very plain.",
          "We went on a very snowy day but still enjoyed the lovely cathedral. Don't miss the stained glass window in the back. One thing to note is that it does not open until late in the day so we got there after 12:30 and it was not open yet. We still took some beautiful pictures. We",

          "The outside of the building can be seen all round and looks fab , so thinking the inside would be better we paid \u00a35 to go in .. no atmosphere no information no anything totally waste of money if you want to see it look in the window . The slope down it\u2019s not for the faint heated",

          "Very nice place to stop by during the dark winter nights. In contrast to other Lutherian churches in Norway, this one is open for tourists. The entrance fee is 50 NOK. Also check the back side with its colourful mosaic.",
          "The view from outside of the Cathedral is very pretty, overlooking the city. Its 50Nok to go inside the Cathedral, which was quite pricey. Was bit disappointed inside, expected more.",

          "Top music .lucky setting with lots of snow  outside",
          "Beautiful architecture, I just had to go and see it. It took me about 15 minutes to walk over the bridge from the center of Tromso to get there. The exhaust from the cars while crossing the bridge was terrible. Good thing I don't have any \u2026",

          "Lovely and unusual from the outside. Not worth paying to go inside- not much to see",
          "This building is very iconic from outside, and it is really simple inside. It is nice to see and located in a great place, with nice views over Troms\u00f8. Worth the visit for the views, maybe not for the building itself",

          "Best in night fall or sunset. Exteriores view is best. Do walk around the whole building. Pay NOK to enter.",

          "Nice cathedral, good modern architecture of the outside part, but to enter it is necessary to pay 50 kr (5 \u20ac) only to see something that you can easily see from the windows in the front. I do not think it is worth it.",
          "Interesting architecture/shape on the outside, perhaps good to take some pictures. Costs 50 NOK to get inside, which IMO is odd for a place of worship, seemed commercial...even a brochure costs 30 NOK. The woman at the counter was very rude \u2026",

          "In my view a really interesting piece of modern church architecture dating from the 60s when Troms\u00f8 saw a big expansion. It\u2019s one of the landmarks of Troms\u00f8 and can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. It\u2019s a little way out of the centre but easily accessible by many buses and is en route to the cable car.",

          "Lovely building, looks beautiful when lit ip at night",
          "Looks wonderful from afar, looks fine when standing outside. That's it. Charging money to go inside this church is outrageous. Churches in Norway is funded by the state, and should not charge admission.",

          "Best to go here on the way to Fjellheisen as it is on the same bus route. It is also possible to walk from the city centre, but it will take around 20+ minutes and the wind can be quite strong while crossing the bridge. Need to pay if you want to go inside the cathedral itself.",
          "Nice place, nice architecture but over all is just a church. But people who are into that kind of places might love it.",

An eyecatch from the everywhere on the Troms\u00f8 island and it's easy to access. The walk across the bridge is cold and if it's windy you have to protect your face otherwise you'll freeze.",
          "Peaceful place.",
          "Very nice church. Worth a visit.",
          "Unique design. Brings a lot of sunshine inside the cathedral. You need to pay entrance fees which is not very expensive. All in all 30 mins peaceful time with god.",

          "Great experience ! You can be surprised when you look at the exterior view because it\u2019s an atypical cathedral but when you go inside it\u2019s even more suprising ! The cathedral glass are truly beautiful. It cost 5 Nok to go inside (around 5.30 \u2026",
          "Nice building but overpromoted in my opinion.",

          "A must see, as it is one of the most famous (if not the most famous) landmarks in Tromso. However the entrance price of 200KN (\u00a320) for 4 people, is certainly not worth it, as the church is not much bigger than an average community church in England and of course it has no history as it was only built in 1965",

          "Go in get a ticket from the machine. Very informative and helpful. We got bus tickets waited 5/10 minutes, I imagine other times may be busier but worth the savings on bus tickets. You pay more on the bus if you pay in cash",

          "This is the busiest tourist office I ever saw in my life. U even have to take a queue number! Plan your trip using the internet ahead of time and avoid this tourist office as much as possible ! U don't want to spend your precious holiday time queueing !!",
          "Such a busy place! The staff are helpful and knowledgeable but there are only three desks and the place was full of people at 9.30am, all waiting to be booked into tours. Apparently they are moving into bigger premises and hopefully will get through the waiting tourists a bit",
          "we already booked all the evening and night activities before the trip but a few days were open for daytime activities. so we saw the tourist information that was conveniently located, we asked their help to find and book some day trips. it was crowded but shortly we had an",

          "Me and my friend came to the office because we wanted to book a whale watching excursion. Since there are so many agencies offering trips online, we decided to ask at the Tourist Office (which after our visit, I am not so sure it is). After a short wait we were greeted by",

THE day we were suppose to go on the safari and waited right in front of the dock and waiting, nobody showed up. We kept",
          "Really weird we can not find any reference to the fantastic cable car trip to the most wonderful outlook point in Tromso. Is this politics?",
          "The tourist information place is a great place to get information and book tours. Depending on the person serving you, you may get great tips from them. As we stay at tromso for 6 days, we visited the place a number of times. We met some nice and warm people that gives useful",

          "I went there to inquire about city bus tickets especially for the number 42 bus to the airport and I was able to purchase the ticket there; very convenient. The two English speaking young men were very helpful. They also sell maps, books and other tourist items.",
          "The staff is helpful. They will give you all the info and activities that you can do. They can tell you the best place for have a beer and also the place that you can enjoy tipical food. They close on Sundays.. So maybe you will need to ask a map of the city in a hotel near.",
          "The staff at the desk is quite friendly but the senior simply just wants the tourist to shut up, do some self-teaching and only speak for tours. Come on, it is an information centre, not a ticket shop!",
          "We decided to stop here first to better understand our options of things to do in Tromso. I found that the person behind the counter wasn't really volunteering ideas and you kind of needed to let her know what you wanted to do and she would book tours for us. It seemed more of a",
          "The people working there know the area and can be a great help at deciding what to do during your stay in Troms\u00f8. They are friendly and answer any kind of questions. They also sell post cards and other souvenirs and you can book activities on the spot.",

          "We found it incredibly difficult to get information out of a very unenthused worker there. He seemed almost annoyed that we had questions on what to do and where to go in Tromso. Poor service and disappointing given the array of tourist options in the area",

          "We found the people at the tourist office very helpful. We were in Tromso in September to see the Northern Lights (see my separate review on Kjetil Skogli - he's excellent) and wanted to do a short fjord trip. They suggested the normal passenger ferry that did a 2 hour trip -",
          "Very helpful lady on desk gave us some excellent advice on using the very frequent bus service. This saved us money and allowed us to see more of Tromso.",

          "Visited the tourist information several time during our one week stay. Got an excellent service each time by the friendly and helpful staff.",
          "Easy to find near dock where Hurtigruten ship arrives. Very busy place both times we went there, but well worth the wait because staff were so helpful. Unbeknownst to us the weekend we were there was the The Arctic Race. The bus routes were changed and many roads were closed.",

          "We had pre -booked a tour with Karl Ivor tours (see review) but forgot the paper with the time to meet. Our meeting point was the Tromso Tourist Center. We picked up our number and waited to be called. Lots of pamphlets to read while waiting. The wonderful young man at the desk",
          "Asked for parking recommendations ... They could have said take bus 5mins out of town and park free. Only recommendation was tunnel under town. Should.have taken taxi from airport.rather than rental car if not also going other places...",
          "The CENTRE was extremly helpful in providing maps and other information needed during our day in Tromso.We found the centres helpful during all our stops in Western Norway. It was a surprise to find that a large number of the inhabitants were not Norwegian but found work because",

          "We were there to buy the tickets for the concert in the cathedral and get some advice on what to visit the day after by car. Really helpful!",
          "Right in the centre, well organised. You take a ticket (like at the butchers!) and wait when they're really busy. The staff could not be more knowledgeable, friendly or helpful. The shop is stocked with nice gifty things. Go in! You'll be delighted.",
          "we used the info center several times, bought tickets there, and got maps and suggestions. They were helpful every tie.",
          "Long waiting time. Pull a number and wait. Good service but you can actually arrange everything directly with providers over the internet. They also sell some souvenirs and books, but you can also buy that elsewhere.",

          "Check before traveling to Tromso as I arrived over the Easter time and nothing was open, not even the Tourist Information Center. However the Info Centre did open on the Saturday for the day and they were able to provide a lot of info re open times and tours etc but the only",

          "When planning our visit to Tromso we contacted the Information Center for advice and the answers they provided were of great help. Naturally I had to visit the Center in person. Thank goodness I got there between tourist ships so my wait to be served was not too long. They do",
          "If you want to know what to do, how to do it, how much it cost, or buy the ticket, this is the place. The staff was beyond my expectations!",
          "They gave us good information, we booked an Aurora trip and they even gave us a bustrip with timetabled.",
          "I wrote to the tourist office prior to my visit regarding fjord tours and received excellent guidance. I also walked over to the office while I was in Tromso to get restaurant advice, and again, it was extremely useful. The one quibble is the waiting period can be long.... but",

          "I agree that the people working here are knowledgable and pleasant, HOWEVER, be prepared to wait a looooong time. The actual building, inside, is rather small for the amount of people going through here. There are displays of souvenirs right in the center of the room, with",
          "Be prepared to wait a long time for service here but it is well worth it. Our advisor was excellent. Extremely knowledgable about Troms\u00f8 and the activities on offer. Definitely recommend to call here to get a good overview of who is available. They also advised of upcoming",
          "Alright,.. the laidies at the counter are very knowledgeable, personable & they offer lots of helpful information. But we went to the office 3 times and on each one we had to wait more than 30 minutes! Once we had to wait more than 1 hour such as the place got so crowded.",

          "Always a good idea to start with a visit to the tourist information centre when arriving in a town you do not know. You have to make reservations for tours and excursions and also for the busses of Tromso (cheaper then when buying on the busy). Be aware it gets crowdy sometimes",

          "The tourist information centre is a great place to book any activities & excursions and several of them use this location as a pick up point. The only issue we had was that the wait time was huge. We wanted to book a northern lights trip and we queued for 50 minutes to be served.",
          "This place is really useful but make sure you allow time ! When we went you had to take a ticket and wait for your appointment as it was so busy booking trips for people .",
          "Just call in as a point of interest at the beginning of your trip here. We were told all trips booked up by Hurtigruten. Here they found us a booking and we were on the same trip as our fellow travellers so don't despair if told no more room!",
          "The Tourist Information is a great start for your Tromso excursions. There is a lot of information available and the staff is very friendly and helpful. However, try to avoid the peak hours, i.e. mornings, as the office fills up easily. Typically you have to pick a number and",

          "This is a great place to book your northern lights excursions, to request a map and for general information. The only problem can be the waiting time during the high season to be attended. But staff is very nice and helpfull.",

          "Very helpful staff. They even printed my tour vouchers for free. All of them speaks perfect English! Very helpful!",
          "On our first day in tromso there was almost a 2 hour wait to be served. We took a number to wait in line, went shopping and came back after. The guy we eventually were served by was not friendly and not very helpful. We were pretty disappointed. I would do your research online",

          "Very helpful and VERY busy. If you need to come here try and avoid the afternoons. In the morning most people are off on their tours so that's the best time to visit, otherwise you could be waiting for 45 minutes",
          "Very very busy they certainly need more staff as the waiting time can be upwards of one hour or more but the information is well worth the wait",
          "Very busy!! Worth waiting to speak to the friendly informative staff. Lots of information leaflets available.",
          "The staff are lovely and helpful but maybe a little too helpful; there was only 2 on duty with about 20 people waiting and they spent the best part of an hour serving one customer. Its a shame, they were great but the system needs sorting out;",
          "Perfect place to start in Troms\u00f8, walk in, take a ticket and then chat to one of the advisors who can tell you everything you need to know about the city, surrounding areas and attractions available. You can also buy souvenirs and book activities here.",
          "Can't comment on service as gave up waiting. Very small with minimal seating and only two staff on duty. Shame as it really is inadequate and gives a poor impression of attitude to tourists.",
          "A nice cosy atmosphere - but it gets very busy. Take a ticket from the machine when you enter. Very helpful staff.",
          "Very friendly they help you find best suited activities for your stay Go early in the morning or during lynch time as there are a lit of people going for infos.",
          "They were very helpful but it can get very busy so leave yourself plenty of time. Purchase your bus tickets from here rather than on the bus as it's cheaper.",

          "great source of info, but the building is small, and cannot really cope well with loads of tourists turning up at the same time download the app and make bookings via it - its a lot less hassle",
          "I booked 3 tours with the Tromso Tourist Board. One of them was a whale watching tour on Saturday 11 February. I had picked a particular tour but we were told that it was either full or not running - I can't remember which. We went out on the tour which was great - beautiful",

          "The staff was very helpful, sorting out everything we needed quickly. However it was VERY busy every time we went there. We spent more than one hour waiting n the queue.",
          "The place is great for information , maps and making reservations but there are just to many people and to little staff to help them. You are better of making reservations online and get your additional information , such as maps , at the tourist information center.",
          "Super helpful! Emailed and got a quick response and also showed up for help once in Tromso as one of our trips was cancelled. They were very helpful in getting us where we needed to be!",
          "Maybe we arrived at the wrong time but the four girls behind the desks were working their socks off and still the ticket holding tourists were waiting ages for information. A lot of info available but also free WiFi which meant people crowding into the building just to pick up",
          "We bought bus tickets here for the local bus back to the airport. This option is much better value than the flybussen (which we took when we arrived as it was better with our large baggage). Buying tickets from the helpful, English-speaking staff was very easy and they directed",
          "The staff at the Tromso Tourist Office really helped us to get the best out of our short visit to the city.",
          "I really felt for the staff in the tourist office - the place was heaving all day, every day. People don't seem to be prepared to do any research themselves, relying on the staff to organize their trip - many would be at the counter for 30-40 minutes, thumbing through brochures",
          "Helped us a lot. But there were a lot of people, so expect some waiting. But the staff was very helpful and pleasant.",
          "Information Center is situated near the water front & can be reached quite easily from centre of town. Most/ all the locals know about this place & would be happy to guide you. We were about to start our light hunting expedition & had a few hours to kill, so we decided to plan",
          "This is a very busy office. We took a number but couldn't get served even after waiting over 30 minutes. Perhaps they could consider giving people approximate waiting times.",
          "You pick up a ticket when you come in to join the queue. On Friday 3rd Feb I waited a whole hour to be seen, however anyone could see that the delay was caused by the staff being super friendly and helpful to their customers.",
          "Today I was there wanting to buys something from the souvenir shop. I waited about 30 minutes and no one was at the counter for me to pay. It is quite disappointing how they only have one single toilet for both men and women waiting for toilet. This is a hard place to get",
          "The staff there was informative and patient with all sort of questions. It was situated near the harbour where most of the cruises come in and close to many hotels and the city centre.",
          "My wife and I visited at a particularly busy time when a ship had just docked but even so were seen within 10 minutes. We booked 2 return bus tickets to take us to the cable car for magnificent views of Tromso and surrounds. We were given directions to the bus stop and advise on",
          "Although desk staff were very helpful, the waiting queue should be better managed. We queued for over an hour and then booked a tour in ten minutes!",

          "We went here twice and the guy who helped us was great had everything we needed well worth using. Just a word of advice if you take the round trip on the bus and boat which is booked at the local bus station you need ID and no one told us could have been a disaster",
          "The ladies here were both knowledgeable and very helpful. You may have a wait as they'll take their time to make sure you're well cared for and with that others seek their assistance Thanks to them I got the cheap bus option to allow me to explore the island.",

          "We visited tourist information centre three times during our weeks stay in Tromso. We only had to wait once. If there is a big queue then I suggest you have a walk around and come back a bit later. The staff there are very helpful and give you lots of their time. They will",

          "We were there in the peak tourist season in February. We were stuck in the queue for almost 2 hours. The staff take really long time for each customer and there were only 2/3 counters. I think it should be better managed based on the number of tourists that arrive in Tromso. I",
          "Went in a couple of times - both times waiting an hour to speak to someone - they should have a 15 minute slot timescale and if you need more time then get back in the Q. Once we got to speak to someone they were very helpful and booked us some trips - we had already booked",
          "They are attentive to our requests, very efficient and friendly. We asked them some advices for dog sledding and they were able to advise us correctly and meet our expectations. Go ahead as soon as you arrive in Tromso and ask them what you want or simply take some leaflets and",
          "We booked 3 tours but had 2 days to find activities to do. While we waited for 30-35 minutes, the service attendants are incredibly knowledgeable, honest and attentive. We ended up selecting another norther lights, reindeer and fjord cruise. Only criticism is some tourists spent",
          "I should start the review with the fact that I was here over Easter when lots of things were closed and schedules were not normal; however, we went into the tourist office twice to try and get information and left with answers that were still very much up in the air - for",
          "The tourist office is first class, the staff are extremely knowledgeable and are very helpful. The queues can get quite long, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. It is worth it though",
          "This is the only option that tourists have for booking excursions as hotel staff simply cannot be bothered to book anything on your behalf. This means that you have to queue for 40+ minutes just to be seen by a member of the tourist office and they will only book you on tours",

          "We asked for advice on how to choose an aurora tour, how to switch buses to get to Ersfjordboth and how to get to the airport early in the morning. Sometimes you have to wait a little bit longer but it pays off. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful. The price for souvenirs is",
          "We actually went in just to look for some souvenirs. There is a good choice. However when we went to pay, we queued for 30 minutes. The queues were not big and there was a few attendants working. Im sure the people that were booking activities and trips found it very helpful."

        "wiki": "The Arctic-Alpine Botanic Garden (Arktisk alpin Botanisk hage) is the world's northernmost botanic garden. It is located in Troms\u00f8, Norway, and is run by the Troms\u00f8 University Museum. It opened in 1994, and is open from late May to early October. The garden displays Arctic and alpine plants from all over the northern hemisphere. Entrance is free of charge.The garden is located to the southeast of the University of Troms\u00f8 Campus, commanding a view of the mountains to the east and south. The location, corresponding to the north coast of Alaska, invites thought of an extreme Arctic climate. However, a branch of the Gulf Stream sweeping up the coast of North Norway provides a moderating influence, and the climate of Troms\u00f8 is one of relatively mild winters (January average \u22124.4 \u00b0C (24.1 \u00b0F)) and cool summers (July average 11.7 \u00b0C (53.1 \u00b0F)).From May 15 until July 27, the sun is continuously above the horizon in Troms\u00f8. The two months of midnight sun provide some compensation to the plants for the short growing season and the low temperatures. In the months of May, June and July the theoretically possible number of hours of sunshine is 623, 720 and 695, respectively. The average hours of actual sunshine is about 200 for each of these months. From November 21 until January 17 the sun never rises. Snow generally covers the ground from October or November on, and will accumulate until the beginning of April. Snow then gradually melts and the ground will usually be bare around mid May at sea level, while lingering on far into the summer at higher altitudes. The season in the Botanic Garden is usually from end of May until mid October.Special Collections:\nRhododendron (e.g. R. Lapponicum), Meconopsis, Aster, Polemonium, Erigeron, Codonopsis, Rose Cultivars, Allium, Saxifraga, Silene, Tellima, Heu\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhomepage in English\nHumanflowerproject: About Troms\u00f8 arctic alpine garden",

The lake sits at the highest point on the central part of the island of Troms\u00f8ya inside the city of Troms\u00f8. Prestvannet was built up as a reservoir in 1867, and continued in that function until 1921. Since then it has been used as park land and a nature reserve.\nThe pond area, just next to a big city has been preserved as a nesting place for various birds. The pond and its surrounding wooded area is an important natural area for the Troms\u00f8 area. Encircling the pond, is a track commonly used for recreational activities and sports, as well as a nature trail with plaques informing about the local wildlife. In the winter, the frozen pond is a popular place for ice skating.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I had a lovely bracing walk up to the lake and when I arrived, it was covered in snow. The only way you could tell it was a lake because there were lifesavers in places around. I also found the Tromso Geophysical Observatory which had a screen showing auroral activity.",
          "It was snowing...so we were unable to see birds and the lake was frozen but the place is really nice, you can walk along the lake safely there are lights to show you the way and the place is beautiful at night with snow flakes everywhere",
          "This is a perfect hour-or-so walk from Tromso. Absolutely beautiful (frozen when we were there) lake with great views of the mountains too.",
          "We visited on our honeymoon as a recommended place to view the northern lights.. The first night was cloudy but still really cool there.. The lake was frozen and the path around very snowy with people skiing.. The last night before we left we returned and spent five hours",
          "I had the good fortune to walk there straight after a night of heavy snowfall. Really beautiful. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "The tourist information center gave me a tourist map and said it\u2019s a thirty minute walk with signs. I saw only two signs. I suggest using Google maps to catch all of the turns. It took me about 50 minutes to walk there because I have hip trouble and am over age 60. The lake is",
          "Nature at glimpse. The walkway around lake is easy. Fine way if you want to avoid steep paths. One hour is more than enough.",
          "The lake was frozen solid and covered with snow but it still looked beautiful. very easy walk from town centre. cannot wait to return in the summer",
          "Good place to spend time and relax. If you are a skiing enthusiast then this is the place to be. You will love it for sure:)",
          "Only about 15 min walk from the central city and an excellent spot to watch the Northern light- and its free :-)",
          "We walked here from our Airbnb in the snow, absolutely lovely place - we did a circuit and enjoyed watching the locals cross-country skiing.",
          "Walked up one evening from city centre. Very uphill walk so a bit tiring but good views of the city on the way up. It's difficult to 'rate' a lake out of 5!! It was as expected, a beautiful expanse of snow surrounded by trees. I can imagine it is lovely if you can spot the",
          "We went here to see a sunset. Well, ok, it is not possible to see a complete sunset because of these trees around the lake and the mountains in the distance but we decided to go to the center of the lake and it was amazing experience. Since the water was frozen and it was cold",
          "A beautiful lake on the mountains in the city, nice ways for hiking and skiing, directly at the Lysl\u00f8ypa, great for watching the aurora!",
          "Whilst up on the mountain behind the cable car I'd seen this patch of white in the middle of the city and figured it must be a park. So the following day we went off on a hunt to find it. Even though we had a map, we made a few wrong turns before finding signage that helped",
          "It's about half an hour uphill to reach the lake from the city center. Around the lake is a 1,7km walkway, with skiing tracks as well. It was really nice to get away from the city a bit and enjoy the scenery.",

          "I went there for a walk with my husband, sister and child aged 9. We didn't take the bus and it was a good choice because we could look at the landscape and the child (and the mum) could slide up and down the hills covered by snow. We had great fun, the lake was frozen and we",
          "Went there for a walk just before taking our plane. One hour of a magical walk. During that time of the year, you can walk on the frozen lake. The landscapes are just gorgeous!",
          "Great place to observe Northern Lights in winter only half an hour walking from the city center. Went there in the evening of December 26 and observed vivid northern lights in the sky. Good alternative to expensive (and also wonderful) tours hunting for the northern lights.",
          "Great place for hiking or running, or bird-watching in the summer. In the winter, you can see the aurora and sometimes ice skating or skiing. Great for outdoor-lovers",
          "This lake is on the middle of the Troms\u00f8 island, and the lake, and surrounding area is peaceful, and really nice. The hike around the lake is about 1.7 km, making it perfect for a little walk with kids, that you can combine with feeding the birds during the summer season, but",
          "On the recommendations of several people in town, we walked up to the lake one night to try to catch a glimpse of the northern lights. It's a wide open area that is somewhat away from the city lights, providing a nice view of the night sky. Although we had a clear night, there",
          "We walked from the main town up to this lake through much settled snow in December. Whilst the walk was quite a distance, it was stunning. It meant we walked past areas of town we might have missed, and really got to see the Nordic architecture of residential houses (teemed",
          "One of my favorite place in Troms\u00f8. This is also a great spot to see the aurora borealis at night. Prestvannet is also very nice during summer time. The place is so picturesque.",
          "I spent a night here for the northern light (but in vain) and the next day I came here again during the day. It is very beautiful that the lake was surrounded by the mountains and trees. I sat here just enjoying the view and silence for hours.",
          "In this area, it is a short ride by local bus from the city center for a great view of possibly seeing the Northern Lights on a clear night. It can be very cold below freezing with the wind blowing. I had to wear a double down jacket, two sets of thermal underwear, bring feet",

          "My wife and I took a romantic evening stroll to the frozen lake after dinner one evening in the snow. The lake is in the north of the island from the centre which is relatively elevated from sea level and therefore quite a tough walk if you're not used to hill walking. The",
          "Great footpath up rom the centre and round the frozen lake around a couple of hours there and back from the centre in heavy snow",
          "In summer nights, birds go crazy because of the lights and their noise is deafening. This is a great spot for bird watching and to see the norther lights in winter.",
          "We took bus number 40 from Tromso city centre up to Prestvannet Lake . The cost of the bus was NOK50 each so fairly expensive, however once there, there are plenty of trails and walks to enjoy. There are cross country ski tracks that are lit in winter and many locals seems to",
          "We walked up to the lake from the centre of town - approx 20 minutes. It is all uphill but easily accessible. You will definitely warm yourself up if you walk there! The views of the frozen lake and mountains in the background were beautiful so definitely worth the trip.",
          "A lovely place to see the Aurora from - if you're lucky. If not, it's a really nice walk - wrap up warm! Easy to walk to from the city centre - or on a regular bus route.",
          "We visited this lake in Januari around noon and the view was just amazing. The path is very accessible, even during winter. If you're looking for a hike that is easy to manage, not too far from the centre and accessible for all ages: go for it!",
          "We were told that this is a great place to see the Northern Lights. But the path around the lake was completely frozen, so it was very difficult to walk. Plus, we did not find too many places to sit and did not see the lights.",
          "We walked to Prestvannet from Telegrafbukta beach along the really well marked, accessible trail. Beautiful views of the surrounding mountains along the way and lots of places to stop with a flask and enjoy the outdoors. A must do free activity in Tromso.",
          "Lovely location, great for jogging or walking. Panoramic views of the surrounding area very popular with skaters and families on the frozen lake. On the occasions the aurora is visible in Tromso itself then this is an ideal spot to get up high and away from the city lights.",
          "A popular lake among locals and tourist alike. Jogging here was a great experience. Once you are done, do not forget to feed the ducks.",
          "This is a nice little lake on top of Troms\u00f8. It's also often lots of birds around the lake. And many track to go and get away from the city center and it's cars. Tho' you can never escape the airplanes that are over you almost all the time.",
          "Been here many times. I just can't get enough of it. Prestvannet is a great place to relax, jogging around the lake or picnic. On a winter, Prestvannet is a great spot to watch the Aurora Borealis.",
          "Prestvannet is a small beautiful lake in the middle of Troms\u00f8ya. In summertime it is full of birds. There is a really nice, around 2 km-long walking route around the lake.",
          "We went there during the day for a walk and decided to come back in the evening. We were so lucky as Aurora showed her beautiful green face in full blast! Amazing experience.",
          "I only discovered this after years of living here, embarrassingly. It's a beautiful little lake with a great path all around it - it is 2-3 km to walk the entire path. I sometimes bike it. On a sunny day, I highly recommend this. Lots of local birds. You can see distant",
          "Well worth a trip up the hill to Prestvannet, especially when there is a lot of snow. Enjoyed the views and the walk along the ridge on the ski path, then back into town. Wonderful views.",
          "We did a bit of research prior to our trip and went up to the lake on our first night due to the clear sky. The climb took around 20 mins from Tromso, primarily due to the frozen ground - not a difficult walk, just a bit slippery as we had not used our spikes yet. The lake area",
          "This area is used year round by locals, but it sorely needs an upgrade. The whole area around the Lake is overgrown and run down.",
          "We visited the lake to see the views, it was frozen when we visited and was being used by families for cross country skiing, linked with jogging, hiking and skiing tracks to both ends of the island it was busy on the bright Sunday we visited"

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Finnish: Tromssa; Kven: Tromssa; Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a city in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  The city is the administrative centre of the municipality as well as the administrative centre of Troms county.  The Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland and its Bishop are based at the Troms\u00f8 Cathedral in the city.  The city is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya which sits in the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait, just off the mainland of Northern Norway.  The mainland suburb of Tromsdalen is connected to the city centre on Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel.  The suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya is connected to the city centre by the Sandnessund Bridge.\n\nThe 21.25-square-kilometre (5,250-acre) town has a population (2017) of 64,448 which gives the town a population density of 3,033 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,860/sq mi).  The city centre (on Troms\u00f8ya) has a population of 38,980.  The mainland borough of the city, Tromsdalen, has a population of 16,787 and the suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya has a population of 8,681. The most populous town north of Troms\u00f8 in Norway is Alta, with a population of 15,094 (2017), making Troms\u00f8 a very large city for this vast rural northern part of Norway.   It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). \nThe city's largest workplaces are the University of Troms\u00f8 (UiT) and University Hospital of North Norway. The Norwegian Polar Institute also has its headquarters in Troms\u00f8. The Northern Lights Observatory was established in 1928, and two companies affiliated with the Kongsberg Gruppen collect satellite data from space using the observatory. The fishing industry is very important. Norway's Norges R\u00e5fisklag and Norges sj\u00f8matr\u00e5d (seafood council) both have their headquarters in Troms\u00f8. Sparebanken Nord-Norge also has its headquarters in the city. Furthermore, \"Skatt nord\", an agency of the Norwegian Tax Administration is based here too.\nThe city is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from the word for \"island\" (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The Polar Museum is a thought provoking place to visit. I recommend combining it with a visit to Polaria, to get a balanced view of the Norwegian attitude to the Arctic. The Polar Museum details mainly the activities of various people who hunted, trapped, killed and skinned",
          "It\u2019s a cute museum that gives context to the area of Norway. If you don\u2019t know who Roald Amundsen is, you should look him up before going to Norway as he\u2019s a maritime legend and he launched his last expedition from Tromso.",
          "Terrific way to spend an hour or two. My husband enjoyed the history of the early expeditions and I was riveted by photos and personal stories from those who overwintered.",
          "Very interesting museum on the Arctic explorers and inhabitants. It is definitely worth a visit. Free wi-fi inside if you want to check for further info during your visit.",
          "The polar museum is very interesting to learn about how people use to live, the big bussines hunting bacame to the area. And about the research of the North Pole, not an easy task. If you like history is a must.",
          "Not grand, not dominating. But so well set up and so interesting, at least for people interested in polar travel and in Norwegian nation building.",
          "It's a nice little museum with a good exhibition about hunting in Scandinavia. If you have enough time, check it out.",
          "A short walk from the Hurtigruten Terminal, the museum provided a great opportunity to shelter from the inclement weather. The museum is bigger than it looks and has rooms devoted to hunting whales, seals and polar bears. There is also an extensive exhibition on Roald",
          "Great museum that is bigger than it looks. It has a booklet which describes all the exhibits in English and covers lots of different parts of life in the Polar regions. I would recommend looking around this museum, especially if it\u2019s snowing outside as it\u2019s a great way to warm",
          "A great insight into polar exploration and the history of this region. Allow at least 1.5hrs and there is a lot to see and interact with. Some good English translated exhibits but an English guide book is available for you to use from reception for free, just return it at the",
          "Not sure what to expect when we went to this museum to get out of the rain, but it was so interesting to learn about Norway's role in polar exploration and tales of survival. Great hands-on exhibits. Would definitely recommend.",
          "The Polarmuseet or Polar museum displays parts of the polar history of Troms\u00f8 ranging from the history of whaling, polar bear hunting and seal hunting, but also explorers such als Amundsen that tried to reach the North Pole. Some of the displays looks fairly modern, others",
          "If you have time it is worth to visit the Polarmuseum in Troms\u00f8. For us it was very interesting to learn about the expeditions.",
          "Amazing details in the museum, the artifacts are all in set in a building that could have been built hundreds od years ago, really took you back",
          "Amazing Museum, verry intresting show\u2019s you how life was in the artic. Sometimes surprising and somerimes confronting. Absolute must when you have a half a day.",
          "Very interesting museum showcasing how it was the life in the Arctic in the early times. It is perfect enough to spend an hour during your stay in Tromso. Entrance is not that expensive as well - costs around 7 Euros. Although I am an animal lover it is a bit depressing to learn",
          "... exposition of whale and seal hunting is not appropriate in times of mass species extinction ....",
          "My wife and I had a great time exploring the Polar Museum in Tromso. The museum is a combination of local history and polar history and has an interesting collection of realia and photographs. The museum is on several floors and is well organized. The accompanying explanations",
          "We visited this museum whilst on a stopover with the Hurtigruten cruise. It\u2019s about a 15-20 minute walk from the boat. It gives an interesting account of life in the Arctic, which was tough. So yes, there are some gory bits, but that\u2019s how it was! We were given a leaflet in",
          "Well worth an hour or twos visit while in Tromso. Some brilliant local history as well as polar history generally. I am always in awe of what these pioneers did with the resources they had at the time and this museum provides some real insight into their strength, resilience and",
          "OK to visit if nothing else to do. 1 to 3 hrs max enough. A historical and educational experience. 70 kroner per pax.",
          "This is a little museum, but very informative. Before you enter they give you a pamphlet in English that explains the different displays. To be honest, a lot of the pictures on display are pretty gory, especially for animal lovers. The museum showcases just how brutal life in",
          "A high-quality museum close to the city centre. Ticket price - NOK 70. All the explanations in the museum are in Norwegian, but you get a guide brochure in maybe more understandable language, even Russian. I would not recommend this museum for small children: seal hunting scenes",
          "We visited here today as a party of four. It\u2019s a smallish museum but has plenty of information about pre-historic life and also Arctic exploration - lots on Roald Amuldsen and the race to the poles, in particularly. Overall the museum is a little dated but it flows well enough.",
          "Good description of the polar expeditions. A little bit of everything: life, persons, history. Strongly recommended.",
          "I have nothing to add that other reviewers have not said. Their new location is great, and they do give a guidebook in English (and others as well) for non-native Norwegian speakers. Some exhibits have multiple languages and others do not, but the books are well-laid out.",
          "Inside a customs bonded warehouse from the 1830s, Polarmuseet does a tremendous job in presenting the history of the polar regions and how the Arctic has been explored and exploited for more than 500 years. It was opened on June 18, 1978, the 50th anniversary Roald Amundsen\u2019s",
          "This little museum had a lot of good information and some really interesting visuals. I really like museums so I enjoyed the 90 or so mins we spent there. Norway has an amazing history of polar exploration.",
          "An interesting little museum, and it gets you into the history of trades etc in Troms\u00f8 and surounding areas. The museum doesnt take long to visit, approx 2 hours as long as you dont fancy reading all the signs and text.",
          "If one is into the history of Norway and the surroundings is is a must see. What's that old saying? Don't judge a book by its cover\". This is one of those examples. The museum details the explorations of one of its famous sons, Admunson. Various rooms detail the various",
          "This place really is good value for money. It doesn't look big from the outside, but it certainly seems to be more than adequate for all the many and varied exhibits on the inside. Well worth going to find out about the exploration of the Arctic and the way of life of the",
          "Troms\u00f8 has a great history as a hub for Arctic and Polar (yes, South as well) exploration. This museum details out both research but also exploitation of the area and puts it in their historic context. It is an important museum. Troms\u00f8 is rich in culture and museums, if you have",
          "Lovely museum. They give you a fold up chair to carry with you if you have a cane and need to sit down! Tells a lot about the polar expeditions and people who settled in Tromso. Worth a visit.",
          "High international standard and very well told description of the old hunting, trekking and fishing in the Arctic and the Barents Sea, the explorers in the Arctic, the wildlife and the many challenges. Also, visit the book shop for interesting arctic literature. I've been here",
          "I visited with my father and son 18.07.2019. The exhibits were fairly standard but the story of Fridtjof Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen artic expedition was very interesting.",
          "All the family liked this museum, great place To visit with kids of any ages. I learned a lot and the children too.",
          "Not very elaborate, but a harsh reminder of the determination of the hunters and the odds they faced. Their imagination in killing knew no bounds and many ingenious ways were devices to handicap and kill different prey. You feel sorry for the lives they wantonly killed for",
          "Great overview of the polar region of Norway and all the hardships; the fishing, whaling and seal hunting industries; the explorers and vessels and realistic displays.",
          "An interesting museum that can provide you a bit of a crash course on famous Norwegian expoorers. They have translated booklets that serve as companions to the things you see in each room (there are some placards in English) but for the most part you need to match up what room",
          "After going to other lacklustre museums in Tromso, this one really stood out. The downstairs exhibitions were lacking somewhat, in both their organisation and the lack of English translations. However, the upstairs exhibition on Nansen's Polar Exhibition made up for this. The",
          "Great museum showing the Polar history. Plan to spend some time here. Showing the impressive history of the Norwegian explorers.",
          "If you're a details freak, you can spend here a whole day I'd say. There are guides on entry in different languages containing a lot of info and separated in sections marked with room numbers. May be difficult to go through if you've got a weak heart and opposed to animal",
          "If you are interested in the Polar histoty , this is a must . Very many fine stories and deatails from the many expeditions",
          "What a superb little museum in this great town. Fascinating info mainly about Nansen and Amundsen, 2 amazing men; one who led the way, with his 'invention' of skiing, (certainly popularising of it), and the other who conquered the NWpassage, South Pole and flights over North",
          "Very interesting displays of the life and travels of Roald Amundsen and Fridjof Nansen, the polar explorers who came from Tromso. Most descriptions naturally in Norwegian and some in English but did not detract from the interest. My knowledge of simple Danish did help.",
          "The Tromso Polar Museum is located in a building nearly 200 years old. Tromso is in the Arctic and a good base for expeditions to the North Pole. Local resident Roald Amundsen and his team were the first to reach the North Pole in 1926 and this expedition is the main subject of",
          "Upstairs in the museum is where the history buff's will get their fill. It's all about Arctic exploration, including the famous Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen, and his sailing of the North West Passage and leading the first expedition to the South Pole. Downstairs is more",
          "Inside this museum there is a lot of information about polar expeditions and how people lived here over the ages, in harsh conditions. Fishing and hunting were there means of survival. There also nice boat models and diorama's about daily life in this unforgiving climate. A",
          "Pretty well done. Learned about the polar explorers and whaling industry. Can get through it in an hour, or spend more time if the weather is bad.",
          "Quite an Interesting history, lots of reading. Most information in Norwegian. Not a very modern museum.",
          "From the outside this museum doesn\u2019t look much but don\u2019t be misled, it is brilliant. So informative. You will not be disappointed.",
          "Amazing museum with great history of the polar expeditions and polar activities from thousands of years ago too the most recent history. Student discount and the combo ticket with Troms\u00f8 University museum made this the best value for money museum visit I have done in Norway so",
          "Really interesting museum regarding Norway's history particularly regarding hunting. There are quite a few skins etc around but as this was part of their history I don't think it should be avoided for this! You get an English guide when you go in which is helpful. Great way to",
          "A good museum if you are interested in the history of Norway's Arctic exploits. Although the info around the museum is in Norwegian when you get your entrance ticket the booklet they hand out gives you most of the info in English. All in all a very interesting little museum.",
          "As others have said, this is an Interesting if a little quirky museum, there are some English language translations and we were provided with a well thumbed English language guide was handed out on entering. Clearly this museum is run on a shoe-string, but is non the worse for",
          "An interesting museum about the way of life here in the past. I learnt a lot about Amundsen and Nansen. Lots of stuffed animals and skins, but that is how it was! Worth a visit.",
          "Nice warm museum, not at all old style with good displays. Not good if you\u2019re at all squeamish or have strong anti-hunting views! Very informative about the history of the region and polar exploration. Displays mainly labelled in Norwegian but language translation guide",
          "Good displays. Shows how they lived by hunting and fishing. Shows exploration of Amundsen and Nansen with artifacts. Well worth it.",
          "An informative museum. Lots of stuffed artic animals and their skins here. Lots of information on the Arctic explorers too. My 8 year old loved it here. You would probably spend about and hour and a half here.",
          "Interesting if a little quirky museum, very little English language signage makes it hard to fully enjoy the experience. A grubby well thumbed English language guide was handed out on entering but was not of much use. That said the exhibits that did have English translation were",
          "Deceivingly small and dull from the outside, this Museum is a gem of displays and information about the historical Polar expeditions to the North Pole, legendary exploration heroes and how Tromso developed from a base forseal hunters. The English translation guidebooks were a",
          "Interesting hour looking at life in the Artic over the years. The first impression is that it was quite brutal with hunting quite central in the first few rooms",
          "Quaint and educational. Good historical background. Not high tech and I think for older children only. Helped us understand the context of Troms\u00f8",
          "Its a nice stop to see some history, the museu is relatively small, so it wont take much of the day, and add some knowledge to the trip.",
          "We could have skipped this museum and wouldn\u2019t have missed anything important. A rundown little place with a surly staff, it is full of dead stuffed animals and dioramas that depict (some in quite gruesome detail) the slaughter of seals, polar bears and other arctic wildlife. We",
          "Worth your time. Subtitled in English. Lots of fascinating artifacts and history. We really likes our trip here.",
          "Just ok if you have nothing to do in Tromso but still worth a visit. Its in the city center and nearby other attractions hence you can add this in your things or places to visit in Tromso",
          "an interesting visit to this museum which tells the story of expeditions and how the Norwegian and Arctic land and wildlife were explored and exploited over time.",
          "2nd time in Troms\u00f8 and in Polarmuseet. Nice piace to have a look at Svalbard\u2019s life during first expeditions and learn something about them. Highly recommended",
          "At first sight this museum appears a slightly ramshackle collection of stuff. But as you go through it, it is impossible not to become immersed in the fascinating stories it tells of Arctic (and Antarctic) exploration and the men an women involved.",
          "Superb museum to visit. While I was given a paper guide that was in English, most of the text around the museum was in Norwegian, which made some things pretty difficult to follow. That being said, the museum had plenty of pictures, artefacts and displays that kept me fully",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the hour or so we were in the museum and would advise anyone interested in the native Norwegian way of life years ago to as well as the history of Tromso to visit.. Yes it is all a bit cramped and yes it's a little amateur but on a cold winter's day it is",
          "Had a wander round, some interesting stuff, but nothing that wowed us. Very basic museum, with only some of the descriptions in English. Expensive for what it was",
          "A very interesting museum. I learned a lot about polar exploration and the main historical figures. Many pieces have an English translation and there is an English language guide book to explain exhibits. Liked this a lot! High quality exhibits",
          "It provides interesting information about the hunting culture int he area and expeditions to the North Pole. However, the place looks rather small and information in English is only provided in a leaflet, which is not easy to follow. It's a good place to spend your day if",
          "We had a few hours spare so went to this Museum. Very good, if you are into Artic History, reasonable price. Worth the visit Very near main town high street.",
          "Most of it is indeed about animal trapping and hunting, so some may find that upsetting (I am a serious animal lover myself), but on the other hand it is a strong part of Norwegian history and the driving force behind a lot of arctic exploration so you can't reasonably expect a",
          "So brutal! It's not a happy fun place for kids or anything, what with all the baby seal clubbing and polar bear suicide inventions, but it details the harsh reality of humans surviving in the arctic in the early days. Fascinating and gruesome, but expectedly so. There were too",
          "I usually like historic museums like this one, and I found it quite interesting, and it really gives the idea of how it was to travel in the arctic with the technology they had back then. I does not take too long to visit, and the price it totally worth it. We visited it when it",
          "About Svalbard only, lots of deceased animals. They gave a english BOOK to understand all of exposition, but there was no legend in english. It became too tired and boring.",
          "The museum is very informative on the local life during the early hunting and expedition days. A lot of original items of that time. A walk through brochure is available at the entrance in many languages. If you have time it is worth a visit.",
          "Incredible resources on polar explorers and life on Svalbard through the centuries. For me the museum is a must see. Located close to the harbour",
          "Small museum featuring historical photos, exhibited artefacts including trapping gear and the occasional stuffed seal that didn't look too happy! Worth a visit to appreciate the grim way many people used to make a living for themselves and their families.",
          "Nice museum where you can learn lots of things about artic exploration and the artic world. The building itself is also very interesting. Worth a visit to learn about this harsh environment and the people dealing with it",
          "There is some great history here of Polar exploration and hunting. This is not for the faint hearted as hunting for food and warmth is a fact of life here. the museum shows the success and failures of the early explorers",
          "This was a fine collection of polar exploration memorabilia housed in a lovely old wooden building. Worth seeing.",
          "We were only in Tromso for a couple of days and so shortlisted some possible places to visit, this museum being one of them. We arrived at the museum about 45 minutes before closing, however it was a small museum so we thought this would be enough time. We were out within 5",
          "This museum is small but has lots of in-depth information into hunting of seals, whales and polar bears. None of the displays are in English but you are given a leaflet with English explanations, it makes it quite hard to work everything out and I think it would definitely",
          "Cost nk70 and spent 1.5 hrs - it was interesting especially to see life when hunting was a way of life and hear about the arctic explorations.",
          "This museum isn\u2019t what I expected at all. It\u2019s primarily about expeditions to Svalbard and (over)hunting of various animals for financial gain - polar bears, foxes, seals, etc. They talk about the people who hunted, showed how they killed the animals, and provided stories around",
          "This museum takes in the history of whaling and sealing, if you don\u2019t want to see or read about that you will need to skip the first part. Overall it was ok, you had to read about everything in the booklet that you were given, which had to be returned at the end.",
          "Great for learning history of the region, it's small and compact but really informative. You are given a leaflet in your language to explain the exhibits, worth a visit!",
          "well worth a visit and you can really appreciate the work involved in this site. staff very knowledgible in the displays & excellent in answering questions.",
          "Very interesting place, although nearly all the exhibits were accompanied by Norweigan text. They gave us a little brochure on the way in with English explanations, but some of the items were numbered incorrectly which made it a bit difficult to find what some of the things",
          "Unless you like hunting but there\u2019s nothing impressive. No the facility, no the information. Still it give you an idea of the way they used to live in this area. Since everything is about hunting it\u2019s depressing if you\u2019re animal lover.",
          "Coming from England, a relatively temperature and forgiving country to live in, the way of life that the Polar Museum shows is almost beyond comprehension. The work these people had to do just to survive can be incredible. Their daily way of life is harder than most people can",
          "Really wasn't a fan of this museum. Really glorified the hunting and trapping history and there were better ways it could have been told. Very graphic displays involving stuffed dead animals. Made me feel physically ill.",
          "Closed for the week we were there, which is such a shame as we were really looking forward to seeing the exhibit. Tromso was full of tourists, so seemed an odd time to be closed",
          "Nice museum with many rooms on Arctic life and polar exploration. Free guide book in English so you\u2019re not totally confused by the Norwegian descriptions. Some stuff is a bit contrived and cheesy but the display on Amundsen is excellent.",
          "Nice place to visit in Troms\u00f8! Good and relaxing time spent here with friends and family. Profesional and nice staff!",
          "not to expensive. realy good for the money. lot to see and to read. nice to see everything. way better then polaria",
          "Had just re-opened.. Very well laid out and interesting exhibits throughout..Tough these Norwegians..! Would have like more English translations on the smaller exhibits..",
          "We were there with a tourguide so don\u2019t know the prices. I really liked the visual experience, not only text but a lot of stuff you can feel and are allowed to touch. One of the betrer museum-experiences!",
          "A good museum that looks at the polar history of Norway. My only issue was the booklet they provide is written in too small a writing for me to easily read It is not closed despite people saying it is, you need to visit the right museum towards the bridge",
          "Unbelievably shut in Sami week, although being advertised as having a Sami Display. Could be worth a visit but not knowing what is inside and when open.",
          "This site is still closed despite the website stating that they would be opening back up on January 6th. We tried to go on January 12th but it looks like they are closed until February",
          "There are many items used by the explorers of old times. It is nice and neat and definitely something to do while someone is in Troms\u00f8. I recommend it.",
          "Although we checked the website before walking there and it had open hours listed, when we arrived, it was under major renovation. See picture that was attached to back fence. It says reopen on January 6, 2019, but I would call first.",
          "A nice diversion if you have a free afternoon. And don\u2019t miss the sea otters training...they will melt your heart!",
          "I heard so much about this wonderful museum which is located facing the harbour. It is a red in colour. However, I was disappointed to find it closed for renovation.",
          "A lot to see. Great place to spend few hours with family. Is not many places in the world where can see a polar bears. Definitely worth it when in Tromso!",
          "We went because my mom and I are fascinated with all things about Antarctica and the Arctic. It\u2019s a small museum with a lot of information and exhibits. We really enjoyed visiting it.",
          "Very disappointed. Considering this is one of the main museums in Tromso there was no information on their website to say it\u2019s closed until 6 January. We had to find out from a notice placed on their door. This was one of the reasons we had come to Tromso.",
          "Nowhere on their website says that it is closed so walked there to find construction work on-going and signs to say shut until 6th January. Advance warning on their webpage would have been nice.",
          "This museum covered a lot of polar history ranging from famous explorers, tales of hardship and survival (or not), and as horrible as it sounds the barbarity of the old ways of living in the harsh polar region. It does not have some of the modern technology like audio",
          "A shame that it was closed for refurnishment. My review is low due to not finding out till we got there that it was closed. I hadn't seen anything online to say it was.",
          "This is a very town-specific museum that houses the early history of the Tromso area. It was built upon the fur, fishing, and whaling industries. Many of the original implements, tools, bones, pelts, stuffed animals, and pictures graphically depict how the animals were",
          "Told myself not to visit anymore museum but there is really nothing much else to do. It was raining, so went in and paid 60kr. Nothing much to describe except stuffs you will see in every museum except this one displays the local history.",
          "great museum with info about polar expeditions and various explorers! visitors were given a paper booklet in english which explains every room/exhibit. may be better if the booklet is laminated? it seems to be falling apart! haha but still very useful.",
          "The Polar Museum has an immense range and depth of material describing many aspects of Polar discovery, life and work. Presented very well. From the outside it looks like a small building but once inside it keeps expanding. We spent several hours, but it could have been more.",
          "Larger than I thought it would be, lots to read and interesting information on the polar explorations from Troms\u00f8. Filled in an hour on a rainy day.",
          "It looks small from the outside, however there is many information inside. The visit was included in the walking tour I did. I believe that is the best way to go in, understand and appreciate what is inside",
          "Nice small museum gets pretty in depth explaining things we did a fly by visit not getting deep into all the exhibits. Inexpensive. Well worth it.",
          "The Polar Museum is small but vert nicely put together. Anyone interested in the history of how harsh life was. Lots of displays of stuffed animals and old tools and artefacts, clothing, Entrance fee 50Nok, worth it in my opinion",
          "This museum is a small interesting place about the polar expeditions and the animals that were hunted in them. The information is very helpful to learn about this topic, but it was hard to realize that so many animals were slaughtered like that for survival of the human kind. It",
          "We chanced upon this museum and decided to go in. it is a very interesting and well laid out museum. A word of warning, it has some quite graphic displays dealing with the hunting of seals, bears etc. in the early days so if you are feint of heart it may not be the place for",
          "Our polar history displayed and explained in an interesting way. A lot of memorabilia and genuine things gave the place an atmosphere, which we all found good. A place where it's possible to spend quite some time.",
          "We spent about an hour here. It's a good museum with interesting info. We both felt it really enhanced our visit to the Fram Museum in Oslo later. The displays felt a bit tired. Not everything is in English, but it's enough. Really enjoyed the Roald Amundsen exhibits - what",
          "Unfortunately most of the displays have descriptions written only in norwegian but some also have English descriptions. Nonetheless it\u2019s interesting to look around. If you do the city walking tour it is included in that and you will have the tour guide to explain everything",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. Most of the exhibits are labelled in Norwegian (why wouldn\u2019t they be...), but when you arrive they give you a little booklet in your own language to explain what you\u2019re looking at. There are some really interesting facts,",
          "There wasn\u2019t much about this museum that wowed us. It\u2019s in need of exhibit updating: HOWEVER, everything is extremely interesting and they have guides in many languages if you cannot read the Norweigan descriptions. I definitely learned something! I give it a \u201cvery good\u201d score",
          "Lovely museum in Tromso where you will be able to learn a bit more about Amundsen's trip to the North Pole and Arctic life in general. Very interesting if you have a spare couple of hours while your stay in Tromso.",
          "My wife and I visited the Polar Museum in July. The museum is interesting, but most of the displays had writing that were in Norwegian. They do provide a free returnable English guide that does help. Parking is very difficult and expensive in downtown Tromso. We ended up",
          "Excellent and informative exhibition on the Norwegian explorers Roald Amundsen and Fritjof Nansen. Could do with a little more space since some of the exhibition (particularly on the upper floor) seems to be somewht crowded.",
          "I think this museum could be more interactive. You had to read a lot and there were a lot of animal skins and stuffed hunted animals. It made me a little uncomfortable to see all of it, frankly. I understand that was the polar trade at one time but I am quite happy the seals,",
          "Tromso in the past was important place as a starting point for all polar expeditions.Tromso Polar Museum is the place where the story of those chalenging adventures unraveled before you together with a history of this region of Norway.",

          "Small museum giving a lot of information on earlier hunting in the North Pole region on seals, polar bears etc as well as on explorations done by Willem Barentz and others. Takes an hour or two depending on how much you like to read. English tour booklet available.",
          "Small but fully packed and well done museum about life north of the artic circle. Manikins and stuffed animals looked lifelike and very real. Displays included boats that were outside on the docks with the old motors used to propel them. Inside all the displays were printed",
          "We visited this museum in the last few days, Weather outside was cool so we were rugged up. This museum is very warm inside so to enjoy make sure you wear layers. There are hooks to hang coats on when you arrive. Very interesting and quite a bit in English. They provide a",
          "Interesting museum about polar explorations. Not only Norwegian activity in the region is discussed, but also that of the Dutch, British and Russians. Pity that most of the displays are only in Norwegian. However, booklets with information about the displays are available in",
          "It is small, but every space is filled with fascinating details about exploration of the Arctic and the difficult life of men who earned their living in it by hunting seals and other animals. Original equipment with detailed explanations of their purpose and usage and full-scale",
          "I usually have cold feet when visiting museum. This place was really captivating. Beyond telling about history, you get a sense of the great people who led the big hunting, fishing and discovery expeditions. Great to do with kids.",
          "An excellent museum exhibition of polar life. The stories are well set out and have a lot of their explanations in English which is really helpful!",
          "It was really impressive to see everything related to the polar region's life in one exhibition. I know the trapping and sealing sections might be disturbing to some, but this was the way of life then and I found it very informative. There are some English signs and the guide",
          "The museum contains a lot of information about the history of exploring the artic, and many artifacts about Roald Amundsen's voyage through the Northwest Passage, finding magnetic north, and his journey aboard the Fram to the South Pole. Interesting little museum in a rather",
          "The Polar Museum tells the story of risky Arctic trapping and courageous polar expeditions, the building is from the 1830's. It is a few floors but can be accomplished in an hour. In all fairness, we were docked in Tromso for three days because of weather issues and had",
          "A place to get to know a lot about arctic researchers and discoverers you never knew set in an atmospheric place right at the edge of the water, worth a visit!",
          "The museum was better than expected. Take the time and visit while in Troms\u00f8. What an impressive story! Take the time and read the story either in the English booklet they provide or on the display.",
          "If you\u2019re even sort of Interested in polar exploration, this is the museum for you. Be sure to budget a couple of hours at least, because you\u2019ll want to see everything.",
          "We went to the Polar Museum in Tromso after exploring Tromso on a bus tour from the ship Silver Sea. This is a very small museum in an old container, extended. There were examples of the way of life of former trappers, examples of former types of traps used very cruelly to",
          "We had a tour around this small but history packed museum, every space used to full potential, exhibits are impressive and the knowledge that can be gained is huge if you already know what you are looking at, without the tour I would not have gained much from the displays,",
          "Probably an hour\u2019s worth of entertainment unless you a really into polar exploration. As a Brit, I liked the Norwegian bias regarding the race to the South Pole - entirely appropriate. We did it on a joint museum ticket deal. It filled in a spare couple of hours on a rainy",
          "It was free entrance when we got there! The museum is full of information about history of expeditions. Must see!",
          "Rather small museum but ideal to learn more about nordic expeditions and personal stories. Worth while to visit.",
          "Tiny, dilapidated, mostly in Norwegian (yes the museum is in Norway but 99% of tourists don't speak that language) museum which focuses on hunting even though it markets exploration.",
          "There\u2019s a lot packed into this modestly-sized former waterfront warehouse. We especially enjoyed the intriguing polar exploration exhibits we found on the upper floor \u2013 including attempts to reach the North Pole by air, the colorful life and polar (North Pole and South!)",

          "I would definitely stop at the Polar Museum. You can probably cover the entire museum in about 1 hour. Learned a great deal about the Norwegians part in polar exploration and about the industry in the polar regions. It would be a good place to take children.",
          "Polar museum has lots of intresting stories to tell about Nansen, Johanssen and Amudsen. All interesting exhipition items are on the top floor. The museum is not big so it was crowdy.",
          "I liked this little museum, which crams a lot of Arctic history into a relatively small space. I learned a lot about the history of Arctic exploration in general, but the most fascinating exhibits were the ones detailing the treks of Roald Amundsen (which I were familiar with)",
          "I'm a museum junkie and went here on my first day in Tromso. It packs a lot of detail of the history in northern Norway and polar exploration. I went through it twice because it was so interesting and I wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything. An excellent place to visit to",
          "Very well done with history carefully documented but it\u2019s depressing. All that killing of those poor defenceless animals. It appears the greedy Norwegians of old had no heart. If you\u2019re a vegetarian, animal lover or someone of high sensibilities I wouldn\u2019t go. It made me feel",
          "On recommendation from a friend we went upstairs in the polar museum to make the best use of our time. The polar explorers exhibit was well worth our visit!! So glad we went.",

          "Tromso has served as the embarkation point for countless Arctic expeditions, including Roald Amundsen\u2019s final, fatal flight to attempt a rescue of a missing fellow explorer. This museum documents not only these expeditions, but also life in the far north, including trapping,",
          "To visit this Museum once is not enough. I have decided to come again and feel the atmosphere the great Norwegian explorers lived and have made the preparations for their paths leading to the famous discoveries.",
          "A medium size museum that offers a lot of amazing pictures and stories about incredible explorers. Good for a quick visit, prolly 45 minutes or so.",
          "We didn\u2019t really know what to expect from this place, I\u2019m not a big fan of aquarium but this place was well set out and there seemed like plenty of room for the seals. They are the real stars of the show and worth popping in. It is quite expensive to get in, I imagine it would",
          "This is a museum about Arctic life, the settlers to the Arctic and how they survived. Along with some specific tales of Norwegian explorers. Very interesting museum with a lot to be learned. Something to consider is that Arctic life wasn't always kind. A detailed model of a",
          "While there are a number of museums in Norway that provide information on the Arctic and Antarctic explorers, there are few that provide a background of the hunting and exploitation of the fauna. The history is well presented and a detailed guide is available to borrow which",
          "This museum is set in a lovely old wooden building with shiny wooden floors that creak when you walk. My husband could have spent hours in here dreaming of being an explorer. I loved the photos of the crews and the old city.",
          "3 storey museum. Costs 60kr per adult. Showed a little history of the life of the early settlers in the area.",
          "This museum is very well put-together. We learned a lot from our visit. There was an overwhelming amount of reading, though.",
          "Fascinating displays, but they could have done without the wax figures...it didn\u2019t really add to the experience and they were not very well made. Great photographs and artifacts and a neat environment. We had a guide (from the Historic City Walking Tour), so that made it all the",
          "Although relatively small the museum has some interesting items and is presented very well. we had an engaging couple of hours here and would recommend it.",
          "Lots of good exhibits but most of the information is in Norwegian so unless you have an English speaking guide it it difficult to fully appreciate the captions.",
          "I love polar history so I looked forward to seeing this museum. Whilst the sections on Admusen and the other explorers were really well done and interesting, I found the glorifying of trapping and killing animals like polar bears, confronting. I saw people avoiding certain",
          "Wasn't sure about visiting this museum but turned out to be interesting and worth the entrance fee. Provides a good insight into polar exploration and the hunting that took place from Tromso.",
          "This small museum gives an impression of the first polar expeditions and the difficult circumstances for the people who had to survive in the cold. There are a few really good dioramas showing how the trappers lived. The early winter trapping expeditions to Svalbard",
          "Very interesting exhibitions,reasonable admission price, really gives a feel for the Arctic explorers",
          "We visited the Polar Museum whilst on a cruise to Norway. Extremely well laid out and lots of interesting artefacts. Explanations in English and Norwegian. Thought the gift shop was rather expensive, but well worth the visit.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum which tells us a lot about the Norwegian explorers. Went late morning on a sunny day and not too busy. About half the exhibits had English translations and we were given a printed English guide.",
          "The display of the exhibits may be a bit old fashioned, but the story of the scientists is still quite interesting. Also the descriptions about the hunting of seals for their furs and whales gives a good insight in the Norwegian way of thinking (e.g. when describing the human",
          "A very cool museum on Arctic exploration and life in the polar regions. It is very informative and it is suitable for children.",
          "So, we didn't have loads of time and needed to pick something that we could check out in an afternoon before our tour. I'm glad we came here. You can see different info, exhibits, and stuffed seals. It was interesting to view all the information. They will give you a paper in",
          "This is well worth a visit - amazing histories and stories of the Arctic, whaling, seal hunting etc.",
          "This museum highlights how tough it was for both explorers and those working in fishing and hunting. Good exhibits.",
          "This museum is very interesting but I relied heavily on my basic Norwegian to get the full experience. The lady at the front desk was not very friendly and did not inform me about the possibility of a combination ticket with other museums (this was the first I visited and did",
          "I found this to be a real education, having previously known little about whaling etc, and only a small amount about the arctic expeditions. There was plenty to look at, and although most was in Norwegian, detailed booklets (lots of reading) were supplied for free meaning",
          "Nice museum in the middle of Troms\u00f8 that shows the history of the early settlers in the region, the heritage of Sealing and Polar Bear trapping as well as some of the local legends from the area.",
          "We visited the Polar museum on a week day and we spent around 2 hours there to learn all about the history of legendary hunters / fisherman / explorers back in the day. The items displayed are very interesting and some quite ancient which makes the visit truly worth your time. I",
          "if you want to see what is special about the area of northern NOrway and Svalbard and the people living up here, this is the place to be.",
          "lots of very interesting stuff but presented in a very old fashioned and out dated manner. diassapointing, it could be so much better",
          "This is a quaint museum that is definitely worth a visit if you can spare about 30 mins to an hour. It has a wide variety of historical artifacts going back to the days of the seal fur trade and continuing through the exploration of Nansen and Amundsen. Not expensive, concise,",
          "Good for a quick visit to learn about Tromso and the Arctic. Exhibit isn't in English but they give you a book which tells you about each room.",
          "Really nice museum if you want to know more about the history of the arctic Norway and Troms\u00f8 area. Tip: if you are not familiar woth norwegian language take the english guide!",
          "I didn't really enjoy the lower floors, which have mannequins & mock-ups illustrating various life activities, but I was fascinated by the section dedicated to Fridtjof Nansen. His expedition (in the 1890's), partly on the ship he designed - the Fram - and partly on foot/sledge,",
          "Located on the Harbour, it's worth a visit to learn a bit about the history and life of an arctic fishermen place: fauna, artefacts, North (and South) pole Explorators, living standards. Borrow a brochure in your language from the cashier.",
          "I think is an ok experience nothing special I think they should give audio tour instead of a little brochure",
          "Good place to spend an hour and learn about the Arctic life. Good exhibitions and great to read the histories. Quite OK price as entrance!",
          "Hard to imagine the hardship endured by the early Polar explorers. Arctic exploration explained with excellent early photographs, films and original documents. Definitely worth visiting to get better understanding of Norwegian heroes and the Arctic.",
          "Interesting museum giving good overview of arctic exploration and life. We'll presented exhibits. Returnable guide of museum available in most languages. Relatively inexpensive for Norway",
          "Even though this is a low tech museum, it was full of fascinating displays. The written cards were extremely helpful because most of the displays has Norwegian labels.",
          "I had this opportunity to visit this place and see their culture and simply amazing. Easy to access and people really friendly and helpful.",
          "Extremely interesting. Learned a great deal about the history of the area. Quite extensive exhibits about many of the explorers who started from or passed through Tromso.",
          "The way the exhibition was is build up is very very informative and really honoring the pioneers in Arctic science and Arctic hunting life. Strongly recommended if you are interested in that type of history",
          "I was having higher expectations of this museum. I believe more can be added to attract more visitors.",
          "An interesting visit, more so than I anticipated. Some of the exhibits are explained in English, most not, but you are supplied with a guide book giving information on what is in each room. And as you move upstairs there are 10 or more small rooms filled with items. You do need",
          "I found this museum a bit depressing and not quite as advertised. I found the whole museum was primary about whaling, sealing and hunting in the arctic. I understand this was the way of life here, but I found the museum a bit dusty and just filled with stuffed animals, which",
          "The museum is quite extensive over two floors. The early part of the planned route through the museum concentrates on life in the Arctic and the Seal, Whale and Polar bear hunting. For me this was a bit depressing although you have to accept that this was the accepted way of",

          "I went on a walking tour of the city and the Polar Museum was the first place we stopped at. There are a lot of very interesting things to see in here including a mummified woman. Many exhibits, life in the Artic, inside of a tapper home, polar bears..............",
          "This museum is very interesting. Some exhibitions and quite a lot to read but its an interesting read about polar expeditions. Def recommended!",
          "The museum shows a good story of how people survived and lived in the arctic including some of the pioneers. A lot of focus on hunting which may not be to everyone's taste but it is a lot of what people did in the arctic during these times.",
          "An interesting museum as long as you do not mind the stuffed / wax exhibits. We did not have very long to look around and some of the information did not appear to be translated from the native language. The guides seemed friendly but one of the reception staff was certainly not.",
          "It's a good way to spend an hour or so and it isn't expensive. But the focus is on the hunting history of the area and my kiddos were a little shocked.",
          "at first I was not keen. but the films were good and eye opening. a little crowded at the feeding tanks. shop good. a nice cafeteria would not go a miss",
          "The Polar Museum tells the story of Arctic trapping and courageous polar expeditions. Located in former Customs House on the quayside dating from 1830. Tromso was the centre of seal hunting in North Norway, and the town was established at the Gateway to the Arctic in the late",

          "well done exhibition about arctic life and mission to north pole. Lots of objects and memorabilia to check out for the fans of details. Most of the signs are in norvegian only, but the ticket office gives you a your-own-language free booklet guide with translations. Cheap",
          "We were pleasantly surprised with our visit here as from the outside it didn\u2019t look much. A myriad of information and displays, detailed history of Norway\u2019s polar exploration and key players in that history. Quite a revelation.",
          "Really good little museum telling the story of the local area, whaling, seals, explorers, etc. There\u2019s a free English (and I think lots of other languages) guide book with plenty of information, and there\u2019s some really interesting exhibits. We spent about 2 hours looking round.",
          "the museum is within walking distance from the ship. No admission charge. I enjoyed learning facts of the region and the polar bears.",
          "I recommend to visit this place and to deepen the history of the Fram voyage. It\u2019s amazing. Worth a visit",
          "Spent 2hrs goung around this museum. We picked up an English guidebook at the start which offered the bright level of information as you walked around. There are not any interactive exhibits but there are lots of artefacts from expeditions and many stuffed animals. Worth a",
          "Great exposition with many informations. A lot of items from the expeditions of Amundsen and Nansen.",
          "Interesting museum to spend an hour or two. Clear explanantion on how the north pole was conquered and how people used to get their income from hunting animals in the past. It must have been a very harsh time back then. A bit of a drawback is the fact that most of the comments",

          "Definitely worth a visit. We stopped in with our three year old, and, although lots of the exhibition was aimed at adults, there was a lot to keep younger children entertained. For the grown ups it\u2019s an essential guide to Norway\u2019s exploring history, with great details and",
          "We went here not really knowing what to expect. We got given an English information book when we arrived as all the exhibits were in Norwegian. The book was very informative. The rooms themselves contained lots of interesting exhibits, mainly about hunting and trapping. We",
          "We found this place full of information. As people from the other side of the world, it was a great insight into arctic exploration. The exhibits were absorbing too. An English info book was available which was a big help.",
          "There are several museums in Tromso and deciding which one to visit was tricky. Decided on the Polar Museum as felt it would give us the most insight into the area.  Housed in a red warehouse style building in the harbour / docks it's well signposted and easy to find. I'd",
          "This museum is housed in an old, rustic warehouse kind of building, but inside it has a huge and varied collection of arctic life, animals and expeditions. We get an idea about all these after going through all the interconnected rooms. Every exhibit is named and explained.",

          "I was delighted by this museum housed in a fine old building by the harbour. There were several rooms with superb tableaux of Arctic life and amazing taxidermy; the animals so real. Amundsen is well known but Dr Nansen\u2019s attempt to reach the North Pole and his subsequent Nobel",
          "A museum that doesn\u2019t shy away from its history, no matter how Non-pc some of the subject matter may be. Yes some areas concerned with trapping, whaling or seal pups will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, however the museum is so much more. Fantastic exhibition on the Polar explorers",
          "The small Polar museum is very interesting and holds many good exhibits to learn more about the polar life, expeditions and history. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to see everything. I can recommend it to everyone visiting Troms\u00f6.",
          "This museum provides a great insight to the history of the region, it\u2019s culture and of Amundsen\u2019s explorations. It\u2019s certainly worth a visit. If you only have time to visit the polaria or here then go here.",

          "\" A good museum to visit when in Tromso. It explains you a bit of history and of tradition of the life and of the artic culture. With several rooms but not boring. A bit traditional maybe they can improve using some new technology. As an overall good experience to do and it does",

          "A lot of interesting information in the museum. All information was stated in Norweigen, but it was possible to have information in other languge if needed. It was interesting to read about the polar expeditons performed during 19th Century.",
          "Very telling and showing museum. Tells a lot about polar expeditions. It is bigger then first thought and very cheap.",
          "Hidden on the harbour side and not particularly well sign posted although in all the tourist brochures. Costs about 60kn entrance and offered a guide book in several languages to be returned on leaving. The displays are mainly in Norwegian and the guide is very word- oriented",

          "We really didn't like the place from the moment we walked in, but the life-size model of a white guy clubbing a baby seal was when we just decided to leave. This is no museum -- there is very little that offers to teach. The story of exploiting the environment and killing off as",
          "We had 4 hours stopover in Tromso with Hurtigruten. We followed the signs for the Polar Museum, but the route was rather more convoluted than necessary, and could be done in 15 minutes if you knew where you were going. It's an interesting little museum, spread over 2 floors,",
          "Lovely little museum, even if small it gives you a glimpse of the polar lifestyle, Tromso's history and gives you an overview of what does it mean to be born above the Arctic! Worth to spend there 1 hour or so.",
          "I didn't really planned the visit, but I had a day in between some active tours and decided for sightseeing Troms\u00f8, which included a visit to the Polar Museum. It's definitely not the largest museum on earth, but the setup with separated rooms gives structure in the tour",
          "The museum was clean, had a lot of historical information and translation books in a variety of languages for each to understand artifacts. The building itself was historical as well and had lovely wood floors well cared for. It was easy to get here right on the waterfront, had",
          "Very small museum but rich in historical findings. Very interesting to see how poorly dressed were the first explorers that dared to reach the North Pole. I liked the exhibitions. Please be aware that the museum is very small so it will take you maximum 1 hour to see it.",

          "The small exterior dimensions of the beautiful building that houses the Polarmuseet overlooking the Troms\u00f8's harbor could mislead the richness of the interior exposure; nothing more wrong because the Polarmuseet offers a very interesting and complete collection that guides the",

          "The museum actually contains quite a lot of information about what life was like for those living in in tromso whilst hunting for polar bears and seals. It's quite detailed-if you are looking for anything on Sami culture or anything this probably isn't the right place for you,",
          "A very interesting museum which tells the story of polar life and exploration. The building itself is also of historic interest. A good choice for an hour or so.",
          "On entry I was given a well thumbed pamphlet in English on some of the exhibits. I found this a bit difficult to follow and kept having to refer back to the right page to find the text. Most exhibits are in Norwegian which I found strange for such a touristy city. Most if not",

          "Really enjoyed this museum, although you had to read the guide book in English as you were going round it really gave you a flavour of what the polar explorers endured on their journeys and how they survived in the extreme conditions. Well worth a visit",
          "We visited the Polar Museum on our second day in Troms\u00f8 to fill in a couple of spare hours we had. At only 60NOK per person we weren't expecting a great deal, it exceeded expectations! We were handed a booklet which explained the displays in English which came in very helpful.",
          "This is a must see in Tromso. The displays are fascinating with history of the region, of Admundsen, of Samii culture and more. It is easy to reach but be careful if there in the winter because of ice on the streets. Once inside, it is very comfortable. There are some English",
          "I recommend visiting the museum at the beginning of your trip to Troms\u00f8, it is fascinating and awe inspiring to learn what the polar explorers had to endure. And if you happen to go on a husky trip afterwards it puts what they endured into sharp perspective",
          "Troms\u00f8 museum is well worth the visit. English booklet explaining exhibits given as you go in. Nice and close to city centre.",
          "Small but very informative, make sure you get the English guide from the front counter (as you would expect) it\u2019s all in Norwegian",
          "It's a basic museum that is certainly not high tech or interactive so it's probably more interesting for adults than children. It's old fashioned in a charming way, and they have created a lot of anachronistic spaces that make you feel like you're in the past. The stories they",
          "Not a very large museum but interesting history of the Tromso area- learned a lot but not a must see.",
          "It was a great stop there, not a really great museum but very informative. We could connect that with my other comment \u201epolar bear society\u201c. It is very historic and beautiful animal shown with love.",
          "I found this museum a bit challenging (seal skins etc) but it is a part of the Norwegian history and it is very informative. Seals are not killed for their skins anymore. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I visited the Polar Museum whilst in Troms\u00f8 on holiday. I was very thankful as the staff provided me with and English booklet as I can\u2019t read Norwegian. The booklet was very useful however a lot of the displays are still written in Norwegian. A notably difficult room to grasp",
          "We had a booklet in English to follow to the museum through it's 11 rooms. This was sufficient for me to understand what was being exhibited and being abroad, I would not have expected for it to labeled in English. The museum gives a story of survival in the arctic and how it",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Polar Museum. It is divided up into \"Rooms\" and we were given a book in English to read, which followed the rooms as we went. This worked well for me as I love reading. My husband, not so much. He's a slow reader and takes a while to comprehend.",
          "As a new local I wanted to learn more about Northern Norway, Tromsoe, etc. The Polar Museum is a nice, educative museum about the city's history, arctic exploring, sealing, etc. It's small but that didn't matter to me. Take your time to check out everything while you walk around",
          "The museum is small and perhaps a little old-fashioned as it has stuffed animals and panoramas to show the life of the 19th C Artic with its whaling and sealing history. Nonetheless is it interesting to see the adventures of Amundsen and other Arctic explorers. The descriptions",
          "This museum contains a lot of information, artefacts, and dioramas with a focus on Svalbard, the Arctic, and some of the landmark explorations by Amundsen and Nansen. You also learn about hunting the large animals of the Arctic. Most of the exhibition is in Norwegian without",
          "A lot of valuable informatuin. Yiuvare provided with a small booklet in English or another language of your choice. If you take the time to read the booklet with the exhibits there is a lot of valuable information. If you are interested in Nansen and Amensen two if the famous",
          "The display was awesome and mammals and mannequin were so real. The museum backtrack to early days on life in the Artic and at the end of the tour one will get a good understanding. Don't forget to take lots of picture with the display as background. The Polar Museum is not",
          "The museum provided an interesting insight to history of the region. Most of the displays are in Norwegian but the guide books provided are well laid out and provide all the information.",
          "The North Pole Museum is a small museum which exhibits the way of life in the arctic region. It is divided in small rooms, which all cover other themes. You receive a booklet in English at the information desk, because all the written information in the museum in in Norsk (which",
          "I enjoyed my visit here far more than I thought I would. The entire place is laid out extremely well and gives an insight into the History of Norway\u2019s people, their way of life, and the accomplishments of some of their most famous explorers-all information I realised I knew",
          "Very interesting stories from early polar expeditions. Most of the displays are written in Norwegian but we were given a booklet explaining most section in English. Worth a visit!",
          "Good Norse history very interesting artefacts well worth visiting,everything well laid out with easy access,cafe and toilets on site",
          "Spend an hour or so, great value for money.I really liked the set ups about the hunters, with the sound effects.",
          "A very small museum which takes about different polar expeditions and about Ronald amuldson , Svalbard history ... Was not having any expectations before i went but it was better than i felt.",
          "It\u2019s a small museum (all Troms\u00f8 site seeings places are small!) but nice and good to know about the arctic life. Souvenirs have good selections as well. We bought polar bear T-shirts for whole family here.",
          "The other downtown Tromso museum is, like Polaria, modest and won\u2019t require more than a couple of hours to see unless you can read Norwegian. Unlike Polaris, it\u2019s housed over 2.5 floors in an old warehouse (so oozes charm and history) with exposed wood walls and original",
          "This small museum can easily be visited in 1.5 to 2 hours also with children. It gives a good idea of the life of arctic pioneers and of arctic hunters. It provides comprehensive information about the trip of Nansen abord the Fram. It completes nicely the visit of the Fram",
          "Very interesting museum telling the story of the first settlers and explorers of the area. Reasonably priced entrance fee and a guide in English. Some of the signage is in English too.",
          "Looks like a small hut at the back alley, not very interesting, I suppose quite educational but overall boring",
          "It is a very interesting museum about polar life and discoveries and expeditions into Arctic. Worth visiting it if you spend some time in Tromso or in the region. Easy to understand and suitable for children. The visit is about 1 hour (minimum)",
          "Worth a visit but don\u2019t go out of your way. Lots of history, but you can\u2019t really appreciate it all as not translated. The staff provide a booklet in english which is helpful.",
          "The museum gives an excellent overview of the history of polar expeditions. It has a wonderful collection of artifacts (including stuffed animals) and the displays are well done. The museum does not have English (and German) translations at all places but together with the",
          "If you're visiting Tromso this museum is well worth a visit. I spent a couple of hours looking at the displays and loved all the information about polar life. Highly recommended.",
          "The museum focuses on early Arctic life in the region, including detailed coverage of the more notable over-Arctic expeditions, including Amundsen and Nansen. It is well curated, and has plenty of visual exhibits to keep the narratives interesting, for kids also.",
          "Surprisingly interesting museum. Some exhibits make you feel personally involved. Definitely recommended!",
          "This university museum reflects exploration of manly men going off to the frozen tundra to see what they could see, and hunt. Who knew there were so many seal varieties? For those who view animal pelts and trophies with horror, or even dismay, this will be hellish, but the",
          "This is a small museum with a lot packed into it. The area grew on hunting so dont get offened by some of the exhibits. That was life then",
          "We had a good time going through the Museum. It is very well planned and informative. One can spend a couple of hours at this place and gain lot of knowledge of this region.",
          "A good little museum. Well thought out and it gives you an insight into the hardships of the early settlers and explorers of the region. There is a little booklet that is given to you in your language. And some of the exhibits are written in English and German as well as",
          "Easy to get to, full of interesting information, very reasonable. Quite enjoyable afternoon, learned all about seal hunting history.",
          "it was 10~15 min walk from the hotel we stayed. a small by very interesting museum of polar expedition. oh, yes, I remember the story of Amundsen and Scott in my primary school class. of course there were much and many more. later on this trip we also visited the polar ship",
          "The Polar Museum is a cozy museum that I could learn about the artic, though it's mostly old-fashioned and the language is all Norwegian. The staff does give out a manual, but I could see that it wasn't well kept; the manual was mostly ripped and damaged. Overall, the museum is",
          "Right on the waterfront this museum gives to a taste of old Tromso. Polar bears, exploration and mans determination to survive in the wilderness. Worth a visit, it took us an hour but we were interested. A guide book in English helps!",
          "The museum it self is very old-fashioned and hardly features any translation. You get an worn-out paper print with all the translations. The objects itself are presentated in a very old-fashioned way. The museum focuses on hunting and the exploration of the North Pole. However,",
          "This museum is located in the Troms\u00f8 town centre. There are plenty of information about the history of fishing and hunting in the Artic region. The visitor's experience could be improved by adding more descriptions in English, an audioguide would be advisable. Reading the",
          "An excellent museum which left you understanding everything that you needed to know about polar exploration.",
          "This museum was really informative and shed a lot of light on the history of sealing and whaling. You learn a lot about polar exploration and despite all displays not being in English as well, you will be given an English guidebook full of information.",
          "Thankfully we went with a guide as most of the written information is not in English , but the displays were very good and you could touch them feel the different in the animals Fur it\u2019s based over 3 floors with no lift but nice place to send a hour or two",
          "It looks small on the outside, but this little museum is filled with interesting history and stories about polar exploration. Artefacts from expeditions, biographical information about explorers, replicas of living conditions, etc. are all interesting. It is easy to spend an",
          "Fortunately we had a guided tour of this place which made it so much more interesting! Most of the picture, exhibits etc. had signage in Norwegian - very very few had English & German script.",
          "We visited the Polar Museum in November in Tromso and found it quite exciting. There was info. on The Arctic exploration, seal hunting for necessity and Arctic life.",
          "Learn about the hunting and exploration of the Norwegian peoples history, a lot of effort has been put into the displays, worth a visit, it is only small so can fit in the visit with 90 mins.",
          "Opportunity to find out more about people and place history, travelers and researchers, interesting exhibits and extensive explanations for them.",
          "We've visited couple of other places and museums in Tromso but this one was definitely the number one spot! Although I am not a supporter of violence against the animals, I was very interested to see the exposition, which shows you clearly the history of hunting and life in the",
          "A small museum, well presented showing polar exploration, and some of the former exploits of man. Unsurprisingly mainly the arctic, but a bit on the Antarctic too. Most of the labels are in Norwegian but a handy English leaflet is available. Worth an hour!",
          "There was so much information in this museum about the exploration and explorers of the region. It was well set out and the displays were really great. I would consider this a must do.",
          "Museums are not normally my thing but when one is walking around Tromso in a bitter winter wind at -5% any detour indoors is very welcome and to my great surprise I really enjoyed this little museum.Its not very expensive to get in and its full of the regions history as whalers",
          "This was the first stop of our Trip from our Cruise. To be honest, I would not have chosen to visit but it was okay. It showed a lot of history of Tromso and most of the museum was in written in Norwegian but we were lucky that our guide gave us an overview. Lots of stuffed",
          "We really enjoyed our visit. So informative and really well set out with many good graphics and displays. The museum gives you a great insight into Norwegian and Sami culture. Very informative on many Polar expeditions which set out from Tromso. Highly recommend you visit.",
          "Spent an interesting couple of hrs here. Has great displays about Norwegian polar exploration and also polar hunting. Guides provided in different languages as most displays in Norwegian.",
          "I guess this would largely depend on the tour guide, but I struck it lucky. There is so much to learn about the past activities in Norway's Arctic Regions. Visitors gain the most by being tolerant of previous sanctioned activities and can learn of the hardships faced, the",
          "This museum is not too big but gives an nice overview of what happened at the north poles. Since everything is written in Norwegian, you get a small booklet with the translation. This was very helpful and made this museum a nice experience! Something you need to visit when you",
          "A well presented museum however could benefit with more translations innEnglish. Possibly audio commentary.",
          "A great small museum with lots of interesting exhibits (and stuffed animals) detailing the history of Arctic exploration and hunting. Buy the combined ticket with the Tromso University Museum.",
          "A very interesting Museum covering the story of Road Amundsen's trip to the North Pole and Life in general in the Artic conditions. Really worth a visit and is very interesting. If you are 67 then you qualify for concessionary entrance.",
          "Relatively small museum with lots of interesting perspectives of polar life. Given an English guide to use in the museum but some more English translated signage next to the exhibits would have helped.",
          "Museum has plenty of exhibits. Most is not translated to English. You are given a booklet to read to describe exhibits. Warning there are details of seal hunting, trapping and killing walruses but it is part of their history.",
          "We did a polar history walk organised through our Norwegian Cruise line. A beautiful lit city but rain and sleet the whole time. The museum was informative but do not like to hear about the way animals had been massacred in vast numbers by these explorers. Today they are still",
          "In this museum you can learn all about tromso and all about polar expeditions,so amazing to learn how people in that times live with all they have,so much things to see and learn in this polarmuseet.",
          "I\u2019m not sure what I expected this Museum to be but I didn\u2019t expect it to be full of stuffed animals. I love animals and I didn\u2019t like this place! We didn\u2019t stay long, the Seals eyes were looking at me! There were wolves, polar bears, seals etc. I know this was normal for them to",
          "This small museum stood head and shoulders above a similar museum in Oslo. Its forte was an in-depth and narrow focus on a few polar expeditions. Well done Polarmuseet.",
          "We hoped to get more of an insight into the region and it was informative but not inspiring and the English booklet was a little dull... If you don't like stuffed animals it's best avoided! It is a little brutal but then so was the way of life of the arctic circle.",
          "Wonderful displays and detailed history of Polar expeditions. So much to see. Plan on spending several hours to get details or quick walk-through for a great overview. Very nice layout, professionally displayed in very old red wharf building which adds to the allure. Extremely",
          "Quite fascinating displays from the obvious Roald Amundssen to the different breeds of seals and their skins. Veri informative even if a lot isn't translated from Norwegian.",
          "It's nice to see some stories of the north pole explorers, but should be nice to see more real furniture.",
          "A good museum about polar life, with an emphasis on hunting and trapping. This means that children or sensitive animal lovers might be disturbed by the exhibits. If you can accept them in their historical context, it is very informative. Could use better and more extensive",
          "The Polar museum has exhibitions that explain much about the history of Norway, its people, its animals/fish, the expeditions by its explorers and climate change. I definitely recommend it!",
          "Worth a short visit. Lots of exhibits not translated, but interesting to look at nonetheless. History of Amundsen's treks is fascinating. Good exhibits recreating gory hunting past - kids loved that!",
          "It was good to see factual representation of history even though some was harsh. Well presented and in an interesting building.",
          "The museum provides quite a lot of information related to wildlife in the arctic. Loads of information is also available about the various expeditions through centuries for whaling, sealing and other commercial explorations and lifestyle in the arctic through the same period.",
          "Nice little museum with many informations about the North. There is a lot to see, from stuffed animals to a rebuilt cottage and ship models. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Really glad I went here. Museum gave some interesting information about polar exploration and was a nice and cheap activity. The only downsides is that the book that they give you that explains the exhibits in English was filled with grammar/spelling errors and was something",
          "The museum was very interesting and informative. It showed the history of Norway\u2019s arctic region and polar exploration. It had lots of displays and had a guide book in English to make it easy to work you way around.",
          "The Polar museum is a must for those interested in deeper knowledge about 2 Norwegian explorers in particular ( Amundsen& Nansen), and about Norwegian pioneering expeditions and seal hunting in general. The ground floor is dedicated to early history about life and hunting in",
          "The museum building is located by the sea so we quite enjoyed to walk to. The exhibition is about the arctic life in early 20th century. very interesting.",
          "We loved this polar museum. It told us a lot about polar exploration we didn't know and was well worth the time spent. It made us feel like \"old hands\" when we visited the Fram/Gjoa museum in Oslo, as we had become acquainted with the basics in Tromso.",
          "It was well laid out, but a little too hot inside although they did have coat and bag storage which was definitely required. Great to get to know the history of the region but with stairs probably not suitable for everyone",
          "Really great museum about life and living in the Arctic. Could use some more English translations, but the book they provided was a great reference for what we were seeing. Plan on spending at least an hour here going through all the rooms and topics.",
          "The hunting of seals and whales is a sensistive subject, but this museum did a good job of putting it into the perspective of the city's, and country's history. I learned a lot about Arctic Explorers and really enjoyed the story of the woman taxi driver Wanny Waldstad who was",
          "Really interesting history of polar exploration from whaling through to Amundsen and beyond. You do need not to be judgmental about whaling etc. The displays are very interesting and there is lots to take in. Not ideal for young children as not a hands on type of museum. There",
          "This is a very interesting museum that takes the visitor through the walrus and seal hunting history of Norway as well as highlighting the life and work of Roald Amundsen.",
          "Well presented, a lot to see, English booklet almost too much to absorb as well as view. Much history and brings the hardship of the Arctic into reality.",
          "A very good experience with some interesting exhibits explaining Norway's Polar Exploration Adventures. The museum gives a true feeling of the hardships and problems encountered by these intrepid explorers.",
          "This museum tells you about polar expeditions. Especially, I remember the rooms dedicated to fur hunters who would stay over winter on Polar islands.",
          "The museum has a very wide range of exhibits relating to Norway and the Arctic. There are several dioramas of Arctic life, and numerous exhibits which were actually used on expeditions. The atmosphere is excellent, and the museum very informative and well worth a visit. It is",
          "Whilst the quality of the displays are excellent there is limited English translations. The museum is small and was over crowded on the rainy day that we visited. I would advise going to a different museum in Tromso unless you have a guide who can provide commentary.",
          "This is a short stop-over to Tromso. It's not a huge museum so don't expect too much but you'll get to see lot's of dead animal skins. It's quite difficult to understand the flow since there's not much english translation. They give you an English booklet which is quite long to",
          "Worth visiting-- it ums up the area well and you can have your photo taked next to a polar bear (stuffed!) Buy a combined ticket fopr a ll the museums and cable car.",
          "I really enjoyed visiting this museum. Fascinating displays about Norwegian Polar explorers and hunting. They gave us an English packet when we walked in that had a little material for each room we visited. I was pretty obvious, however, that there was way more explanation on",
          "Raining and an impromptu pop in to the museum , located about 300 metres from the warf. . This is a small but very interesting museum with lots of info on climate change , sea ice formation , history on the discovery of the north and south poles . Stuffed huskies ,sea lions",
          "The museum was very interesting and gave you a good insight into early life in the region. Many of the signs not in English and our visit enhanced by all the stories by a local guide.",
          "We were fortunate to have a local guide for some of the exhibits. Amazing amount of history and information in a small place. This was all in a rustic two-story structure with rooms at many different levels. The Norwegians have a long history of exploration, especially at",
          "Great location and nice building, with a wooden je-ne-sais-quoi who takes you right into an exploration atmosphere. A lot of information and many objects are in display. 2 hours if you wanted to read everything. Nevertheless, it might be time for a make over. Audioguides,",
          "You can learn about the early (hard) living in the Arctic. Hunting, survival and explorations. Also there was at the time a very interesting exhibition about the importance of the northern icecap.",
          "Tromso was the starting point for many Arctic Expeditions. This museum highlights late 19th and early 20th century exploration of Arctic regions. The third floor is devoted to the Fridtjof Nansen expedition and his ship the Fram. Second floor is for Amundsen and aerial",
          "This was a fascinating visit; there is very little information in English but we had a wonderful guide called Morganne and I should like to recommend her if you are on a trip where you need to ask for a guide. We were on a cruise and thus it was organised by them and not us as",
          "An interesting museum which would have more to offer foreign visitors if information was provided in English as well as Norwegian. You are given a sheet in English but it covers only a fraction of what there is to see.",
          "Small museum but packed with history of exploring the polar regions. Pretty interesting. One drawback is space. If there are more than one large group in the place it gets very difficult to navigate your way through the exhibits. You can explore in an hour or take a few",
          "This museum concentrates on Arctic trapping and hunting on the ground floor. The 1st floor is mostly about exploration of the North Pole with particular emphasis on Roald Amundsen's attempts at the North and South Poles and displays about Henry Rudi and Wanny Woldstad, the",
          "A very interesting museum, lot of history about Norway and Arctic in general. Unfortunately all the information is in local language, and at the entrance they give you a small book in your language with some description of what you are going to see, but sometimes it's difficult",
          "Mainly about arctic expedition, polar life. The museum is small, but has a lot of items, so it takes about one hour or more to check everything.",
          "This is a wonderful exhibit with so much amazing memorabilia. Some of the exhibits are a touch gruesome but that is what it was like in those early days. You have to admire the men and women exploring the polar areas. You could easily spend a couple of hours here as there is so",
          "Rather disappointing. Exhibits rather worn. Do you want to see polystyrene seagulls with fake guano? The real animals were nice when you caught a glimpse of them. Don't rush here",
          "Although hunting is frowned upon theses days, this is a fascinating exhibition showing the terrible conditions that early explorers faced in the Arctic. The MV Polstjerna is a little further along the quay.",
          "In Norway they hunt wales, yes, those wales you make a trip to see them in nature. They also eat seal oil pills. Ad yes, still in the year 2017, where you could think thats old fashioned and unnecessary. If you have a problem with seeing stuffed animals and weapons to kill these",
          "Fascinating museum with so many varied and unexpected things to see - sealing hunting is not something for faint hearted but was part of the history. If u wanted to one could spend hours - would be good for families, school trip there whilst we were there. Outdoor clothes can be",
          "Like many Northern Norway museums this is strong on artefacts but less so on interpretation. If you speak Norwegian or German you will be fine, but English monoglots struggled because the translation, in a booklet, was difficult to correlate with exhibits. That being said, the",
          "Nothing much to see but at Tromso it is a must visit attraction for tourist. We enjoyed this museum,",
          "Very interesting museum with a lof information about the arctic and svalbard. It takes around an hour to visit the museum and it can be combined with a walk on the seaside.",
          "There is so much interesting stuff in this museum about the arctic explorers and life between Tromso and Svalbad from its discovery until now. We spent an hour in there and could have spent longer if it weren't for the crowds of tourist groups taking over.",
          "We enjoyed seeing the inside of this old building as well as the exhibits. The history is interesting- watch your head as the door frames are original and low!",
          "This was a disappointing museum. The flow of the museum doesn't make much sense. The English guide (remember to ask for it!) really leaves you floundering. Also if you are an individual traveller you may be denied or delayed entry in favour of groups. That said i appreciated",
          "I called it excellent but - much of it is about how anything that could be hunted was hunted, and some still is. So be warned. A lot about the mechanics of killing, arctic foxes crushed with deadfall traps and polar bears shot in the face by gun traps are things that stand out",
          "A most informative display that tells what it was like in the arctic when explorers were seeking to reach the poles. Also the conditions that the indigenous people had to endure to settle and live in such an extreme environment. Well worth the visit.",
          "We stumbled upon the museum by chance when sightseeing in Troms\u00f8 and popped in. I learnt a great deal about Norwegian history that I was completely unaware of. The translations into English made it very easy to navigate the museum.",
          "It's worth to visit this Polar Museum as you can know more about how people lived in Arctic over a hundred years ago! Just like traveling to the past by time machine, experienced it by spending NOK60 (May 12, 2017) for the visit. Around 2 hours needed at least if you're",
          "Handed an English booklet on entry to rather expensive attraction. Hardly any signs were in English, and then were not detailed in the booklet. Would not recommend to English visitors.",
          "Fairly quaint, but very informative museum. A lot of cool Arctic information about life in the Arctic and life in early Tromso. Definitely worth an hour or two",
          "I enjoyed the museum very much. I have an interest in polar explorers already and there was a lot I already knew, but there was a lot a new information provided. The one downside was that a lot of the exhibits didn't have a translated description. Thankfully I was with my Danish",
          "As we went in we thought it might not be very interesting, but it got more and more so as we progressed round the series of rooms. There are many displays of original artefacts from early polar exploration. We especially enjoyed the well documented stories of Amundsen and Nansen",
          "Well mantained space and artefacts. Well documented historically and geographically. A place not to be missed.",
          "I believe that all museum-items in Tromso coud be concentrated in one bigger museum. As they are, there are not enough materials to sustain separate museums.",
          "The aquarium in a tiny pool with 4 seals nervously swimming around and now and then jumping up to the trainers. There's an auditorium where a frenetic film of the Svalabard island is shown on a 180 degree screen.",
          "If ever in Tromso a visit to the Polar Museum is very worthwhile. The exhibitions cover sealing and Arctic/Antarctic exploration with a strong emphasis on the explorer Ronald Admundsen.",
          "The exhibits were wonderful to learn about the polar explorers. They had a good English translation guide at the front desk which was helpful, because individual exhibits were not always labeled in English. This museum was one of our reasons for visiting Tromso, and we were not",
          "The museum does an excellent job of sharing the history of polar ice exploration and habitation. Because all the signage is in Norwegian they give you a translated booklet to guide you through the facility.",
          "Just like its sister museum, Troms\u00f8 Museum, this place has a lot of interesting stuff and you can spend hours here, if you are interested in polar explorers. But the place is old and needs a redesign soon.",

          "It was snowing...so we were unable to see birds and the lake was frozen but the place is really nice, you can walk along the lake safely there are lights to show you the way and the place is beautiful at night with snow flakes everywhere",
          "This is a perfect hour-or-so walk from Tromso. Absolutely beautiful (frozen when we were there) lake with great views of the mountains too.",
          "We visited on our honeymoon as a recommended place to view the northern lights.. The first night was cloudy but still really cool there.. The lake was frozen and the path around very snowy with people skiing.. The last night before we left we returned and spent five hours",
          "I had the good fortune to walk there straight after a night of heavy snowfall. Really beautiful. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "The tourist information center gave me a tourist map and said it\u2019s a thirty minute walk with signs. I saw only two signs. I suggest using Google maps to catch all of the turns. It took me about 50 minutes to walk there because I have hip trouble and am over age 60. The lake is",
          "Nature at glimpse. The walkway around lake is easy. Fine way if you want to avoid steep paths. One hour is more than enough.",
          "The lake was frozen solid and covered with snow but it still looked beautiful. very easy walk from town centre. cannot wait to return in the summer",
          "Good place to spend time and relax. If you are a skiing enthusiast then this is the place to be. You will love it for sure:)",

          "We walked here from our Airbnb in the snow, absolutely lovely place - we did a circuit and enjoyed watching the locals cross-country skiing.",
          "Walked up one evening from city centre. Very uphill walk so a bit tiring but good views of the city on the way up. It's difficult to 'rate' a lake out of 5!! It was as expected, a beautiful expanse of snow surrounded by trees. I can imagine it is lovely if you can spot the",
          "We went here to see a sunset. Well, ok, it is not possible to see a complete sunset because of these trees around the lake and the mountains in the distance but we decided to go to the center of the lake and it was amazing experience. Since the water was frozen and it was cold",
          "A beautiful lake on the mountains in the city, nice ways for hiking and skiing, directly at the Lysl\u00f8ypa, great for watching the aurora!",
          "The Prestvannet is a beautiful lake and area to visit. Both during day but also during night. The cross country ski track starts at Prestvannet, just 1 kilometer from the city center og 10 by bus no 40. The track i illimunated during night time. The best in Troms\u00e5 town to see",
          "Great place to search for the northern lights. Lake was completely frozen and people were skiing and ice skating. Very pretty place to walk around in the winter",

          "If you walk out to the centre of the frozen lake, then you have a great field of vision - pretty much 360 degrees. There is a little light from the path around the perimeter of the lake, but it really doesn't impact the viewing, and I even got some good photos just using my",
          "Its a quiet lake just a 20 minute climb up the hill from the city center (not too steep). Its facing North so its a good spot to watch out for the Aurora at night time or go ice skating or sledding during the day time.",
          "Whilst up on the mountain behind the cable car I'd seen this patch of white in the middle of the city and figured it must be a park. So the following day we went off on a hunt to find it. Even though we had a map, we made a few wrong turns before finding signage that helped",
          "It's about half an hour uphill to reach the lake from the city center. Around the lake is a 1,7km walkway, with skiing tracks as well. It was really nice to get away from the city a bit and enjoy the scenery.",
          "Not worth a trip in itself but as part of a journey it's worth stopping off. It is very scenic but you can say that about many places in the island. (note: this is in winter time over the frozen lake)",
          "I went there for a walk with my husband, sister and child aged 9. We didn't take the bus and it was a good choice because we could look at the landscape and the child (and the mum) could slide up and down the hills covered by snow. We had great fun, the lake was frozen and we",
          "Went there for a walk just before taking our plane. One hour of a magical walk. During that time of the year, you can walk on the frozen lake. The landscapes are just gorgeous!",
          "Great place to observe Northern Lights in winter only half an hour walking from the city center. Went there in the evening of December 26 and observed vivid northern lights in the sky. Good alternative to expensive (and also wonderful) tours hunting for the northern lights.",
          "Great place for hiking or running, or bird-watching in the summer. In the winter, you can see the aurora and sometimes ice skating or skiing. Great for outdoor-lovers",
          "This lake is on the middle of the Troms\u00f8 island, and the lake, and surrounding area is peaceful, and really nice. The hike around the lake is about 1.7 km, making it perfect for a little walk with kids, that you can combine with feeding the birds during the summer season, but",
          "On the recommendations of several people in town, we walked up to the lake one night to try to catch a glimpse of the northern lights. It's a wide open area that is somewhat away from the city lights, providing a nice view of the night sky. Although we had a clear night, there",
          "We walked from the main town up to this lake through much settled snow in December. Whilst the walk was quite a distance, it was stunning. It meant we walked past areas of town we might have missed, and really got to see the Nordic architecture of residential houses (teemed",
          "One of my favorite place in Troms\u00f8. This is also a great spot to see the aurora borealis at night. Prestvannet is also very nice during summer time. The place is so picturesque.",
          "I spent a night here for the northern light (but in vain) and the next day I came here again during the day. It is very beautiful that the lake was surrounded by the mountains and trees. I sat here just enjoying the view and silence for hours.",
          "In this area, it is a short ride by local bus from the city center for a great view of possibly seeing the Northern Lights on a clear night. It can be very cold below freezing with the wind blowing. I had to wear a double down jacket, two sets of thermal underwear, bring feet",
          "as it is very dark.. you can come here and see the northern lights. it will take about 30 minutes to walk from tromso, but it is a lovely walk.",
          "It was snowing a lot after more than a week and we walked to the lake and around it was a true winter wonderland. Loved our time at the lake and around to see it all covered in snow!",
          "My wife and I took a romantic evening stroll to the frozen lake after dinner one evening in the snow. The lake is in the north of the island from the centre which is relatively elevated from sea level and therefore quite a tough walk if you're not used to hill walking. The",
          "Great footpath up rom the centre and round the frozen lake around a couple of hours there and back from the centre in heavy snow",
          "In summer nights, birds go crazy because of the lights and their noise is deafening. This is a great spot for bird watching and to see the norther lights in winter.",
          "We took bus number 40 from Tromso city centre up to Prestvannet Lake . The cost of the bus was NOK50 each so fairly expensive, however once there, there are plenty of trails and walks to enjoy. There are cross country ski tracks that are lit in winter and many locals seems to",
          "We walked up to the lake from the centre of town - approx 20 minutes. It is all uphill but easily accessible. You will definitely warm yourself up if you walk there! The views of the frozen lake and mountains in the background were beautiful so definitely worth the trip.",
          "A lovely place to see the Aurora from - if you're lucky. If not, it's a really nice walk - wrap up warm! Easy to walk to from the city centre - or on a regular bus route.",
          "We visited this lake in Januari around noon and the view was just amazing. The path is very accessible, even during winter. If you're looking for a hike that is easy to manage, not too far from the centre and accessible for all ages: go for it!",
          "We were told that this is a great place to see the Northern Lights. But the path around the lake was completely frozen, so it was very difficult to walk. Plus, we did not find too many places to sit and did not see the lights.",
          "We walked to Prestvannet from Telegrafbukta beach along the really well marked, accessible trail. Beautiful views of the surrounding mountains along the way and lots of places to stop with a flask and enjoy the outdoors. A must do free activity in Tromso.",
          "Lovely location, great for jogging or walking. Panoramic views of the surrounding area very popular with skaters and families on the frozen lake. On the occasions the aurora is visible in Tromso itself then this is an ideal spot to get up high and away from the city lights.",
          "A popular lake among locals and tourist alike. Jogging here was a great experience. Once you are done, do not forget to feed the ducks.",
          "This is a nice little lake on top of Troms\u00f8. It's also often lots of birds around the lake. And many track to go and get away from the city center and it's cars. Tho' you can never escape the airplanes that are over you almost all the time.",
          "Been here many times. I just can't get enough of it. Prestvannet is a great place to relax, jogging around the lake or picnic. On a winter, Prestvannet is a great spot to watch the Aurora Borealis.",
          "Prestvannet is a small beautiful lake in the middle of Troms\u00f8ya. In summertime it is full of birds. There is a really nice, around 2 km-long walking route around the lake.",
          "We went there during the day for a walk and decided to come back in the evening. We were so lucky as Aurora showed her beautiful green face in full blast! Amazing experience.",
          "I only discovered this after years of living here, embarrassingly. It's a beautiful little lake with a great path all around it - it is 2-3 km to walk the entire path. I sometimes bike it. On a sunny day, I highly recommend this. Lots of local birds. You can see distant",
          "Well worth a trip up the hill to Prestvannet, especially when there is a lot of snow. Enjoyed the views and the walk along the ridge on the ski path, then back into town. Wonderful views.",
          "We did a bit of research prior to our trip and went up to the lake on our first night due to the clear sky. The climb took around 20 mins from Tromso, primarily due to the frozen ground - not a difficult walk, just a bit slippery as we had not used our spikes yet. The lake area",
          "This area is used year round by locals, but it sorely needs an upgrade. The whole area around the Lake is overgrown and run down.",
          "We visited the lake to see the views, it was frozen when we visited and was being used by families for cross country skiing, linked with jogging, hiking and skiing tracks to both ends of the island it was busy on the bright Sunday we visited"

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

          "This is the place for information and advice. Staff are patient and very helpful and prepared to take time to explain everything from postage to bus transport, and of course can provide information and tour bookings. Only negative is that you take a number for information",
          "We booked our lights chase here and the staff were very friendly and helpful. There are a lot of tour company options available so they helped us narrow down our options. I'd definitely recommend visiting to see all the options available to you.",

          "The staff at the desk is quite friendly but the senior simply just wants the tourist to shut up, do some self-teaching and only speak for tours. Come on, it is an information centre, not a ticket shop!",
          "We decided to stop here first to better understand our options of things to do in Tromso. I found that the person behind the counter wasn't really volunteering ideas and you kind of needed to let her know what you wanted to do and she would book tours for us. It seemed more of a",

          "Visited the tourist information several time during our one week stay. Got an excellent service each time by the friendly and helpful staff.",
          "Easy to find near dock where Hurtigruten ship arrives. Very busy place both times we went there, but well worth the wait because staff were so helpful. Unbeknownst to us the weekend we were there was the The Arctic Race. The bus routes were changed and many roads were closed.",

          "Asked for parking recommendations ... They could have said take bus 5mins out of town and park free. Only recommendation was tunnel under town. Should.have taken taxi from airport.rather than rental car if not also going other places...",

          "The tourist information centre is a great place to book any activities & excursions and several of them use this location as a pick up point. The only issue we had was that the wait time was huge. We wanted to book a northern lights trip and we queued for 50 minutes to be served.",

          "We bought bus tickets here for the local bus back to the airport. This option is much better value than the flybussen (which we took when we arrived as it was better with our large baggage). Buying tickets from the helpful, English-speaking staff was very easy and they directed",
          "The staff at the Tromso Tourist Office really helped us to get the best out of our short visit to the city.",
          "I really felt for the staff in the tourist office - the place was heaving all day, every day. People don't seem to be prepared to do any research themselves, relying on the staff to organize their trip - many would be at the counter for 30-40 minutes, thumbing through brochures",
          "Helped us a lot. But there were a lot of people, so expect some waiting. But the staff was very helpful and pleasant.",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Finnish: Tromssa; Kven: Tromssa; Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a city in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  The city is the administrative centre of the municipality as well as the administrative centre of Troms county.  The Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland and its Bishop are based at the Troms\u00f8 Cathedral in the city.  The city is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya which sits in the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait, just off the mainland of Northern Norway.  The mainland suburb of Tromsdalen is connected to the city centre on Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel.  The suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya is connected to the city centre by the Sandnessund Bridge.\n\nThe 21.25-square-kilometre (5,250-acre) town has a population (2017) of 64,448 which gives the town a population density of 3,033 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,860/sq mi).  The city centre (on Troms\u00f8ya) has a population of 38,980.  The mainland borough of the city, Tromsdalen, has a population of 16,787 and the suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya has a population of 8,681. The most populous town north of Troms\u00f8 in Norway is Alta, with a population of 15,094 (2017), making Troms\u00f8 a very large city for this vast rural northern part of Norway.   It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). \nThe city's largest workplaces are the University of Troms\u00f8 (UiT) and University Hospital of North Norway. The Norwegian Polar Institute also has its headquarters in Troms\u00f8. The Northern Lights Observatory was established in 1928, and two companies affiliated with the Kongsberg Gruppen collect satellite data from space using the observatory. The fishing industry is very important. Norway's Norges R\u00e5fisklag and Norges sj\u00f8matr\u00e5d (seafood council) both have their headquarters in Troms\u00f8. Sparebanken Nord-Norge also has its headquarters in the city. Furthermore, \"Skatt nord\", an agency of the Norwegian Tax Administration is based here too.\nThe city is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from the word for \"island\" (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Skip the payed northernlight trips! Just check your northernlight apps and wheater app, buy a bus ticket (day ticket around 10 euro for 24 hours travel!) and go here! I hope to write some regarding nothernlight an prediction and how to photograph it on my website. Maybe you",
          "We walked to the beach from the Amelie Hotel in around 35 minutes. The path was slippery to start from the sun melting the ice and it refreezing but ok if you go carefully. Stunning views from the beach and amazing for photography. We get off the beach and walk up to the Tromso",
          "If you have a day to walk around Tromso, it is perfect place to visit. Quite a walk from a city center, but worth it. I was adviced to see sunrise here, but were too cloudy. Try your luck!",
          "An easy excursion out of Tromso city centre by bus. A peaceful and beautiful location with beech woods and mountains in the distance. Close to the University Museum as well.",

          "I stayed locally to the beach so this was a 10 min walk-the area is well managed, small bit of sandy beach and plenty of seating-in summer i can imagine it gets busy and the bbq stations full. In Winter if you have a torch head down late at night, sit on the bench in the dark",
          "Been there on 26th December and had excellent 360 degree views. Many say if clear skies in Tromso there is high chances to see Northern Lights from here.",
          "This place was recommended by one of the guides to spot the aurora after we failed to spot any the previous day. If the weather is clear and the aurora forecast is good, one could see the lights from this spot. It gives a beautiful panoramic view of the Tromsoya island, which is",
          "it's pretty much the perfect outdoor area in town. In summer, you can go grilling and maybe even swimming. In the spring, you can enjoy the sun. In the winter, the Northern Lights. If you like outdoor places, go there.",
          "We traveled in and (mostly) outside Tromso chasing the Northern Lights, but in the end Telegrafbukta Beach was the spot where we saw it multiple times in all of it's glory.",
          "On clear nights the northern lights can be seen from this beach. We didn't have great forecasts when we were in Tromso so decided to visit during the day instead and chase the lights with a tour instead. It's a great walk around the beach with breathtaking views. The snow",
          "This place is the best place to see the lights if you dont want to do a tour and just want to stay local to the city. We saw them from this beach 3 of the 4 nights we stayed last night being too cloudy. There is not a lot of light pollution around so makes it ideal. I didnt have",
          "We decided to walk from twon to the Telegraphbutka to see if we could spot the Northern Lights. Unfortunately they were not out and we were ill prepared - not enough warm clothing. I have heard this is the place to go to spot the lights (when they are out).",
          "This is a very nice area to go hiking even with strollers or wheelchairs, for a picnic on the beach, have a barbecue, play volleyball/beach ball, let the kids play outdoors, or enjoy nice concerts outdoors during the right festival season. The trails are nice, in serene",
          "All norwegians come here for doing bbq, swimming, sitting with friends, playing what so ever beach games. Bring all your stuff because there is no bar etc. To the good standards, everyone takes rubbish back home. Picknick tables present. Huge beautiful vieuw also!",
          "Fantastic concert arena. Bukta.no has booking details. Great way to experience northern lights with great seafood and beer and music. Up and coming new bands just as if not more exciting than the headliners.",
          "Went where by feet on a rainy day, but it was sooo good. Rain is common for this region so everything looks beautiful when wet. It's about 30 min walking from city centre and offer a really great views on seaside and mountains.",
          "It is really amazing when you walk along the path near the Telegrafbukta. You can feel like you're watching one of the scenes of the movie. I stayed here for 4 days and everyday I felt this beach is superbeautiful. If you visit the Tromso, it is one of the best ways to see the",

          "Easy to get to either by walking or bus (we walked there and got a bus back). It has its own bus stop, the path to the beach is clearly signed. The beach has picnic tables and a wc. The wind is quite strong and it was significantly colder on the beach compared to the street",

          "Easy to find with a map or follow the brown cycle route signs.Incredible views and atmosphere. Can be enroute to Tromso museum. In winter time a visit here for sunset",
          "We caught the bus here from the centre of town. It is a short walk down to the beach from the bus stop. We saw the Aurora lighting up the sky - a free show! I would still recommend going on a tour to see the Aurora as we couldn't stay very long due to the freezing conditions.",
          "Sure, the Aurora is a natural phenomenon, and you cannot guarentee seeing it, but walking to this spot is an easy thing and the location offers great views over the fjords and skywards in the evenings.",
          "The views from this beach are staggeringly beautiful and it is also a good place to see northern lights. About 25 mins walk from Polaria or there is a bus which goes to the Tromso museum nearby. You can follow a lovely trail to Prestvannet lake which is also beautiful.",
          "I live in Troms\u00f8, close to Telegrafbukta, and I often go there for a walk, to see the sunset, make a bonfire in the designated area, and when the sky is clear, see the Northern Li\u01e5hts. A bus tour is still recommended, because you will get further away from the city to even more",

          "On a summer when the weather is nice, Telegrafbukta is an ideal place to relax, picnic or barbecue with friends. Only situated on the sounthern part of Troms\u00f8. You can get there by bus, bike or car.",
          "This is a wonderful beach and park through the year (of course with different aspects at different seasons). Especially on summertime it is very popular place for picnic and swimming. There is also a very nice walking route along the shore.",
          "This is the perfect place for the (rare) sunny day in Troms\u00f8, especially if the temperature is above 10 degrees C. It's a great beach, plus volleyball and other workout apparatus. You can even wade in the cold water, or if you're crazy enough, go all the way under for a few",
          "In mid March, we say the aurora from here in 3 out of 4 nights. One night we had clear sky and the view was awesome. The view was better than the one we got with the Aurora tour. The other nights didn't have such good weather but when the clouds were gone the aurora was visible."

          "From start to finish the activity was well executed. The guide on the coach at the pick up point was friendly and informative. The journey out to the activity was not long about 30 minutes. When we arrived we were greeted by the guides taking the activity. Our guide was called",
          "My husband and I wanted to have an arctic experience and this did not disappoint. The bus drive out was fairly easy and the dogs were excited to meet us. Yes, I won't lie, seeing the dogs little houses was startling but once our guide Joanna explained how the camp was set up",
          "I've always had dogs in my life. I did this tour last week and now I'm reflecting on it. In a country that claims to be civilized it is hard to understand what I saw. I arrived at the place very early. all dogs barked desperately. It was still dark and cold and the ground",

          "We had a wonderful time mushing our own team of dogs. We learned from experience that it's a lot harder than it looks! We really enjoyed spending time with the dogs before and afterwards. You can tell the dogs truly enjoy pulling the sled as well. It was a great time.",

          "Absolutely one of the best experiences of my life! The dogs are well-taken care of, but they are WORKING dogs, so they aren't spoiled like pet dogs and live in dog houses. However, no fleas, shiny eyes, and a soft coat, so you know they are cared for. The dogs are also SO",

          "I definitely feel like I hit the jackpot with my trip today as I was lucky enough to ride in the front sled given me unrestricted views of everything around me and even luckier I had Tove herself driving my sled with her team of Racing Dogs! I had an absolutely brilliant ride",
          "We were a little concerned we'd miss our tour, as our cruise ship arrived late. Thankfully they handled the situation extremely professionally and waited for the many cruise ship passengers that had booked the tour. My son and I absolutely loved this trip. Petting he husky pups",

          "We arrived on a cruise and were very late. But they had thankfully waited for us in Troms\u00f8 as most of the people going on the trip were from the ship. The dog sledding was the most wonderful experience. We loved every minute. Holding the puppies and petting the huskies was",
          "We had a great time. It's an amazing experience. We would recommend to anyone. The staff is great as well.",

          "This was our favourite tour during our stay in Tromso. We chose the option to drive the sled ourselves and we took it in turns, changing over at the half way point. The training for driving the sled takes only a few minutes and we found that the huskies knew exactly what to do,",
          "We did the dog sledding tour and was in general a good experience. They run this tour a few times in the day (2-4 times maybe), each sled carries 2 persons + the musher (driver) and ours was pulled by 10 dogs. In a group of around 10 sleds, we ride in a circuit with nice views",
          "Was not sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. We were well looked after and the staff made us feel very welcome. Great fun 'driving' the sled and not enough words I can say about the dogs. Truly awesome experience. The food after the event was also really nice.",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Finnish: Tromssa; Kven: Tromssa; Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a city in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  The city is the administrative centre of the municipality as well as the administrative centre of Troms county.  The Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland and its Bishop are based at the Troms\u00f8 Cathedral in the city.  The city is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya which sits in the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait, just off the mainland of Northern Norway.  The mainland suburb of Tromsdalen is connected to the city centre on Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel.  The suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya is connected to the city centre by the Sandnessund Bridge.\n\nThe 21.25-square-kilometre (5,250-acre) town has a population (2017) of 64,448 which gives the town a population density of 3,033 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,860/sq mi).  The city centre (on Troms\u00f8ya) has a population of 38,980.  The mainland borough of the city, Tromsdalen, has a population of 16,787 and the suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya has a population of 8,681. The most populous town north of Troms\u00f8 in Norway is Alta, with a population of 15,094 (2017), making Troms\u00f8 a very large city for this vast rural northern part of Norway.   It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). \nThe city's largest workplaces are the University of Troms\u00f8 (UiT) and University Hospital of North Norway. The Norwegian Polar Institute also has its headquarters in Troms\u00f8. The Northern Lights Observatory was established in 1928, and two companies affiliated with the Kongsberg Gruppen collect satellite data from space using the observatory. The fishing industry is very important. Norway's Norges R\u00e5fisklag and Norges sj\u00f8matr\u00e5d (seafood council) both have their headquarters in Troms\u00f8. Sparebanken Nord-Norge also has its headquarters in the city. Furthermore, \"Skatt nord\", an agency of the Norwegian Tax Administration is based here too.\nThe city is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from the word for \"island\" (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The staff at the desk is quite friendly but the senior simply just wants the tourist to shut up, do some self-teaching and only speak for tours. Come on, it is an information centre, not a ticket shop!",

          "Visited the tourist information several time during our one week stay. Got an excellent service each time by the friendly and helpful staff.",
          "Easy to find near dock where Hurtigruten ship arrives. Very busy place both times we went there, but well worth the wait because staff were so helpful. Unbeknownst to us the weekend we were there was the The Arctic Race. The bus routes were changed and many roads were closed.",

          "Asked for parking recommendations ... They could have said take bus 5mins out of town and park free. Only recommendation was tunnel under town. Should.have taken taxi from airport.rather than rental car if not also going other places...",

        "wiki": "Tromsdalen (Northern Sami: Romssav\u00e1ggi or S\u00e1la\u0161v\u00e1ggi) is an urban neighborhood in the city of Troms\u00f8 which is in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  It is located just to the east of the city centre on the mainland along the coast of the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait.   The 5.01-square-kilometre (1,240-acre) urban area has a population (2017) of 16,787 which gives it a population density of 3,351 inhabitants per square kilometre (8,680/sq mi).\n\nThe urban area encompasses a good portion of the valley in which it is located.  Tromsdalen, which literally means Troms valley, is connected to the island of Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge. The European route E8 highway runs through the northern part of Tromsdalen. The Tromsdalselva river flows through the valley.  The Arctic Cathedral is located here.\nPopular attractions in Tromsdalen are the Arctic Cathedral and the Fjellheisen aerial tramway to the top of a nearby fell; the tramway ends at an elevation of 420 metres (1,380 ft) where the view is stunning.  The mountain Tromsdalstinden is located at the eastern end of Tromsdalen and reaches an elevation of 1,238 metres (4,062 ft).  The climb to the top of this mountain is very popular with the Troms\u00f8 residents, since mountain climbing equipment is not needed.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. The church overlooks the town and is impressive on the hill and can be seen from all over but inside it is just average. There was a big organ that someone was playing but I was disappointed there just wasn't more to this",
          "This striking building dominates the skyline of Tromso, more so because it is in a residential area and on a ridge overlooking the harbour. The architecture is the attraction and the story of it's construction is very interesting. it is an absolute must-do if in Tromso, in fact",
          "One of the places to visit in Tromso, especially due to the exterior somewhat resembling Sydney Opera House, but underwhelming in the interior compared to most European churches. Cost was about $6 per adult with no senior discounts available. Credit cards taken. No brochure",
          "Our visit to the Arctic Cathedral was near midnight on a long frigid arctic night. Had it been just to see the building, I would have been disappointed. The word Cathedral does not have the same significance in the Norwegian Church that it holds for Catholic or Anglican",

          "Interesting to see at night from afar. Not worth paying 50 nok to go inside. I wouldn\u2019t even make it a stop at all if it wasn\u2019t on the way to the cable car. There are magnificent churches all around the world for free - very disappointing.",

          "As others have said, from the outside this church is beautiful, a great spectacle and well worth seeing. The walk across the bridge is nice and seeing the church appear larger as you approach is amazing. However it is expensive to go inside ( 50 NOK , approx \u00a34.50) and we took",

          "This is one of the main attractions of Tromso but the architecture is great only if you look at it from outside. We stayed in the center of Tromso so we walked on the bridge which connects the Tromso island with the area where the cathedral and cable car are. We did not enter",

          "Best to go here on the way to Fjellheisen as it is on the same bus route. It is also possible to walk from the city centre, but it will take around 20+ minutes and the wind can be quite strong while crossing the bridge. Need to pay if you want to go inside the cathedral itself.",
          "We have decided to see the cathedral before leaving, as it was a quick road from our accommodation - we did not regret! If you get to see it at night it is even better!",

          "If it hadn\u2019t been my 60th birthday, I might not have paid such a steep price (app. $50 for two tickets) for a concert that lasts just 30 minutes. But I wanted to end the day with something special, and this did turn out to be a lovely concert. An enchanting combination of",
          "The cathedral is quite nice but extremely underwhelming and, in my opinion, not worth the entrance fee if there is no concert going on. We went in, spent probably 10 minutes looking a the stained glass and then left.",
          "We visited here for the midnight concert arranged by hurtigruten, what a beautiful evening. It is an amazing structure being such an unusual shape, the acoustics are fantastic, perfect for the organist, pianist, saxophonist and singer to perform in. A great place to visit even",
          "I don't like churches where I have to pay an entry fee - and in this case we did pay. It was not worth paying 50 NOK to enter the church, you can see the altar through the window - you don't see much more when you are inside.",
          "Lovely Cathedral with a very impressive stained glass window. The Cathedral is spectacularly light up at night.",
          "This building is very iconic from outside, and it is really simple inside. It is nice to see and located in a great place, with nice views over Troms\u00f8. Worth the visit for the views, maybe not for the building itself",
          "Beautiful building and fun to take pictures of the outside. Inside looking quite boring through the glass, but I was quickly told that I had to pay the entrance fee if I wanted to take pictures of the inside, with a long lecture about that I should have known as it is clearly",
          "Very unusual and striking cathedral... but would not pay to go. I was hoping there would be more information about the cathedral but I didn't find anything. Very modern and minimalistic, not much to see. Was in and out in 5 minutes pretty much.",
          "Visited during city tour of Tromso with Hurtigruten Cruise. Beautiful from a distance, and surrounded by snow, just after sunset. Views across to the city spectacular. Lovely West End stained glass window. Better from the outside, than the interior",
          "50 nok to visit the church. Not worth the money to be honest , but beautiful architecture nonetheless . Tourist trap.",
          "I was there for listening the Norther lights concert. It was absolutely stunning. The place is so unique, quiet and simple but enlightened.I would definitely go again.",
          "Religion is supposed to be about faith, but when you have to pay 5\u20ac to pay your respects, the business underlying comes up. Half an hour walk over the bridge for this disappointment.",
          "Costs nk50 for 2 mins inside. Better off to just view from outside easy to walk from Troms\u00f8 20mins over the bridge",
          "Beautiful place for a stopover. Not much to do for the price. You can sit for a while, or take some photos. There\u2019s nothing that explains the history or background unless you sneak read a book in the gift shop. We stayed 20 minutes and that was plenty.",
          "We came here and it is a beautiful cathedral. Very open and bright, this is a magical place to come and sit as well.",
          "It definitely stands out as the architecture is very different in comparison to the other buildings around. The interiors are modern but have seen better interiors and its smaller than you would expect.",
          "best view of stained glass is from outside & this gives the best appreciation of the window. very plain interior but very atmospheric.",
          "Had to make two trips to the cathedral to go inside, since it is not open in the morning. Its interior did not move me a bit, Vast, imponent, but cold. A smaller old catholic church in the town center has a much more involving atmosphere.",
          "A wonderful, modern building - its architecture reflecting modern Scandinavia and the surrounding landscape. Visited in the daytime AND at midnight for a concert. Fabulous!",
          "If most of Tromso is on the west side of the water, this is on the east of the water. I walked across the bridge in the pouring rain. it takes about 20 minutes from the centre of town to here Was it worth it? yes and no. Even from a distance, you can see it is a beautiful",
          "We walked across the bridge to see this cathedral but it was closed and not much to look at through the windows. Concert nights are held here but not worth a special trip to visit.",
          "Would not recommend this as a must. Looks way better from outside. Not worth paying for to enter. Could also be the lack of natural light.",
          "Nicknamed a cathedral, but it's actually a church - and a rather beautiful one at that. I loved the way the light enters through the side windows on even a dull day. NB costs to get in...",
          "This church is separated from most of the town by a bridge over the fiord. Despite its modern concrete design it looks very attractive when lit up at night. Didn\u2019t go to the midnight concert as we felt it was too expensive but friends who did said it was lovely.p",
          "It is wonderful to visit to see this unusual looking work church. Make sure you check timings before visiting, because it\u2019s has wedding etc .... so sometimes closed.",
          "Beautiful stained glass window. Small. Looks great from the outside. Nice during cold weather \ud83d\ude09. You can get there by walking through the bridge or take a bus (50 nok one way!)",
          "Took a walk over the bridge from our hotel to get a closer look to this outstanding building. Certainly a defining landmark in Tromso",
          "Aside the architecture, which is quite interesting, nothing much to see. Do come in the evening when it is all liteen up.",
          "Popular site, good to stop off for a few pictures after a walk across the bridge on the way to the cable car. We didn\u2019t go inside",
          "The Artic Cathedral is very easy to spot from Tromso and the locals were telling us about it saying it was worth a visit and it definitely was! It was really cheap to get in as it is a \u00a35 donation to go towards the up keep of the cathedral and the stain glass window, the organ",
          "Overlooking the bridge leading to the old town of Trams\u00f8 this beautiful church deserves a quaick visit if you walk to the Cable Car from the Troms\u00f8 Old Town.",
          "It's a different and nice cathedral. Good place to sit down for 15 minutes and discover details in the fantastic glass mosaic. One thing I would not do again is walk across the bridge. So much airpollution and noise. Take the bus back to town.",
          "It is well worth the approximately 1km walk over the bridge to visit the Arctic cathedral, a modern yet inspiring church, both inside and out, with the stain glass windows a particular feature. But perhaps the highlight is to attend a midnight concert. The timing is set to",
          "It is a modern piece of architecture inspired from the surrounding landscape. When we visited in winter it was snow covered everywhere so was postcard like beautiful. Interiors was expectedly modern. there is a small entry fee.",
          "There's is an entrance fee of 50NOK. Oslo city has great church and its free. If u are into church you may pay the money and look inside. There's window for u to see through also to see what's inside the church. Other than that its great to take pic from outside.",
          "This isn't really a cathedral, but is an interesting focal point for the community. All types of concerts are held there as well as meetings and such as well as church services regularly. The stained glass is quite beautiful.",
          "We would skip this one. Was not much to see. They charged to enter and it is really just a very average church.",
          "Beautiful architecture and very unique. Shame it was closed but nevertheless worth seeing it from the outside.",
          "This was the sole reason I paid huge sums of money to go on the Hurtigruten Tromso city tour; it was dark and there had been a heavy snow fall, so it seemed easier to be taken there in a bus. In all honesty, the 20 minutes we were allocated was plenty. It was so beautiful and",
          "Pay in entrance. Its enough to see it from the outside.. nothing special inside unless you wanna light a candle",
          "Looks pretty from the outside, short opening times and not a lot to do when inside. The architecture is stunning, it looks 100 times better at night due to being lit up, also a good view over the bridge to Tromso.",
          "Worshiper's get in free and the rest of us have to pay 50 NOK. Not worth the money. Looked through the window and made my way to the cable car.",
          "We were lucky enough to attend a midnight service at this cathedral. The acoustics and atmosphere were fantastic as we listened to Norwegian classical music and folk songs.",
          "We didn\u2019t find anything interesting, you can take the pictures from outside with no need to spend de 50 NOK fee entrance.",
          "Walking distance from the centrum of Troms\u00f8 around 2.2 km. Very nice walk over the bridge. Cathedral itself nothing special, was closed for visitors, architecture very simple and for me to easy and too basic to say wow. Looking inside through the window the same feeling,",
          "Photograph it front side from the bridge. Photo of the rear stained glass is nice when it's dark. Could not see the point of paying the entrance fee when you can see in through the window.",
          "Since we have read reviews about there is nothing to see inside (and what more you have to pay an entrance fee) we decided just to stop by while walking from the inland to island. It is worth to see it but in my opinion it still looks better from the distance.",
          "This cathedral can be reached by bus from the main city in just about 5-10 minutes and is worth a visit.",
          "Very nice hill side church great build and shall look good for day and night photos. Only find entrance fee is bit dear",
          "Not worth it to go in! Architecture amazing structure... Beautiful views from outside. Inside boring .. Not much else to say. Stained glass window only visible with colors from outside structure",
          "Located at the end of the bridge when you come from city center to the residential area, it\u2019s a wonderful construction that totally deserves some minutes to admire. On the other hand I could not say the same about the interior. Nothing special or on my taste.",
          "We walked to the cathedral feom downtown, over the bridge. The church is nice but having to pay to go inside was disappointing.",
          "Stunning landmark, do not miss. We walked across the bridge to see it up close and take photos from the outside. We weren't able to attend a concert inside cathedral during our visit, but I would definitely have done it if I'd known about the show in time.",
          "Visit to the Arctic Cathedral was a natural place of visit in Tromso. We took a 15-20 mins walk from the City Centre and crosses the bridge of Tromso. Arctic Cathedral is situated nearer to the residential part of Tromso. As Tromso is a small place, Arctic Cathedral became a",
          "We tried to visit during regular visit hours (13:00-18:00) but found 50 NOK entrance fee a bit too expensive.",
          "We actually went indoors during the day, but the best view is after dark when it's all lit up. A good stop on a walk back from the cable car towards Tromso.",
          "During our trip on the Hurtigruten ship Polarys one of the excursions was to a midnight concert at the Arctic Cathedral. This is a great chance to see this beautiful cathedral. The concert lasted 30 minutes with a soloist, saxophonist and a pianist. The acoustics are said to",
          "As per title . It's 50 kroner each to visit and really should be donation only . It's small ,for a cathedral, and quirky,but that's it .",
          "Waiting for 3 hours, nothing happened. We were cold and hungry, decided to give up. While we were waiting at the bus stop, kP index suddenly rise and some aurora explosion happened.",
          "It's architecture was quite impressive. Tall triangular structure, well constructed. It's on a height and the view from here is excellent. The bridge connecting Tromso Island and mainland looks quite excellent. Quite a photogenic spot and we clicked lots of photos here. On",
          "We visited during our 4 day break. It\u2019s a nice spot to see but costs 50nok to get in (c\u00a35) per person. It\u2019s a beautiful building but we didn\u2019t pay to go inside as you can see through the windows at the front.",
          "This is an icon of the city. Even if you stop by for a minute, it\u2019s a wonderful place to visit. Concerts inside. Check the local schedules.",
          "Such an amazing design. The stained glass window is just beautiful and the the building itself so worth visiting.",
          "One of the few actual \"sites\" in Tromso to see. It's a cool walk across the bridge from town and looks great in pictures and from the outside. Very small and not much to see other than the one big stained glass window inside. Really wasn't worth the cost of admission unless you",
          "Modern exterior and interior, little cold atmosphere but still nice to see since there is the only Cathedral built at this latitude (350km northern to Polar Circle)",
          "We walked across Troms\u00f8 bridge during the day to the Cathedral, we didn't go in at this point, but we did have tickets for a New Year's Eve concert, which we had purchased online about a month prior to going. The concert lasted approx. 1 hour and consisted of some Sami folk",
          "You have to pay to go inside, even as a student or resident. The outside is more interesting and the Troms\u00f8 Domkirke on the island is better inside for a more historical and religious vibe.",
          "We visited the cathedral on 23/12 . We were impressed by the look of the building and although the inside was stunning - there wasn\u2019t any information about the cathedral unless you purchased a book. But we had the good fortune to hear a Norwegian singer and his band warming up",
          "It is one of the postcards of the city and its simple modern architecture is so beautiful looking from far or near. The only disappointment I had, was because when I visited (on Christmas days) it was closed for visitation (which I understand as contraditorio).",
          "This is a beautiful piece of architecture. It is simple and elegant. Being the church once you are inside you can experience the serenity. Really great Stained Glass work",
          "On our first visit we only walked around the outside which is incredibly beautiful! But when we returned this year we managed to fit in a proper visit; and despite being busy, we still found the Arctic Cathedral to be a very peaceful place. There is a tranquility and beauty that",
          "Definitely worth a visit for the beautiful architecture. There was a minimal fee to go inside as well.",
          "Beautiful way to finish 2018 and get inspired to start 2019. This was the concert at the Cathedral. Arctic Cathedral is very interesting in Troms\u00f8. Modern and full of light.",
          "The design of the cathedral is just beautifulboth from the outside and inside as well. Check out the stained glass and walk all the way round. It's a great spot for taking photographs of Tromso and the fjords.",
          "It\u2019s a usual church. The outside structure is very unique for photos, but nothing else to see inside.",
          "The architecture of this church is quite unusual, and it has a nice lighting installation, as was noted by other people here. However, all of this is not that special and not really worth the walk, and especially not worth the entry fee.",
          "We went to cathedral ticket booth to peer inside and it didn't appear to be worth it. When discussing with the staff what there was to see, she suggested it would probably be worth it in the summer months but not during winter when there is no sun coming through the windows.",
          "Great architecture. The cathedral is next to the Tromso bridge, really a landmark.The inside is spectacular!",
          "Just like the title, one of the reasons we wanted to come and visit Tromso was because I really want to see this magnificent Arctic Cathedral. It is as beautiful as how it\u2019s photographed in the photos you probably see on the internet. Stunning.",
          "Interesting for architecture lovers and a beautiful subject from the outside for the photographers. We didn't got the chance to see the sun rises through the strained glass window but we found it beautifull anyway. Not much to doo but if you are lucky you can catch a Christmas",
          "When the cathedral is open, the lights are on and the huge stained glass window glows. That plus the architecture is what you\u2019ll most enjoy seeing. We paid the steep 5NOK to go inside and regretted that, though it was a donation to the church. I\u2019d suggest you skip that and just",
          "This is a pretty sight looking across the water from Tromso. Not sure it is worth the view up close, or going in. The hours for entry are also a bit unpredictable and don't necessarily match the website if booked for a private function.",
          "This wonderful unmistakable landmark of Tromso is located facing the sea and town centre. You can walk from the hurtigruten terminal and hotels across. It takes about 25 minutes to walk. The design is stunning. Open from 1400 to 1800 during winter with services behind held",
          "50 NRK for visiting the church. Watch it from the outside - there is NOTHING inside - you can't se through the windows. Best seen in the night - with the lights and and the beautiful windows at the back",
          "It's ok. A bit interesting, but nothing special. We didn't really get the chance to see the interior because there's a Sunday service going on and we couldn't wait since it was so cold outside. However, it is a great vantage point to take some photos and we were lucky the sky",
          "The cathedral is an amazing building situated at a quiet neighborhood just across the city center. We took the bus 28 thats two way return. There was a service going on so we didn't want to go in to disturb them. Took some nice pictures and the walked to the nearby cable car",
          "Took the 30 min walk in cold morning winter (minus 5 degree C) to enjoy the views and feel the winter of Troms\u00f8. Iconic Arctic Cathedral is good for pictures and also for taking the harbour and mountains. Great views but layer up as with the strong will temperatures will go",
          "I walked to the Chapel from the cruise ship area. I enjoyed walking over the bridge, but that might be too much for someone who is not used to walking or if you have limited time. There was an entrance fee. The cathedral is beautiful inside and out.",
          "As with most Scandinavian countries, I found this church to be a departure from the normal shape and architecture of the churches found elsewhere. Its located right at the end of the Tromso bridge and you get good views of the city as well the bridge from the church.",
          "Beautiful church, but you actually get the most out of your visit by an outside view. Might be otherwise in the summertime though, when you get light from the outside.",
          "This was a really beautiful experience. We attended the Arctic Cathedral Midnight Concert and it was wonderful. The cathedral has excellent acoustics and the singers performances were delightful. Would recommend anyone to make the effort to get to the concert. Well worth a visit.",
          "Easy to walk to across bridge from city centre. In winter it is lit up and looks outstanding against the darkness of the winter skies. Steep concrete sides are interleaved with glass panels bringing lots of light into the church and highlighting the beautiful stain glass window",
          "A wonderful musical experience at midnight. this beautiful warm modern cathedral has the most amazing acoustics, no microphones were needed at all.",
          "This icon of Troms\u00f8 is worth a visit. Walk across the bridge from the town centre, or ride a bus for a couple of stops. An active cultural venue, the church hosts hundreds of concerts each year. Its midnight concerts in the summer and northern light concerts in the winter are",
          "We were on the Hurtigruten tour and chose the option to attend a midnight concert in this very modern cathedral. The stained glass window over the altar is rich in colour and design. The concert was excellent. The performers (3) used the accoustics in a great manner,",
          "So we decided to walk to the Arctic Cathedral across the bridge, which should take about 20 mins but we probably took longer due to the awesome views we kept stopping to check out! The cathedral itself reminded me Toblerone, it was definitely unique in style and while simple on",
          "The 30 minute walk over the bridge to the arctic cathedral was totally worth it. You not only get amazing views of the city and cathedral from the bridge but also get to see a beautiful sky colors if timed well (we went around 11 am). The architecture is amazing. We didnt get to",
          "A must see iconic land mark of Tromso, a culture deeply religious (mostly protestant). I also highly recommend some education in relation to the Sami people.",
          "Firstly we never planned to visit the cathedral but happened to pass it on route to the cable car. From a distance the building looks impressive, even more so when lit up. As we walked across the bridge the church is directly in front of you. It is very easy to spot on the",
          "The church has a striking appearance from the outside however they charge 50kr pp for entry and it is deeply underwhelming. I\u2019m always against churches charging admission, but this one isn\u2019t even nice inside. Even the stained glass window on the back of the church was better",
          "We saw the cathedral when it was dark and that was 3pm in the afternoon. All lit up it on a hill,overlooking Troms\u00f8 looks pretty spectacular. The cost to go in was around 59nok. A modern church inside not a traditional one with statues of saints etc. Its fairly plain with what",
          "It's Lovely to see it at night, it's so shiny but we don't enter inside. Its a really nice views from there",
          "The cathedral is spectacular from the outside and when viewed from a distance lit up. The stained glass window is nice. However we didn\u2019t pay the 50NOK entry fee as you could see through the windows. Worth a visit but don\u2019t allow too long to see it.",
          "We walked from our hotel at Clarion hotel The edge to this Cathedral and it took around 30 minutes walking across the bridge. We thought it opens at 1 pm but when we arrived we discovered it opens at 2 pm in November. It looks modern and different.",
          "A modern cathedral, this is situated opposite the main town, you can walk across a bridge to get there or catch the bus - check the opening times though as they vary by season. The stained glass window is fantastic, the cathedral is quite minimalistic but is also very pretty",
          "We made a last minute choice to visit the cathedral for a midnight concert. The acoustics were amazing. What we could see if the architecture was interesting although we couldn\u2019t appreciate the huge stained glass window due to lack of light",
          "Apparently some dude recording a music video is more important than the dozens of tourists waiting outside in the cold. The exact length of the delay mentioned on the note was also very helpful.",
          "It's a very nice Cathedral, specially when the lights are turn on but there is still some mild sunshine that allows you to still see the landscape behind. On night time, even when you don't get to see the landscape, the view is still amazing. In all honesty, the exterior is much",
          "Cruise port of call. Beautiful architecture, couldn't see inside because there was a funeral taking place.",
          "It\u2019s a very beautiful Cathedral with modern architecture. It can be reached from the city center by walking or by taking a bus. Bus stop is just in front of the cathedral. For bus fare pp it was 50 kroner for 1&1/2 hrs, chk it with the bus driver once u get into the bus u can",
          "My partner and I visited the cathedral after seeing it all lit up from our hotel across the other side of the water. It's a really beautiful building from the outside and is designed to look like an iceberg which is pretty cool. It's 50 NOK each to enter but unfortunately when",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is an imposing landmark on the opposite side of the bridge to Tromso. We walked across the bridge on a very cold day but it was worth it for the views and for the church itself. There was a small charge to get in but it is worth it. If you are in Tromso",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is in Tromso Norway but on the opposite side of the bridge to town centre of Tromso. From the town centre of Tromso it is a spectacular walk across the Tromso bridge to the cathedral which sits at the foot of the mountains. The cathedral was built in 1965",
          "The church is very easy to find as it is located on a small hill overlooking the town. It's a very modern, large and open space.",
          "We first spotted this from the window in our hotel room. It was intriguing during the day with the exquisite stained glass windows, but when we viewed it up close shining at night it was more spectacular.",
          "This church is pretty but you don't stay long. If we hadn't got free entrance using out Tromso Pass I am not sure we would have made the trip but nonetheless it was nice to go.",
          "this is well worth seeing - it is a beautiful cathedral and/or church with lovely glass stained windows",
          "Striking building but probably more interesting from the outside than inside. There's a 50nok entry free",
          "You can see it afar from the city centre. Went closer, it looks the same except nearer. I guess it is the one of the landmark in Tromso. Chose not to go in as you can peep through the glasses.",
          "walked to the arctic cathedral but it was closed so i didn't manage to go in. i think it opens at ? 3pm only. anyway u can peer in their windows, nothing very spectacular. it's nice to take pix outside though! proceeded to the cable car station after this!",
          "My wife and I, along with my wife's parents, visited the Arctic Cathedral during our recent 2 night visit to Tromso. We walked across the bridge from downtown Tromso and the entire walk took us about 20-25 minutes on a clear but windy day. The walk itself isn't difficult but",
          "Picture prior to visit made it seem more then it is. Looks great from a distance at night. Not so much up close during the day. It what it is.",
          "I have given 1 for the stain glass window. Was it worth the 10 NOK to see it? No. Just a modern church inside which took me about 30 seconds to see. If I was a spiritual person maybe it would have been different but when I compare it to some of the magnificent cathedrals of",
          "A beautiful cathedral and well worth the viist. If it is not windy walk over the bridge from the city and this is an experience in itself and nice to arrive at the cathedral.",
          "It was a good walk from the Tromso island up the bridge and back. The cathedral is modern, different, serene and of course, has great views, from outside and within.",
          "My husband and I went here because I was interested to see the Cathedral up close. It was really nice from the outside. If you want to enter, you have to pay. We paid 100 (?) NOK for both of us if I remember correctly in order to enter. The inside was nice, but if you are not",
          "We were lucky enough to enjoy a midnight concert in the Arctic Cathederal in Tromso. Visually stunning building inside and out. We enjoyed perfect sound reverberating through the triangular structure. A male vocalist accompanied by a flute player and a pianist using his big",
          "Worth a quick visit to see the beautiful stained glass window behind the altar. Take the bus from the city centre and walk back across the bridge for a great view of the sound.",
          "Check timings before you go. We waited until they opened after doing the cable car tour. Once inside, you pay for admission and church is small enough to look around for no more than 1/2 hr, unless you wanted to stay longer for private prayers. I imagine would be spectacular if",
          "Interesting architecture but little else to recommend about a visit. Probably much better to visit for a concert or church services. A band was doing a sound check for a concert of Christmas music that evening while we were there, and the acoustics were impressive.",
          "It is a beautiful building and the organ plays wonderful music. Not really worth the price and not much to see inside. Would only do if the weather is bad outside.",
          "The trip across the river from the island to the church across that amazing bridge was as much a part of the journey The church was closed when we were there but hey, we took some cool photos of the church and the scenes from the bridge",
          "Worth a visit to this most Northern of churches. Beautiful setting overlooking the water. Highly recommended.",
          "We took a walk to see the Cathedral and it was closed the view was very nice from the front. Be sure to check ahead and see if the building is open before you go.",
          "It is a beautiful place of worship located at a nice location. Serene place to be one with yourself. Beautiful pictures of our mother Earth in the gallery.",
          "It was a beautiful sunny day perfect for a visit. We arrived just after a service (it looked like a baptism) with a young baby girl the centre of attention. The church is stunning outside as is the inside. Don\u2019t just look towards the alter turn back and look up and see one",
          "This is a beautiful modern cathedral with stunning architecture inside and out. We were particularly impressed with the huge, artistic stained glass.",
          "In Norwegian its called Ice Ocean Cathedral and of course with the shape and the surface of the building you know and feel you are in the Arctic! But, don't forget to take a peek - at least - inside and you will have a nice, warm and color adventures from the both ends (looking",
          "While visiting some relatives in Tromso they took us to see the Arctic Cathedral Also know as Ishavskatedralen (don't ask me to pronounce ii). You can see it nearly anywhere in Tromso. There is a fee (50Kr) to go inside, that was somewhat of a surprise I never had to pay a fee",
          "This cathedral should be a \u2018must do\u2019 if you are in Tromso. The apparent simplicity of design deceives you into thinking it won\u2019t be very special but walking inside I was overwhelmed by its design. The stained glass window behind the altar is stunning with the message that it",
          "We got the bus over for the concert which was easy from Tromso centre. The concert features three musicians who played and sang a variety of local, National and international music. Some of the pieces gave us both goose bumps, they were beautiful. We were then incredibly",
          "This easy to get to church has amazing acoustics and a nice pipe organ. The stained glass is quite nice, and the seats are very comfortable.",
          "Interesting architecture but I guess looking a bit like an iceberg when you are above the Arctic Circle makes sense.",
          "This is a beautiful building that you don't see every day, being a church and not being religious I did not want to spend the 50 nok requested to visit it, so I did look only the outside. The architecture is beautiful and particular, and it has been built on a nice view point in",
          "Cathedral is a strong word that evokes certain images in one's mind. This does not match those expectations, bit is still very nice. It's a simple construction, as often described, with nothing too notable about it. The stain glass added behind the altar was put in against the",
          "We visited the cathedral during the day and found it to be pretty and fairly simple compared to many European cathedrals. This may be in part to how far north it s (small population) and that the Germans burned a lot of N. Norway to the ground in 1944. Still it is a pretty",
          "Wife and I stopped by. They charge a fee of 50Kr which was a bit of a surprise. Decent crowd at 10 am",
          "Never experienced before, church charching an entry fee. Excellent location and looks beautiful from the other side in the evening light.",
          "You need to purchase a ticket to go inside.. The fee is about $6 US there is not much to see inside, only the chadelier which is like a large icicle and the stained glass. You can see it from the outside thru a window.",
          "From our Hurtigruten ship we took a bus to this lovely church to hear a midnight concert. It was worth staying up for.",
          "We only viewed it from the outside, as you had to pay to get in. The outside was beautiful, even in gray weather.",
          "Nothing about this cathedral is worth visiting, its literally one small hall and nothing special about the architecture or design. Just takes pictures from the outside that\u2019s probably all you need. Again, do not waste your money, the picture attached is all you gonna see inside",
          "Worth visiting because of its unusual triangular design and simplicity which makes it unexpectedly beautiful. A charming view of Tromso and the bridge leading to it from its elevated entrance.",
          "We had wanted to attend to attend the midnight sun concert but it was sold out so we just stoped by to see the inside. It is a simple church with interesting architecture and a beautiful stain-glass window. I do find it interesting that many of the Scandinavian churches charge",
          "The organ and violin performance makes the entrance fee worth the money. It was beautiful. If you don\u2019t like classical music. From the outside you can also make wonderful pictures. The architecture is interesting.",
          "I went to a midnight concert in this beautiful cathedral which was absolutely amazing and highly recommended. I walked across the bridge which seemed a really long walk and then the Arctic Cathedral appeared at the end of the bridge,surrounded by mist.",
          "Seems to be a constant stream of visitors walking over the bridge or being dropped off by coaches when the cruise ships are in. You get great views of tromso when walking over the bridge but I wouldn\u2019t waste your money to enter the cathedral. You can see what\u2019s inside by looking",
          "OK, the modern design when viewed across the water from the main part of Tromso City is quite eye catching and, as you approach it on foot, it stands out against the green background of the surrounding hills. However, internally it is a little underwhelming apart from the one",
          "A mid 20th century church with great vistas and a powerful modern organ. Unless you are interested in modern architecture it is probably not worth making a special trip to see the Church BUT if you can arrange your visit to coincide with the 14:00hrs daily organ recital it is",
          "We could see the Cathedral easily from Troms\u00f8, and resolved to visit it during our stay in Troms\u00f8. We walked across Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the view of the Cathedral close up was even more impressive. Although we didn't go inside the Cathedral (a Service was on at the time) we walked",
          "You need to visit Ishavskatedralen. It is an amazing building and why not attend the Sunday service. It is conducted in Norwegian but easy to follow and enjoy.",
          "Visited as part of Globus tour.Globus paid for us to see this??? Majority of group 42 passengers cannot understand what you pay for?",
          "Beautifully designed on the outside, and a little disappointing inside. The midnight concert was wonderful.",
          "It is nice. It is scenic. Nothing negative to say about it. But without the context of a church with modern architecture next to a beautiful waterway across from a glittering island city linked by a gracefully arched cantilever bridge, it might not quite rank in the top ten of",
          "The Artic Cathedral stands out among all the small houses nearby, close to the shore of the Tromso fjord. It is a modern church with a large white cross inside the tepee-like construction. As it is modern church the interior is austere, but the stained glass shines and brings",
          "Stopped to take a few photos of this beautiful, iconic church on our visit to Troms\u00f8 off a cruise ship. Just be careful if visiting on Sunday - the interior is closed to visitors on Sunday mornings for services, and is also sometimes closed on Sunday afternoons due to weddings.",
          "It's beautiful and when you think cathedral you think quiet, solemn-not here, not when I went. Was so crowded and chaotic. They have midnight concerts and that is probably nice I was really regretting not having stopped by before to avoid the crowd.",
          "Stands out from the distance and thats about it, expensive to enter and fairly plain inside. A lot of hype, not justified.",
          "Original church building, especially seen from the outside. A pity they ask money to visit the inside while there is not much to see that differs from any other church",
          "I went as part of a group from the Hurtigruten to a midnight concert. The building was much smaller than memory served, but was as good for acoustics as claimed. (There were only three performers, but they filled the building.) Beatific use of concrete, if you can imagine it,",
          "Beautiful architecture. In summer you should join the summer concert starting at 11pm. After the concert, you can see the sun going down and rising up again.",
          "We went as part of a tour. I paid the extra (50 NOK or $6.20)to get pictures inside. The cathedral is small but the stained glass window is beautiful. Don\u2019t miss the elevated organ at the other end of the cathedral.",
          "Hiked here from the cruise port (30 minutes) while a gale blew, only to find it closed for baptism! However, could see the stained glass window from the outside and can only surmise that it is a huge cruise ship destination because it's the only thing to see in this one horse",
          "Don\u2019t be fooled this is not an historic piece of architecture and history. Good views of the bridge and town. Inside is bland and the stained glass window saves it. Small hill to climb up and some stairs so if you have some mobility issues take care and check in advance. Our",
          "The church stands out as you view the town. The stained glass and architecture make it interesting to photo. l visited in the summer, but photos of the church with the Northern Lights are spectacular. I would definitely take the opportunity to visit If you are lucky enough to be",
          "This cathedral has interesting architecture and beautiful stained glass. If you aren\u2019t going to a concert or event, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to walk through and see everything there is to see. There is an admission fee.",
          "From our cruise ship we could see the Arctic Cathedral, architecture stunning on our trip up close just amazing. You must pay to enter 50 NOK per person I understand why BUT to pay to enter a house of God leaves me cold so I did not enter.",
          "This church, nicknamed \u201cIshavskatedralen\u201d (\"The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea\") is an amazing church. Despite the name cathedral, the church is a parish church and not, in fact, a cathedral as it is commonly called. A glass mosaic was added later, it was a wall on the place before.",
          "A small church with an interesting design. But not lots to see. Walk in, look around, look at the stained glass. That's about it. Nothing, frankly, to go out of your way for.",
          "If you arrive in Tromso via cruise ship, you'll easily recognize this prominent place of worship as it will stand out in your view of Tromso Sound. While viewing the outside of the Cathedral will give you a sense of the unique architecture, make sure you go inside to fully",
          "We were awed by the wonderful stain glass the architecture is incredible and the guide explained why it was designed with 11 arches to represent the disciples excluding Judas. It is quite expensive to go in but then everything in Norway costs more that in many more southerly",
          "We attended one of the midnight sun concerts. You can buy tickets there or online. The concert is about 30 minutes long and is wonderful. To get there from Tromso, we walked across the bridge (about a 15 minute walk with great views), but we saw buses going over there as well.",
          "Awed by the beauty and peace of the Arctic Cathedral! The architecture is fabulous and such a testament in connecting the area and religion.",
          "The church was nice, but I think the price is overrated to go inside. Churches are a place of worship and should be free of charge",
          "The Arctic Cathedral can be seen across the water from the main city area of Tromso. It is a beautiful building . A walk across the Tromso Bridge will take you to the Arctic Cathedral .",
          "Absolutely not to be missed. Quite expensive for 30mins but typical Norway and no regrets. The music was so beautiful. Enchanting.",
          "We went to a mid night concert in June so we were able to see the place in daylight. It has the appearance of several lumps of concrete propped against each other. That said it has produced excellent accoustics.",
          "If you do not have time to explore inside, take a good look from outside. The architecture is beautiful.",
          "It\u2019s expensive (50NOK per person) to visit a church and see a very nice stained glass window - A big part of which is covered by the white backdrop of the alter. The architecture is impressive but can be appreciated from outside. The staff refused to allow someone to use the",
          "Stopped briefly at the cathedral for photos. Neat architectural design. Could not go inside the see the stained glass windows because of a funeral in process.",
          "From a purely aesthetic perspective, this Parish Church displays interesting modern architecture from the outside and a beautiful mosaic stain glass appreciated inside, but not much more to take away beyond that as a visiting tourist. A little less that a mile walk from the",
          "The cathedral itself is very interesting but it's good to go there before or after mass cos then you can see locals in their typical clothing. Quite interesting",
          "We first viewed the cathedral from the dock side and wow what a sight it has truly been built to leave you in awe We walked from the dockside across the amazing bridge which is worth the walk on its own, then on to the cathedral. I was disappointed that you had to pay to go in",
          "Everyone who will visit Tromso must came to see this amazing building what is close to bridge. I like modern churches what this Arctic Catedral is.",
          "We dropped by as it was on our list of 'must do's' and certainly the modern decor and the light and airy feel is in contrast to many cathedrals. The stained glass windows behind the altar is stunning, but it is sad that the whole is no longer displayed as it is covered by a",
          "Highly recommend, Very peaceful place and you will get a perfect shot of the city from there. be mindful not to disturb anyone in our instance there was a funeral procession going on so we waited till everyone left.",
          "This iconic church can be seen as you approach by ship or car. Designed by Jan Inge Hovig and built in the mid-60s, it is an incredible amalgamation of iceberg, church and mountain. The 4m wide concrete panels were cast in place on site. This is a masterpiece, an example of",
          "Interesting structure and is beautiful in the snow, you can see the stained glass through the windows out front, I didn't think it was worth paying to go inside. The views from the out front are great.",
          "Stunning modern architecture with light streaming through the stained glass and great acoustics making a superb venue for the midnight concert",
          "We visited here during the daylight hours then returned for a Midnight Concert . It is a lovely place quite unique in appearance and pleasing to look at both outside and in . The concert was wonderful even if I couldn't understand the words , it was so calm and restful ,",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is unique and cool to see if you are interested in architecture. You can see inside through the windows, and the inside is not very impressive. Wouldn't be worth the entrance fee.",
          "We attended the Midnight concert at the cathedral as part of our Hurtigruten cruise, it was such an amazing experience. the cathedral itself is stunning to look at both during the day and the night. sailing into Tromso it stands out magnificently against the mountain backdrop.",
          "As with most Protestant cathedrals/ churches, the interior is quite plain. The highlight is the stained glass window at the East / Altar side by Victor Sparre. Please check up the internet for details on the window.",
          "If you are religious this may appeal. The design of the building is interesting but when you get there you have to pay to go in. Taking a look through the windows the architecture itself is the interesting feature and this can be seen from a distance. The cathedral is 5-10",
          "It is a really nice building from outside, looks really nice as it is in the hills. we did not go inside as it was a little expenseive for such a small building. we did take a look inside, its like a regular church /cathedral. Must have been beautiful from inside as well.",
          "First of all, I don't know why people complaining about the 50 NOK fee. People would probably spend much more than that to come to Tromso or Norway and it costs almost cheaper than a cup of cappuccino. The fee is probably needed to maintain the amazing building and ground.",
          "We visited here whilst in town on a cruise ship in March. It is situated at the end of the Tromso Bridge and is an easy walk from the main city centre of Tromso. If your ship docks in town, it is perfect. If it docks out of town, you will have to get yourself into the main",
          "Well worth the walk across the bridge in Tromso as its so iconic a really outstanding feathure of the landscape",
          "We visited as part of a trip from our cruise ship. A very modern style triangular church with beautiful stained glass windows. The architecture symbolises the packed ice. The acoustics are said to be very good for the recitals held there.",
          "Very original church. I would recommended it because it\u2019s beautiful and you can see Troms\u00f8 from the other side of the bridge. Recomendable when walking to the Cable Car. The negative side: it costs 50 NOK, which I think is expensive.",
          "We went in a group from our cruise ship to an evening concert which was memorable. Great acoustics and musicians/singer.",
          "Well worth a visit. The cathedral is a simple but effective design but will not take long to see the inside. You may just wish to see the outside as this is the best view and to go in will cost you 50 NOK.",
          "I had long wished to see this icon of the Norwegian arctic and was not disappointed. We visited the Tourist Information Office close to the quay in Troms\u00f8 to buy bus tickets and get directions. Everyone speaks perfect English in Norway so independent travel is very easy. I think",
          "In many other places this would be a church rather than a cathedral, but from the outside it is spectacular and fits right in with the weather and scenery. So spend the 50 krona and go in. It is very nice and the stained glass window is spectacular. I imagine a concert would be",
          "Great landmark of tromso... Must go and check it out... Also if you are lucky enough you might even be able yo experience a concert in it... It claims yo have excellent accoustics.",
          "The exterior speaks for itself, but it is basically a church. As for interior, I skipped it as I am in disagreement one needs to pay to enter a place of religion. You can pretty much see everything from the outside by looking through the glass anyway. It wouldn't have been worth",
          "We went to the midnight concert in the Artic Cathedral from the southbound Hurtigruten boat. The hotel was great when we saw it in the daylight a couple of years ago, but by night with all the candles burning, it was magical. We were treated to some beautiful music by three",
          "We took a stroll around the city and headed to the Arctic Cathedral from the tourist centre. It was a neat building and at the entrance you have a good vantage point to the city scape of Tromso. Recommend to walk there.",
          "A truly amazing piece of architecture. Blends in so well with the arctic landscape. Nice shop to purchase cards and stamps. Lots of space to sit. Would recommend.",
          "The build g is stunning from th eoutside and I side. The stained glass windw and lights were really lovely . Wish there\u2019d been a concert !",
          "Gorgeous building.. looked amazing covered in snow. Its a definent for any visitor to tromso area.. great to stop by on wya to cable car",
          "Must see in Tromso but don't expect a lot. Definitely looks better from distance than close up. Average.",
          "I really enjoyed spending a little time here. It was peaceful and very pretty. You do pay a small fee to enter, so bring money. If you like to light a candle while at church, you will have the opportunity. I was there at nighttime. If I went again I would go a little before",
          "A modern church which gives access to a beautiful glass window and interior. Views across the bridge to Troms\u00f8. Admission fee \u00a35pp but you can take photos inside.",
          "First, I have to mention that the admission fee (at the time, 50 NOK) to the Arctic Cathedral is worth it. Compared to previous cathedrals I've visited over Europe and their architecture - its simplicity and symbolism was breathtaking!",
          "Lovely place to visit. Please check for opening times because they are a bit hit and miss. The northern light show in the celler is ok bit of a laugh.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral in Troms\u00f8 is a beautiful place to visit and photograph, both from the inside as well as from afar (from the Island side).",
          "We went to the midnight concert off a Hurtigruten ship and were very impressed with the architecture. Over the bridge but a must see if you are there",
          "Don't be deceived, it is not a cathedral but a church. It is small, but beautiful, and well worth the admission fee especially if you can get to see it with good sunlight lighting up the amazing glass pane window.",
          "This is worth the visit to see the building and the scenic views around it. It is a popular tourist site and not always open due to services. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "The church is located right off the Troms\u00f8 bridge about a 20 minute walk from downtown. It is a cold walk over the bridge but other than that it is not bad. The church itself is beautiful with Scandinavian architecture and interiors. Worth the visit. Charge is 50k pp",
          "Went to the cathedral but was closed. Got a inner view through the windows on front and on the side. Different and eye catching. In winters, on a sunny day walk to it.",
          "Can be seen from the docks when you are looking for the cable car. So modern and with easy access on the bus route, well worth a visit",
          "A fantastic concert. Definitely not to be missed when in Tromso. Magnificent, modern setting for the performance in the Arctic Cathedral, with beautiful acoustics. Superb performances by saxophonist, soloist and piano/organ.",
          "Visited this cathedral twice and the best time to see it is in the morning sun. When the sun shines through, it completely opens up to show the stunning design.",
          "Nice to take pictures and beautiful inside, but it's very small and has a fee just to walk in. I'd definitely recommend a visit though.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit.it is an excellent cathederal to visit different to what u imagine it to be.",
          "You have to take a bus or cab over the bridge (in winter) but it is definitely worth it. From the church you can get excellent shots of the city of Tromso!",
          "Went to the midnight concert at the cathedral organised by the cruise line and it was terrific. The acoustics were great and the selection of Norwegian songs and music were lovely. Even though it is cold and late it was great.",
          "This is actually a Methodist/Lutheran church but seems to be a general facility available to all faiths. It is a unique design and very impressive inside. It is used for some 500 concerts a year, more that one a day presumably because the acoustics are very good. A very popular",
          "An interesting modern cathedral, the walk across the bridge is very good and it is worth a quick stop to look at the cathedral but the best things in Tromso are natural not man made",
          "The cathedral consists of a simple sanctuary. There is no much history and there are no exhibits and commentary. The visit can be done in 5 minutes. Though the entrance fee is cheap compared to tge cost of anything else in Norway, the quality of experience is not worth commuting",
          "Apparently inspired by ice and snow the Cathedral sits above the port and fjord. Visited it in the early evening and it stood as a beacon of light amidst the February snow. Had the joy of attending a concert there by three musicians, entertaining with Norwegian themed music.",
          "I visited this site on a sunny but very cold morning; a very pleasant walk from the city centre (harbour). The cathedral is as impressive inside as it is on the outside: inside very tasteful decorations among which beautiful stained glass windows. Not to be missed if in Tromso!",
          "Beautiful and worth the visit if it\u2019s on the way but is it worth the price, I don\u2019t reckon. Staff wasn\u2019t friendly or helpful either. Went 5pm 4th March 2018.",
          "If you are passing through Tromso on a Hurtigruten trip, one of the planned excursions is to a Midnight Concert. This is a great experience and the quality of the performance of a mixture of Classical music and Local Folk music was magical.",
          "It's good for a short visit and I really liked the beautiful stained glass. Very easily to be reached by bus 20, 24,26 and 28.",
          "We attended a beautiful concert here . A soprano , piano, cellist and the church organ. It was an hour long and a ticket was required. It was a perfect thing to do at night with an easy bus ride across the bridge. Before entering the Cathedral we spotted a niceAurora to the",
          "For me, the arctic cathedral is really nothing special. It is a nice photomotive, when u take one from the other side of the Bridge, but if you stand in front of it or if u go inside, it is not more than a normal church. I went there for the Northern Lights Concert and was quite",
          "Worth seeing if passing by but wouldn't go out of my way to visit. Its just a modern large place of worship. No character to speak off. Wouldn't go again if in Tromso.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is a Tromso landmark & possibly the first venue that tourists visit. For a 50K fee it is worth a look. The interior is sleek modern & v peaceful with a beautiful stained glass window. My only reason for 3* is it doesn\u2019t take very long to see. 15 minutes &",
          "The cathedral is a real place of peace and calm. The place is alive in the sun. Recommend a visit, better still when you walk across the bridge.",
          "This is a must if you are in Tromso. White as snow, wonderfully illuminated by the sun or by spotlights in the evening. As bonus we had a concert of classic music inside the cathedral.",
          "We only got to visit the place during night time but it was still beautiful. TIP: Plan your day so that you can visit the Cathedral around 11am when there is daylight, because the light comes through the glass and looks magnificent. Then quicky after that, take the cable car up",
          "An excellent example of modern Scandinavian architecture. Winter concerts are organized late in the evening!",
          "We visited the cathedral after walking over the fantastic road bridge on our way to the cable car. If you like modern interesting construction, slabs of concrete making the triangle with glass infills at the joins. Very airy, bright and beautiful at night.",
          "We visited this church while we were at Tromso last week. It was such a beautiful place. While the church itself is not grand in comparison to more traditional churches in Europe, it is very unique with a good location from where you can see the city of Tromso. We stayed at",
          "On tours of Tromso we visited the Arctic Cathedral during the day and also at night for a midnight concert. The triangular church structure was build in 1965 on a commanding hill location. The architect wanted to suggest an arctic landscape. Originally the the glass behind the",
          "We attended the \u201cNorthern Lights Concert\u201d that is offered four nights/week at 11 PM. It was a magical experience. The acoustics of the cathedral are extraordinary and the three musicians are skilled enough to be booked anywhere in the world. The programme itself was",
          "This was on the way from our hotel to the cable car. I had read that it is compared with Sydney Opera house. However, have not visited that so cannot comment, but it is beautiful. Do not pass it, go inside and view. It is also very eye catching when illuminated at night.",
          "We visited this afternoon being in time for the advertised singing concert, paid admission for 50 Krona each and were then advised the concert was only scheduled at 2300 tonight. we feel the entrance fee excessive for <10minutes visit. The Cathedral is impressive inside and out",
          "Spectacular from a distance - less so close up. If you go to the ski lift then make sure to have a quick look here, but a quick look is all you really need.",
          "Beautiful church with great stained glass. Take the walk over the bridge - it\u2019s worth it at least one way if you can. It about 15-20 minutes over bridge",
          "The Artic Cathedral which is at the end of the bridge is on the way to the cable car so you can do both. I walked across the bridge from Tromso City Center which is an easy 20 minute walk but you can drive there or take a bus. There is a small charge to get in, 50 NOK/$6.36. On",
          "When you visit Troms\u00f8, you also visit the cathedral. It was beautiful to see but I think I expected more.",
          "ok for a trip if you have nothing else to do! in the evening the lights shine through the coloured glass windows. inside- nothing to write home about. music was ok. a bit souless",
          "Looks beautiful at night, lit up against the mountains. You can\u2019t help but see it. During the day it can still be seen. The stained glass windows are beautiful. Very much an active place of worship. For me it\u2019s beauty comes alive at night.",
          "My wife and I attended the northern lights concert as a light bit of evening entertainment with the faint hope that we might actually see the aurora if we got away feom the lights of Tromso proper. We were a little confused about which bus to take and if we needed cash for them,",
          "Stunning architecture and amazing acoustics! Went to a Northern Lights concert, half an hour, at 11pm. Well worth it, the sound was beautiful and just as I went in the Aurora appeared and danced around the skies. Magical.",
          "sorry, i really don\"t know what`s special about this church .history? design? art? nothing. it`s better for watch outside or just pass if u don`t have time.",

          "We visited the cathedral at midnight for a concert as part of our Hurtigruten cruise. The cost is high, as one comes to expect in Norway (and Hurtigruten) but the concert was wonderful and the setting really amazing. Inside, the cathedral is quite subdued, with mostly white",
          "The Arctic Cathedral was truly disappointing - it might look a bit special by its looks but its also very selecting as they dont let people in. They didn't open before 1 pm and on top of this they charge 50 NOK to enter. That must be a joke!",
          "It is a magical place. I loved it. The arquitecture is very modern. The sight of the cathedral is beautiful Anyway we decided ro visit and pay the fee but one on my sons decided not to go in the temple The lady in charge of the tickets asked him to leave the entrance hall and",

          "After a walk from the Polar Museum over the big bridge (aprox 30min) we arrived at the Cathedral ( entrance 50NOK = 5\u20ac) Inside simple but worth the entrance fee and a nice place to warm up a little bit in the wintertime.",

          "In my pre-trip research of Tromso I'd seen so many pictures of this church that I was intrigued to see it for real.  I will admit to just peering in through the doors and not actually entering as was more interested in the exterior architecture which is definately unique.",
          "We went over to the Arctic Cathedral for their Northern Lights concert at 11PM. Charming and lovely. Three very good musicians, a soprano, a flautist who also plays the \"yolk,\" (like a tiny piccolo,) and a man who played the piano and organ. The music was about 35 minutes of",

          "The world most northern-most cathedral. The architecture is beautiful, which inspired by the sami culture, externally and internally. There's a bus stop right outside the cathedral if you wish to get there. Otherwise, if you fancy a walk, going across the bridge would bring you",

          "The Arctic Cathedral is in an imposing position, of interesting design. We were disappointed at the charge of 50 Kn to enter. Written up in brochures as spectacular we found the interior to be simple and charming. It\u2019s a lovely place to sit quietly and contemplate or pray but",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is inland just next to the long bridge. It is a modern cathedral and it\u2019s architecture is characteristic. Try to go when de Nordlysfestivalen happend in late january.",
          "It is the landmark of Tromso, a master piece by architect Jan Inge Hoving , inaugurated 1965. The shape and color give associations to an iceberg. The glass mosaic is just magnificent. A place you must visit.",

          "The modern architectural highlight of Tromsoe. Modern, austere, clear lines. Great stain glass windows )but these are difficult to see during the polar night...). A great organ inside, Definitely wirth a visit - you pay an entrance fee just like in Trondheim's cathedrale.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit. The stainglass window, the crystal lights and the organ are all wonderful. The outside of the building is also very impressive.",
          "Attended the Midnight Sun Concert. Just beatiful and the sun rays entering the Church, even at midnight is very special.",
          "What a stunning building. Our trip took us here in the dark. And it really makes an impression when you approach it. Lit up as a fantastic piece of architecture And the dark gives you the opportunity to admire the main window",
          "Beautiful cathedral but the only unfortunate thing was the church was closed. This would have been excellent as i walked so far and would not go inside",
          "Walk over the bridge or catch the bus - great views from outside. The building is impressive and in keeping with the surrounds. The inside is modern - simplistic but with a lovely feeling. Beautiful window, comfy pews and a comfortable seating area.",
          "This cathedral is worth seeing from the outside. The stained glass windows amazing. but i found the interior to be quite stark.",
          "As many others have put the architecture outside is the best feature, inside is as you would expect the workings of a cathedral and very simplistic so unless there is a concert on or you want to visit for religious reasons then not worth the 50NOK entrance fee. Beautifully",
          "We attended a Sunday morning service here in January. Lovely to hear the hymns (especially away in a manger ) in Norwegian. We were very lucky when we went as there were 4 infants being baptised and some of the girls in the congregation were dressed in traditional national",
          "Walked over the bridge to the cathedral - what a great view but watch the winds. The cathedral stained glass was lovely but can be admired from outside rather than inside but for 50k it was nice to get out of the cold",
          "The best view of the Arctic Cathedral is from the waterfront in the city center at night, not from inside the church. Don't bother with the easy but very expensive bus ride and the admission charge unless you are seeing a concert or want to go to a service. The pipe organ is",
          "Personally would skip the 50 krone entrance and enjoy it from the outside. The stained glass is far more attractive from outside and there is nothing much to see inside. Best if there is a concert or coincides with an organ recital, otherwise not worth a fee.",
          "Lovely church that we visited on Christmas Eve. We were graciously allowed to sit in on the Christmas Eve service. Afterward we walked around to see the inside and outside of the church. It makes for stunning pictures at dusk/night with the inside lights.",

          "Very plain on the inside but a fine looking building on the outside. Distinctive. If you don't want to walk over the bridge - you can catch buses from the centre of Tromso (No 20)",
          "Definitely worth a walk over the bridge to see, also lovely views back over the bridge to Troms\u00f8 island",
          "We walked across the bridge from Tromso, unfortunately we couldn't go inside as there was a funeral in progress. We took some great photos of Tromso from that side, would definitely recommend a visit, very different architecture.",
          "Spectacular setting for the midnight concert in which, among other exquisite pieces, Grieg was featured at length. Highly worth a visit due to its unique architecture.",
          "The outside looks very nice and different. Inside, after you paid your entrance fee it's a little boring....",
          "We walked from our hotel to the cable car and back. The Arctic Cathedral looks impressive from across the river but on our return journey seeing the stained glass window all lit up in the twilight - wow!",
          "We walked over the bridge from which there are great views on the way. The Arctic Cathedral is a spectacular building that is lit up at night and is a real feature of Tromso. We didn't go inside.but recommend walking to the rear of the building to appreciate the stained glass",
          "was here again after 2014 and we had tickets for a midnight concert. THe artists were a female singer, a pianist and a female flute player. The program were nothern norwegian songs and some old traditional songs fro mthe Samen. Very interesting performance, some songs were",
          "This is a stunning building but I would save your money and not bother going in. In my opinion the most beautiful part of the building is the stained glass window, visible from behind. There are a few stunning chandeliers inside but for me otherwise it was unremarkable (if you",
          "We walked across the bridge during the polar nights and saw the cathedral on our way to the cable car. The architecture is beautiful, particularly when illuminated at night. I highly recommend checking out the exterior. We didn't go inside as it didn't seem worth the cost and",
          "We walked over the bridge twice in order to see the Cathedral during the day and at night. It looks wonderful lit up and made for some really nice photographs!",
          "I was a bit dissapointed. I thought I could expect more but when we arrived there was actually nothing special. If you are in Tromso and you are not able to go to the cathedral you are not gonna miss anything.",
          "The walk from centre city cooler than the church. Just go. You\u2019ll see everything you need to see in 10 minutes.",
          "Ok, so I'm not dissing this wonderful building, but rather like Sydney Opera House it's better viewed from the Mossman ferry than close up. When seen against the backdrop of the mountains it is lovely, but having slogged across the bridge in a blizzard, it was utterly",
          "We visited this lovely cathedral on a two day stay in Tromso. The outside is the most impressive part and it is worth walking around the back to view the stained glass from outside - particularly in the dark. The building is sleek and not like other cathedrals although I think",
          "The Ishavskatedralen is Troms\u00f8\u2018s landmark and well worth the walk across the bridge. The view of the city and the fjord is great from the bridge and the cathedral. We did it during polar night darkness and I can recommend it. The illumination is beautiful and the look is iconic.",
          "Ishavskatedralen (The Arctic Cathedral) is supposedly the northernmost church in the world. The building itself is very unique, with great views overlooking downtown Tromso. Do check the opening hours before visiting to avoid disappointment not being able to enter the building.",
          "worth the visit if only for the exterior - funeral in progress when we visited - stained glass is stunning by night",
          "We joined the Christmas Service on Dec. 24th. It was in Norwegian language, but that didn't bother us at all.",
          "After enjoying views from the top of the cable car, we traipsed through the snow to have a look at the cathedral only to find it was closed. A group of school kids charged past us in the hope of visiting it as well, so not sure who knows when to visit. But as the buses stop",
          "The building is impressive from the outside and looks beautiful both by day & by night (lit up) The structure replicates jagged icebergs,striking white with glass accents Can be seen from across the bridge and is worth the bridge walk (weather permitting) Entry fee of 50 NOK",
          "Artic Cathedral is unique in terms of its architecture. Different! Impresive! You ca go to Midnight Sun concerts!!",
          "We\u2019d read about Tromso\u2019s impressive and iconic Ishavskatedralen (it\u2019s a church not a cathedral apparently) so decided to walk there from the Fjellheisen cable car (about 10 minutes away through a pleasant suburb). Opened in 1965, it consists of 11 steeply angled aluminium coated",
          "The cathedral was closed but we could see through the windows. It is empty beside bench... Nothing really interesting, worth to go just to take pictures.",
          "Nice to see when it's night at the outside. Inside (entrance NOK 50) not so spectacular. Maybe in summer when the sun shines.",
          "Beautiful! What more can I add! A stunning addition to our trip to Tromso and even more magical on New Years Eve. We were even lucky enough to have a Northern Lights display on our departure from the concert! Wow! Beautiful building, clean and well organised. Staff friendly and",
          "You can take either bus 20, 24 or 26 to get there. Usually takes about 30-40 minutes to walk around, make some pictures, enjoy the view and go back to bus stop, that way, the ticket you purchased to go to the church will be still valid to return or continue you way. This time of",
          "Unexpected that admission was charged. Could be walked to from city center but take wind into account as crossing the bridge could be challenging when it is cold. Beautiful inside and worth a visit but is just as beautiful from the outside or lit up at night.",
          "You can see the church from the other side of the bridge and it is an impressive design. Worth a walk over the bridge to see it.",
          "Great atmosphere , with the sun sinking then rising again, as we were there in June during the midnight sun season. Seemed odd for it to be getting brighter again after the concert. There were 3 musicians, just a short concert, but definitely worth going",
          "Interesting building from outside. Not so much inside. Worth the bridge walk if not too windy otherwise take the (very expensive) bus. Close to the cable car .. both nice if sunny and not too windy.",
          "We walked here from tromso city center which was a pleasant walk across the bridge. It's a very unique church but cooler to photograph from a far. Can get good views of Tromso Island.",
          "We\u2019ve been to Tromso twice, but this was our first visit inside the Cathedral. We were lucky enough to attend a midnight concert in the Cathedral this Christmas while on our Hurtigruten cruise and it was simple but stunning and the acoustics were brilliant. While it\u2019s \ud83d\udcaffrom",
          "The Hurtigruten ship stops on the Northern sailing during the day. Time to enjoy Tromso be daylight. The Cathedral is beautiful architecture replicating jagged icebergs -- striking white with the stained glass colored accent. Great views of Tromso as it sits high on a hill. On",
          "We attended the annual Christmas concert. It was lovely evening filled with wonderful Christmas hymns and music. We took a bus there, and it was easy and quick. We walked back to our hotel, a lovely and scenic walk over the bridge.",
          "We hiked across the river bridge to the building from the harbour. It may be more impressive in the winter than summer since it is all lit against the dark sky. From what we could see inside is spartan and functional. Its the exterieur that's so remarkable. Lovely stained glass",
          "I was told this was closed today , however expecting to arrive to talk some external pictures I was not surprised as it was Sunday to find the doors open and the church full to capacity - the music and the crowds were amazing and it added to a wonderful Christmas Eve.",
          "Outside is a beautiful structure and a great view of Troms\u00f8. We paid 50 kroner per person to go inside. It was worth the small price. A band was practicing and we got to hear them. The inside is beautiful. Parking is easy. They have a lot next to the building and just across",
          "We were there this December and the cathedral is made out of iron and steel recovered from a sunk German war ship ! It\u2019s a piece of history worth visiting",
          "Caught the local bus - make sure you have a prepaid travel card - as it is quite a walk from Tromso town across the bridge. Cathedral is beautiful but only requires a short visit to see everything. We walked on and caught the ski lift which gave beautiful views.",
          "The Arctic cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Tromso. The church looks great from outside and the best views are at night when the lights are on. It costs NOK 50 per person to get inside the church, however there is nothing inside to view so don\u2019t waste your money,",
          "We could see the cathedral light up from our hotel (Clarion With - stay there; it\u2019s great) and wanted to see it close up. It is beautiful - wonderful use of glass and light. The downside ? It was closed to visitors, even though it was the middle of the day and there were",
          "This Cathedral I think is last and biggest towards the Artic circle. Its stained glass and chandeliers are just fantastic. A must visit when in Tromso.",
          "A good piece of art is timeless. This is exactly what the Norwegian architect, Jan Inge Hovig, did for Arctic Cathedral. It reminded me of Frank Lloyd Wright's design for the Guggenheim museum in NYC. It is such a pity that this Cathedral had erratic opening times and charges",
          "A very modern lutheran church built in the 70ies. From an architecture point of view it's quite a thinking to design and build a structure in that fashion. You can catch a buss right from the centrum to this place, or you can walk which probably take about 25 minutes from the",
          "The highlight of Troms\u00f8, and possibly the most beautiful building in the entire North of Norway. Best viewed fromt the outside in winter, and best viewed from the inside in summer, so you'll have to visit twice. The building itself is the real star here, look at how the cross is",
          "We visited the Cathedral based on good reviews about it. As I expected, the building was very nice and modern; I really appreciated the design. Since we couldn't go inside because of the Christmas Concert, I highly recommend checking opening hours before coming here.",
          "We only got to view from the outside as we arrived around noon. I nice spot for some pictures though. You need to walk under the bridge to get round to the front of the building. We would have liked to have a cuppa and a cake in the area but could not find anywhere to do this.",
          "If you are on one of the Hurtigruten cruises and you are thinking twice about booking the Midnight concert at the Artic Cathedral, don't because it interrupts your nights sleep. Catch up on your sleep later and go. It is absolutely magnificent church and a magnificent concert.",
          "when you happened to be in Tromso , it is a must to visit.you will see a very nice view of the island and the sea . A must!!!",
          "This is definitely worth a visit for the window. To see the lovely colours and design you have to walk outside around the back of the cathedral. The inside is very plain.",
          "We went on a very snowy day but still enjoyed the lovely cathedral. Don't miss the stained glass window in the back. One thing to note is that it does not open until late in the day so we got there after 12:30 and it was not open yet. We still took some beautiful pictures. We",
          "Perched high up on the hill, next to the road to the cable car to the mountain! It is modern and outstanding! Well done!",
          "It is a very nice cathedral but on my visit from 4 dec. to 9 dec. 2017 it was most of the time closed, i\u00b4d said closed AT ALL TIMES, according with what other fellow tourists told me.THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED, IT IS NOT NICE FOR AL THE VISITORS WHO COME IN DECEMBER TO FIND IT",
          "This cathedral is a must on anyone's visiting list, very friendly welcome from Patricia who was very helpful.",
          "The church is nice enough, with a stained glass facade on one side that\u2019s very pretty in the dark, but there\u2019s nothing very interesting about it on the inside - skip it on the trip to the other side of Troms\u00f8, or else just take pics of the exterior - no need to go inside.",
          "The outside of the building can be seen all round and looks fab , so thinking the inside would be better we paid \u00a35 to go in .. no atmosphere no information no anything totally waste of money if you want to see it look in the window . The slope down it\u2019s not for the faint heated",
          "The church looks great from far away- and is quite pretty looking closely... We found even nice Aquarell paintings from troms\u00f8 a regions and met the artist:-) Just careful in case it is snowing/freezing/... the entrance is slippery ;-kr",
          "Very nice place to stop by during the dark winter nights. In contrast to other Lutherian churches in Norway, this one is open for tourists. The entrance fee is 50 NOK. Also check the back side with its colourful mosaic.",
          "The view from outside of the Cathedral is very pretty, overlooking the city. Its 50Nok to go inside the Cathedral, which was quite pricey. Was bit disappointed inside, expected more.",
          "Great building. Really different and interesting to look at. Big inside. Right next to main road. Walked over bridge from main tromso to get to.",
          "Very icy slippy walk up to the cathedral, in early winter shoe spikes might be an idea. We went in and then were told it wasn't actually open, they kindly let us look around however the stain glass wasn't lit up. Check opening hours prior to visiting. Looks prettier from",

          "This is a lovely building but if going to it via the big white bridge be careful very snowy and slippy. It is up and down hill so if not good on feet think twice. You could get a taxi around road but still slopes up to get to cathedral when get out of taxi. Go in the summer or",

          "The church has really big windows. If you want to take a picture of the church with the colored glass you have to take it from the back. When we attended the concert we thought it was going to be very lively however, it was a mixture of fast and slow classical music. There were",

          "The midnight concerts are amazing, but the building itself is worth a visit although very modern. A nice walk over the huge bridge from the centre of Troms\u00f8 / the Hurtigruten dock. 5 NOK entry for building only. Concerts require individual booking.",

          "The building itself is a very interesting structure. The construction is simple, yet beautiful. The special architecture of the building makes this church a true piece of art, even though it lacks the traditional decorations you can find in many churches throughout Europe. The",
          "First of all something that is not well known to tourists: it\u2019s only opened from 3pm to 6pm. We were there in the morning so saw it from the outside. The inside isn\u2019t very special - very plain. From the outside, it\u2019s stunning and visible from most parts of the island of Tromso.",
          "The Arctic Cathedral is a simple yet stunning structure. It's beauty lies in the simple yet very functional architecture and also in its location in relation to Tromso. Definitely worth a visit!"

          "We didn\u2019t see much of the lights, probably only for around 5 minutes on the camera but it was quite cloudy and Mother Nature can\u2019t be helped. Hot chocolate and cakes were great. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the lights and took us to the best spots to wait. Mini bus was",
          "This was by far our family's favorite activity - despite the kids being \"meh\" about it prior. Our kids, including younger son, could've spent the day on the trails with the dogs. If you're nervous or hesitant because you have kids, don't be! Make sure this excursion/activity is",
          "Best thing I\u2019ve ever done! Honestly if you\u2019re in tromso and love dogs- go. They\u2019re such happy friendly animals who absolutely love their jobs. The staff are amazing and tell you exactly what to do. You\u2019re in total control and are out on your own and it\u2019s so so much fun. I\u2019d give",

          "After having \"gone to the dogs\" ;-) with Tromso Safari last week, I let myself be tempted and booked another, because I credit this operator with one of the best days of my life (precisely the one I spent dog-sledding, and about which I also posted a review). This excursion was",
          "My daughter and myself with few others went for a day for dog sledge last Sunday. It was a great experience as we had a very experienced guide. We went for about 1.5 hours up the hill. We certainly recommend this experience",

          "Being at a specific base is not the best choice to \"hunt\" the northern lights. The guide told us they almost all the time go to this specific base because it has the best weather conditions in the area. Unfortunately the weather was very bad(snow and clouds). We waited all night",

          "A very smooth and professional operation where you have the opportunity to meet and spend time with the huskies, drive and ride on your own sled over a 10 KM course. Really good fun. Its a 45-60 minute bus trip each way, but well worth it. All footwear & gloves & snow suit &",
          "It was our first time riding sleds with huskies. We picked morning session and really glad we did as we had enough light during the ride to enjoy the scenery and the dogs. Tour was very well organized and Tromso Huskies Team was very welcoming, went through all details and made",
          "Leader Allie is perfect, she is a detail-minded person with great photo shooting skills, make sure everyone is enjoy and comfortable during the whole journey, highly recommend we see the northern light on the first day we arrive in Tromso, what a great trip ever!",
          "I booked a northern lights tour with Tromso Safari on my last night in Norway and that was a great choice. The team at the counter (especially Babang) made sure when I booked that I had chances to see the lights rather than only care about selling me the ticket, they took time",
          "Tromso Safari\u2019s tour made our night. They helped us with our photographs, they provided us with a tripod, they made a few pictures of us in front of the northern lights and showed us some breathtaking locations in Norway.",

          "Wow!! From the minute we met the team from Tromso Safari, we were met with smiles. After a stunning drive to the farm, we met with the amazing crew, who ran us through everything we needed to know for how to drive the team. We then met our team of huskies, where we had the time",
          "It\u2019s the fantastic experience to ride the snow mobile. They provide hot chocolate to warm up the body during riding and provide hot fish soup after the riding. The whole riding takes about 1 hour, great!",
          "They are located inside the Radisson Blue hotel so they\u2019re always busy and don\u2019t really care about repeat business. Everyone that works there is very nice, but their job is to sell. We went on an aurora minibus and were told if we didn\u2019t see the northern lights we could go again",
          "We are really enjoy with the Husky ride. Especially you are standing behind. Good experience and shall try it..",
          "We drove the snowmobiles for a maximum of 45 minutes of the whole day with a lot of stops. The tour is just up the hill close to the road and cabins were the \"tour\"begins. Would certainly NOT recommend this to anyone. And its a 2h ride from Troms\u00f6 to the actual place. Maximum",
          "Amazing trip in the wild mountains!! The dogs are very friendly and love to be pet. The two owners were very kind and they explained everything perfectly, so we weren't lost at all on the sledge.",
          "This experience was nothing short of amazing. The scenery takes your breath away. Driving and riding in the sled was so much fun!! The guides were extremely courteous and would even stop the sleds if a party got too far behind. I would highly recommend this excursion!!",

          "It was a hell of a ride through the woods in a blizzard with your trusty team of huskies. Not only do you get to learn how to control a husky sled, you get a close up encounter with the doggos! A sustainable, knowledgeable operator, highly recommended!",
          "Great trip, brandnew katamaran. Can buy drinks, soups, sandwiches on board. Very well organized and super friendly staff. Dress warm",
          "On 13th October with a group of friends we went on a Troms\u00f8 Safari Northern Lights tour to a dark location by a fjord about an hour from Troms\u00f8. The facilities and staff were excellent. Warm drinks were provided, a comfortable cabin was provided to keep warm. Outside it was dark",
          "I joined the minibus tour with Elizabeth as the guide last week. Both Elizabeth and the driver were fabulous. They both made everyone feel comfortable (even solo travels) with lots of great conversation. It was fun to learn about Tromso on the bus ride there and we stopped",

The Troms\u00f8 Safari team were very professional, informative and engaging and",
          "We went on a Northern Lights tour with Tromso Safari and were very disappointed in the tour. Our disappointment was solely to do with the tour guide on the night. Our guide was a young Spanish woman. While she was a pleasant lady and she did the necessary bits she and some",
          "This has to be one of my favorite highlights of our trip to Norway! When planning our trip to Tromso, I really wanted to try dog sledding. There are lots of companies that offer dog sledding activities. We chose this one because we were flying in to Tromso around 10:00 a.m.",
          "The team at Tromso Safari is amazing. Even with prior to our trip with emails and information they were absolutely helpful. On our first night in Tromso we went on a 15 person Northern Lights chase. Our guides and driver was bee knowledgeable and really wanted us to experience",
          "Must do activity to get new experiences and get close to K9 those very friendly to all visitors. Sledding was fun and worth of time and money.",
          "We had a great day in the middle of the Norwegian Winterlandscape! When arriving we got a short instruction how to handle the sled and the dogs.. easy to understand - not that much one could do wrong. Warm cloths were provided in all different sizes, so equipment was perfect.",
          "In our trip to Tromso, my spouse and friends booked two different operators to hedge our chances of seeing the northern lights. We booked Tromso Safari Base Station and another company (Chasing Lights). Overall, Tromso Safari was terrible in many ways compared to the other",
          "Some of my tours (with other operators) were cancelled due to only me signing up, Troms\u00f8 Safari helped me get new activities booked as little as an hour in advance. They were helpful for their own tours, finding my way around town, and even tours from other operators, showing",
          "Troms\u00f8 Safari is the way to go especially if you\u2019re staying at Raddison Blu as they are located in the ground foyer. I pre booked all of my tours except for 1 before I left for my holiday. The girls at the front desk were very patient answering everyone\u2019s questions with a smile.",
          "Just got back from our trip and it was fantastic, totally enjoyed the whole day, Carl was our guide and he was great, very patient and explained everything well the time on the snow mobile was great and we were going at a good speed, when we got back we had soup and cake, I",
          "Hello together, I visited Troms\u00f8 to participate in the Nordic light chase tour. The city is called the Paris of the north and also the gate to the arctic. I can say both is correct. If you want to have a good choice of entertainment after your tour you will get it in Troms\u00f8.",
          "We made 2 activities with Tromso Safari (hiking & dog sleeding) and it was very nice. The staff is great as well. The German of the hiking was nice and the Italian who introduced the dog sleeding in the car has a so great English accent. Congratulations Tromso Safari, great",

          "This was awesome. Getting to take turns with my friend driving the Huskies was so cool & this whole experience exceeded our already high expectations. Huskies were so beaut !!",
          "The forecast wasn\u2019t great weather-wise, however we drove for an hour and a half to a reindeer camp. The lights were out as soon as we arrived which was exciting. The stay at the base camp felt excessively long in cold conditions given the lights came out more than once, 3-4",
          "We reached the snowmobile centre after a bus and ferry ride and quickly got kitted out and trained in the operation of the Ski-doos! We set off and had a fantastic couple of hours snowmobiling through more breathtaking scenery! The machines are quite big and quite heavy and",
          "We booked this trip as a last-minute option for the next day, and it was a great choice. We really liked it, especially the atmosphere and the presentation about Sami culture in the tent. Thumbs up!",
          "I got to Tromso late and made a last minute decision to join the tour. Ayaka was our guide and Froda was our driver. They took us to an area by the sea with mountains on both sides. The sky was clear and the Aurora Borealis was just magnificent!! Ayaka took several pictures of",
          "Enjoyed out time. Was abit of a long 1.5 hour couch ride out of the city but that was due to weather, had we not do this wr would not have seen any night sky and no opportunity to see the aurora. We went to a sami tent and we paid extra for the raindeer soup. This soup was",
          "Everything was just great: the briefing was very serious but was also humorous. Than each capple got a sled with 6 huskies and the trek began. It was great sometimes you had to help the dogs by pushing the sled uphill and sometimes you had to push the breaks so the sled will not",
          "We had a wonderful time dog sledding. The team was incredibly nice and welcoming. They started by giving us all the instructions and safety procedures. The dogs were amazing and the landscapes more beautiful than what we could have imagined ! We highly recommend booking with",

          "We did snowmobile tour on 24feb as a family of four. The tour itself was nice however not well organised. At the beginning they take you by bus to the ferry . After 10 mins ferry ride you arrive at the venue. On boarding the bus, we were told to take out the jackets etc as it",
          "Had booked the tour to watch the Aurora. Was informed by the tour agent that the tour guide has a camera which can take take our pictures if we dont have a proper camera (you need a proper SLR to take the aurora pictures) and it will be sent by Dropbox. If you do have SLR, the",

          "We took these two trips in the second half of March, a perfect time to visit Troms\u00f8 on an aurora quest because the days aren\u2019t too short and the weather isn\u2019t too cold. We were fortunate to see the northern lights on both trips, but our experience at the Aurora Safari Base",
          "The bus left Tromso in heavy snow and after about 1 3/4 hours arrived at the base station - a warm Sami style wooden hut. The local Sami chap was most welcoming and his reindeer stew was great. (toilets on site) The clouds parted and the Northern Lights appeared,Magical! Gudmund",
          "We had THE BEST northern lights trip !!! We were met by our guide William (who was incredible knowledgable about everything) and driven 1.5hrs by coach with about 30 other people to a base camp in Skibotn. On arrival the camp was very beautiful with two lavvu lit by candles and",
          "I would like to personally thank this company for the great experience I had with you guys. On the first night there we went on a mini bus tour with Bekey. She was a very enthusiastic guide and tried her hardest to find an opening in the clouds, but with no such luck we went",
          "Highlight of our trip to Tromso. Nice to leave the city and see some of the beautiful surrounding countryside. Well organised with very friendly staff. Snow mobiles were easy to operate and route was varied and beautiful. Warming soup on our return as very welcome and delicious",
          "Professional organised trip and even on a cloudy snowy night we were able to see the Northern lights thanks to our guide Gudmund. We were taken to a reindeer farm a couple of hours drive outside Tromso. Gudmund helped the group with their camera settings as well as providing",
          "The tour guides, dogs, and husky sledding experience were nothing short of amazing! This was something on my bucket list and it did not disappoint. You get to meet your entire team of dogs before the ride, and once you get going they take you through the raw landscape of the",
          "My husband and I took this tour while we were in Tromso for our honeymoon and had an absolutely amazing time! Our guide was knowledgeable about the lights, the history and the stars. Even when the lights weren't that strong (though we did get lucky and see an amazing display",

          "This is a brilliant trip. At 4 hours it\u2019s just the right length. A 45 minute bus ride gets you to the husky centre, where you get changed into thermal and have your safety demo/learn how to ride the sled. Then it\u2019s a 10km run, with 2 stops along the way to change drivers if you",
          "We went with Tromso Safari simply because the better-rated TripAdvisor tours (such as 'Chasing Lights') were full by the time I booked - and that was a week before. Tromso Safari was available and departed from our hotel (the Radisson Blu) so we went with them. The positives",
          "After an attempt to see the northern lights in Iceland in October 2019 with no luck, I decided to spend 4 nights in Tromso and how lucky I was. The second night I took the Aurora Safari mini bus, after some hours waiting, walking in snow down to one beach and no luck, we kept",
          "The pickup point was at the harbor and the bus drive was about 1:20 with additional 10 minutes on the ferry. Afterwards our guide picked us up and we had to walk round about 500m to the start point. There they provided a jumpsuit, helmet, gloves, ski mask as well as boots.",
          "We were very lucky, less than half an hour drive, the lady was out and showed us her pretty self. Our guide was Morten and John was our driver, both are very good with their job! We were at 3 different locations that night and saw different colours of lights.",
          "An amazing experience in Troms\u00f8 with the huskies. A coach picked us up at the Radisson hotel and upon arrival to the husky location we were greeted by two lovely ladies. We were given instructions and a demonstration of how to use the sled and then prepared for the trip changing",
          "Today we had our first snow mobile tour and it was amazing. All tour guides were friendly and the tour itself took about 2 hrs with 2 stops. At some points you were allowed to go quite fast which was really fun. The two dogs which accompanied us were very cute, especially the 11",

          "We rode the catamaran. The boat tour is quite long but it allows to see the wild fjords, and we enjoyed it as a part of the journey. We saw orca/killer whales after a few hours of sailing. The tour seemed to respect wild life and laws instead of others that got too close to the",
          "Our guide was very friendly and professional. The tour took us to natural/wild places with no city light where we saw beautiful auroras (we were very lucky as the auroras depend on the meteorological and solar conditions, the guide cannot guarantee that you will see them). The",
          "We booked the tour long time ago from our home country in the hope to take a small boat, with few people and to get really close to the whales. We dressed with all the clothes they gave us and left everything behind because we couldn\u00b4t take it on the boat. So, we sail for about",
          "We did whale watching from the catamaran, dog sledding with huskies and snow mobiling and they were all absolutely amazing. After reading other reviews I was apprehensive about the whale watching especially when we got onboard and the guide said that we would not be going to",
          "This is a must if you go to Tromso, the people who run this are brilliant, you have plenty of time to enjoy a thrilling experience, you will end up and see where the dogs reside",
          "We had originally booked to go on the safari by RIB on the Wednesday, when we arrived we were informed that the RIB could not go out due to high winds, but were given the options to either cancel, re-book or go on the catamaran. We re-booked and had the same outcome the next",
          "The trip starts with a coach to the ferry along a scenic route, followed by a scenic ferry crossing on a comfortable ferry with cafe, followed by a short walk to the venue. The guides are organised and equipment is in good condition, dogs are fun to have around. But the best bit",
          "Used these to see Orcas and Also a Northern Lights base camp trip. Both were amazing. Of course it helped the fact we seen lots of Orcas and the Northern lights were out the entire time we were at the camp. The guides were good on both trips.",
          "I wasn't sure what to expect from this company after having read other recent reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised. Although the customer service reps at the Raddison Blu Hotel were fairly unfriendly, the other staff on the boat were nice. We didn't go north to the island",
          "So glad we booked this trip as unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to see the whales. We were very lucky with the Northern Lights which stayed out for hours. We went on the small tour minibus. Alessandra was our guide. She was brilliant. She knew lots about the lights and treated us",
          "After driving around a couple of night in our own rental car and not had seen the light we knew we needed some help from teh pro's. And these guys delivered. Beside a very interesting film in the luxury bus and a step by step instruction on how to set your camera there was hot",

          "We used Tromso Safari last year for Northern Lights chase, and twice this year for Northern Lights chase and husky sledding. In terms of honesty, they score 100%. They cannot make it any clearer that seeing the Northern Lights is far from guaranteed, whatever the weather. Our",

          "We booked the aurora cruise last minute in the morning via internet for the same night. We got the four spots we needed and boarded the beautiful old style boat on time. There were many rooms all over the ship where people where waiting and talking with the staff. We could move",
          "We booked the mini bus tour to stay in a smaller Group. Although the conditions were not very good (cloudy and snow fall) our guide Miriam managed to find a spot with clear skies were we could spot some Northern Lights. She also took some awsome photos that we received for free",
          "First of all, there is no guaranty to see the aurora. It is a matter of luck and weatherconditioms. On the night of my trip the chances to see the lights were low and it was freezing.5 minutes before the tour was over, the lights came out - lucky me. The guides were highly",
          "I booked the northern light based camp tour by mistake via another agent. We did see the northern light and the food were lovely. What I am really disappointed is I asked the tour guide to take a photo of us before I am travelling with my mum, he said he would if he has",
          "Despite the large group this tour is well organised and all staff are very friendly. The introduction and instructions for the sledges by the two ladies was down in a serious way but with lots of sense of humour. The staff was at all time happy to answer questions about these",
          "We booked a whale watch tour and went in north-westerly direction, even so everybody said that the whales are north-east of Tr\u00f8mso this year. Only saw a few orcas from a very far distance, no humpbacks at all. We drove 4:15 hours with the boat....tourist information promised 7",
          "We have choosen \"Tromoso Safari\" for whale safari on 25th december and we did indeed spotted whales and northern lights tour on 23rd December. While Whale Safari tour was success our northern light tour unfortunately was not as expected since there is very low activity that",
          "I took the catamaran trip for whales/orcas and after sailing and freezing on deck for 5-6 hours, we did not see anything at all other than some birds. I had previously taken two other whale watching trips in other parts of the world, also with no results, and I understand that",
          "We would like to especially thank you Martha and Tor who guided us on the 30th of December during a northern light safari! This night was not predicted to be successful (all indicators and weather were not supposed to be part of the trip), but as Martha well explained to us,",
          "We, two friends from Switzerland, had booked the Husky safari and it was great fun! It was a cold day at the end of December 2017 (around -20 degrees) and it had just snowed the days before. The guides were very helpful and provided helpful information and some snow gear",

          "My husband and I have had chasing the northern lights on our bucket list for years, so we decided that we would end 2017 in Tromso and see if we could tick it off before the year was out... and amazingly for us we were successful. This is primarily down to Tromso Safari who we",
          "Disaster. The boat took us back to the hotel 1 hour earlier than expected without watching any whale after more than two hours trip to get to the best place. We could have used that time to look for the whales instead of rushing back to port. Total waste of time for an early new",
          "After 2 hours drive from the pickup point in Tromso we arrived at the base camp in Skibotn. The night was clear and cold (-16 C) but we had a fire and a tent to warm us up. We did not wait long before seeing our first Aurora. Then the sky became cloudy for a while and cleared up",
          "I participated in the \"27.12.2017 Aurora Safari Minibus Marte\". Thanks to the best guide and the driver, I saw various beautiful Nothern lights. I felt the flow of Solar wind which seemed whispering something unknown to me! Alessandro was a very nice guide and I thank her for",
          "I took this tour at the last minute after sleeping through the aurora activity on the Hurtigruten ferry and also on the previous two nights in Tromso. The timing was perfect because the sky was highly charged and the aurora was already visible from the center of town itself.",
          "RIB boat whale safari was great fun - not for the faint hearted! Most of the journey is by a large catamaran where there are multiple safaris on tge same boat. The highlight is the actual fast driving ok RIB boat in search of whales - we were lucky to sea humpback whales three",
          "We took this tour on a whim because we had already seen the Aurora on an earlier trip in Ivalo but this surpassed everything we had seen. Thanks to Alessandro Belleli and Odd Gunnar. Wonderful guide and driver. We saw the green lady, the lady in pink, and the coronas. Wonderful",
          "We did the cruise to see the whales, which was a wonderful experience. The boat is run down and could do with a little refurbishment but it was worth it. The fjords were amazing and we got to see the killer whales. At night we did the northern lights minibus tour with William",
          "We were fortunate enough to see the Northern lights on an evening when they were absolutely spectacular and thanks to William (our tour guide for the evening) and his experience and intuition we saw the lights in their full glory. This really was a night (and a Christmas) to",
          "We went to Skjerv\u00f8y to watch the whales. The first part of the trip (2.5 h) was on a catamaran. The boat was a bit run-down. Coffee, tea, water, and cookies were for free. The audio of the speakers is very bad. The Italian guide on board was terrible. We appreciated his efforts,",
          "I did this trip on 12/18/17 and had the best time ever! I really couldnt recommend this enough. I look forward to my next trip to Tromso so that I can do it again. The guides were great and the dogs were amazing. The landscape and the trail that you take is simply beautiful.",
          "The northern light got to be the main event for everyone visiting tromso on autumn. We choose the mini van safari which starts at 7 pm from the radisson blu hotel (which is very easily found). Our guide for the night was Paulo, he's very funny, helpful and informative off",
          "We took a few tours with Troms\u00f8 Safari and we were pleased with them. We were met on time at the Radisson Blu and picked up in suitable vehicles. The trips were not over crowded, in fact the groups we were in were small but this is not a bad thing as it meant we had more time",
          "I booked three tours with Tromso Safari on consecutive nights, Aurora Basecamp, Aurora Safari Minibus and \"Best Kept Secret\". Both the Basecamp and Minibus tours were well organised with knowledgable guides. Despite the blizzards we saw the aurora on both nights. A big shout",
          "The bus left right on time from the Radisson Blu, right across the street from the Scanic. R bus was about half full, and it played a video that talked about the places we were driving past. A tour on the tour bus! It was great. After a quick 40 minute drive, we got to the dog",
          "This is a tour I most certainly recommend. The staff is very professional, kind and easy to understand. The quality of the equipment is perfect. Being able to ride the sled yourself was so much fun, they almost had to pull me off when the trip was over. Thanks Tromso Safari!",
          "Overall, very pleasant and informative staff who were always very smiley and happy to help. Despite this, not only was the trip 3 1/2 hours travelling to the whales feeding ground through sometimes choppy waters, we also were unfortunate enough not to see any whales.",

          "I'm going to be honest, on our 4 day trip in Tromso we didn't get to see the northern lights.... the first night we were booked with another tour, the second our trip with another company got cancelled due to advers weather conditions, and the last we booked with Tromso Safari",
          "Although this trip was quite expensive it was worth every penny. We went on the catamaran Aurora explorer. The journey to reach the whales was almost 3 and a half hours due to the location of the whales. The arctic wilderness was a sight to see and the polar sky was amazing.",
          "We\u2019ve been on a couple of tours on the catamaran - and even with the very rough seas the captain and crew were great. The location is amazing - not just the whales!",
          "We really enjoyed this trip. It was an amazing experience for us. Our tour guide Miriam was nice and gave us a lot of information on the trip out. We went to M\u00e5lselv base station where Elisabeth, the host, gave us a good welcome. The base station is so wonderful and warm. Miriam",

          "Booked for 2 adults and 2 kids. The boat was a rather big catamaran, but not the one you expect with a net between both sides, The boat was very comfortable. We were welcomed by an English speaking guide, she spoke clearly and answered all the questions the tourists had. During",

          "From geology to Sami life & culture - there\u2019s so much to see and absorb in what is actually a small museum. Fantastic film about the Northern Lights too (among others at a little screening area at the back of the geology section) which we watched as a bit of educational prep and",
          "We were on an organized tour, and unfortunately didn't have nearly enough time to spend in this very interesting museum. Our guide took us to the Sami displays, and while it was very interesting, I would have liked to have seen more of the museum. I could see the large",
          "Nice visit of an interesting museum where we have improved our knowledge about nature, human being and so on. I kindly recommend it.",
          "exhibition mostly for school children but very nice to sit in the sami house next to the museum and get to know more about the life over a cup of coffee.",
          "This museum could be great, but it has flaws. Firstly, the layout of the museum is lacking. Half of the downstairs exhibition is devoted to general geology and volcanos, which seems unnecessary. The upstairs exhibitions of Sami culture and their rights, I'm sure would be very",
          "If you are curious about the Sami people, the indigenous people of north Scandinavia, this is a great place to learn about them. There is a whole section on the second floor dedicated to them. It is very thorough and very respectfully done.",
          "The exhibition in the museum was very interesting. It reflected the warmth of the people and the colours found in the black and white landscape.",
          "We stopped at the museum as part of an excursion booked through our cruise ship. It's a small, but very interesting museum. We stayed with our tour guide who focused on the Sami exhibition which was fascinating and sad in many ways - much like the history of so many other",
          "Lots of interesting artifacts and exhibits but a bit of a challenge for one who does not read Norwegian well.",
          "So much is in the world we do not know. Learning about other cultures and what made us brings one to a humble admition we all are creatures of love, pride, dignity, gumption and dreams.",
          "This is a university based museum with some great exhibitions and information and a large Sami exhibition which is protected but I would have liked to see it structured a little better for the tourist,around the precise history through time of Tromso itself",
          "My husband, daughter and I spent a few hours browsing and interacting with a variety of exhibits. The live insects and creepy crawlies was a real surprise, and at the same time so interesting to see. We enjoyed the explanation of the Northern Lights, probably the best we have",
          "Worth the 3km walk (or a bus ride) out to the Museum. There is a lot of information regarding the area, and a big exhibition on the Sami history and culture.",
          "We came here as part of a tour off our cruise boat so our guide explained the exhibits since several were only titled in Norwegian. We only toured the natural history (lots of stuffed animals) and Sami galleries, but they were well done and informative. We especially liked the",
          "I am afraid to say there is not much to look at if you are English, Norwegian writing mostly, the Northern Lights floor was the only interesting part and there was not much of that. Personally not worth the \u00a312 each entry fee, with nothing else to do nearby, not worth the 45",
          "Good place to spend an hour or two before flight back to the UK and get out of the snow. Loved the section on Early human migrations into to Scandinavia.",
          "Visited here while staying in the city, there were extra temp exhibits on which I think may be how we spent so long going around it all. Cost to get in was quite cheap, and a cup of tea was even cheaper, just what you needed after walking around in the snow all day! There",
          "The museum provides good details about the culture, history, animals, birds etc. It could have been made more contemporary. We had to abandon our visit there half way since the fire alarm started ringing and hence entire place was evacuated. The outside ambience was very good.",
          "The Museum has a really well prepared & very interesting exhibitions, among others - about the Sami people.",
          "In an hour (in November 2017) I got a solid understanding of my ancestors, some of whom came from near Tromso in Norway's far north. Modest as the museum is, a lot of information is conveyed well, including recounting Norway's history of mistreating its Sami minority with more",
          "The museum is quite small, descriptions are in Norwegian and just sometimes in English. They show a 30 minute video about the northern lights which I can recommend to visit. All fine, especially considering the low entrance fee. However, nothing special and only worth it if you",
          "Nice museum, very kind people. Part of mueum is about tropical spiders etc, not to be expected here. Museum is planning to rebuild in the next years.",
          "Came on the basis of the reviews here. Unfortunately, we were most interested in the Sami of the past exhibition, but no English information available. Also I find keeping live insects and arachnids in small tanks for humans to ogle at kind of disturbing. Sure, it's informative,",
          "We really enjoyed our visit today. A nice afternoon learning about the history of the area and its people. I enjoyed learning something about Sami culture, accomplishments, and future, as well as about the natural history here.",
          "Interesting history of Tromso and Norway. Lots of artefacts and information with a guided tour. Small gift shop at entrance with handmade items.",
          "Went with my wife. Saw lots of good stuff. The solar winds and sami exhibits were really informative. The lady at the end of the day sorted out our ride back. Thank you. And thank you for your amazing English.",
          "Decent museum with a variety of things to see - from native animals to the way folks lived and their tools as well as ocean travel. Kids under 12 would probably like this.",
          "Museum is good for kids very interested history about Saami people. The museum had a wonderful movie about the Northern Light.",
          "A beautiful display of statues, carvings etc from old Norwegian churches plus interactive displays in the climate display. Knowing nothing about the Sami people, I found the section there confusing however the excellent gift shop had a book on their history, culture and politics",
          "We enjoyed seeing the museum. The gift shop had souvenirs that were better quality and price than available in the shops. I came back to buy after our visit.",
          "Along with the natural history of Norway, there was a floor dedicated to the history of the Sami culture, the indigenous people of Norway. The telling of this history mirrors the history of so many people around the world. It is presented in pictures and artifacts and is worth",
          "This was our first visit. There is a 25 minute film on the Northern Lights which is interesting. The exhibits could do with modernising. Cafe- service lovely but very limited food.",
          "Was interesting to find out a lot about the Sami people and also the wildlife that live in the Arctic. Went with the family and got in using the Tromso Pass which I would highly recommend.",
          "Small museum with an entrance fee of 60 NOK. One exhibition about Arctic animals, one about Sami culture, one changing exhibition and one mix of different things. Worth a visit, but don' t expect to see unseen things.",
          "I like it. The entrance cost 60 but if you buy a double ticket for the polar museum and this you can pay 80 for both... Is nice... Beautiful and with story... They give you an english's guide",
          "A very interesting museum, but the best attraction is outside the museum When you come out of the main door turn left, then left again to walk down the road about 50 metres and on the right there is a sign. Tucked in the edge of the bush with a grass roof is a Sami structure.",
          "Was particularly interested in the exhibition on the Sami people. This place is worth a visit - excellent displays and material in English.",
          "The Tromso Museum was a nice place to visit. This museum has am interesting display on the Aurora Borealis.Also, there is a section that documents the life of the Sami people and it also has some interesting artifacts.",
          "The museum at university it is really interesting and worth a visit, it is rather big and with many different exhibitions, explains well the different aspects of life in the Arctic regions, ranging from animals to pollution and the northern lights. Easy to reach if you have a",
          "Norways explora history is interesting and somewhat brutal. Lots of arctic animals has been killed for absolutly nothing. And eventhough the exibithion is somewhat old its interessting",
          "I thought we\u2019d nip round here fairly rapidly. Wrong. Quiet, calm and restful wander around a range of fascinating exhibits loosely based on Troms\u00f8 and the surrounding area. Not very interactive- so young children may get a bit restive. NB: THREE MUSEUM TICKET - At NOK30",
          "I really found the Sami exhibition very interesting and enlightening. Both the one showing their traditional way of life, but also the one following their struggle to gain recognition and rights as a nation. We had a lovely visit to the Sami house, where a very friendly and",
          "A nice place that tells a bit about the original inhabitants - the Sami (who were not bound by political borders - they lived/wandered in Norway, Sweden and Finland - around the mountains they share.",
          "The various exhibits and displays provide a unique and effective introduction to the nature and culture of the northern regions of Norway. The exhibits and displays are well done with quality explanations that will help you understand what you are viewing. There is an",
          "Visited as part of a tour and was impressed with the quality of the displays and visuals. They have a beautiful video of aurora borealis! The Sami display was made even better by the guide that led us through. They have done a great job of honoring their indigenous population.",
          "The Museum is frequently visited by bigger groups of the visitors. From city center Bus no 37 is leaving, every half an hour for this Museum. It would be more interesting to the visitors if the films and more photos are displayed to show the life of Sami people and their animals.",
          "This museum is fabulous!! and you can pay a little more for your entry and get entry to the polar museum included, a good saving. The staff were so helpful, we asked what time the film of the Northern lights showed , we were told to just let the young lady know when we were",
          "It seemed to be small from outside but there are actually lots to see. From animals and plants in Norway, aurora light show, to history of Nordic inhabitants, one should spend half day here to experience the effort they have put in. There is also a good collection of books",
          "This museum requires a short bus ride on the number 37 bus if you are staying in the city centre, but it is worth it (use the mobile apps for travel planning and ticketing for a cheaper price). There are quite a few different exhibits, my favourite was the one about Sami",
          "A room follow the other, it a quite big museum with all details you are looking for about local history. A guide in more or less every language is available",
          "A guide is definitely worth having to help explain the Sami history and the development of the region. There are also exhibits dealing with religion and natural history. A very interesting museum.",
          "Worth a visit for the history of Sami nation. Good information and friendly staff. Would recommend especially when coupled with a walk from Tromso Centre.",
          "It has the history I wanted to know and very nice exhibits. Plus some artifacts I cannot imagine finding anywhere else. Take a taxiing you are not good with maps. I got lost walking there from city center but I am really no5 good with a map. Taxi is cheap enough.",
          "We enjoyed the exhibitions on Sami culture, very interesting and informative. Tasty, freshly made waffles in the cafe were delicious. We also visited the park beyond the museum and walked along the beach. There are buses but it was only a half hour walk from the centre.",
          "The Tromso Museum is housed near Tromso University and has some sections on Northern Lights and some on Arctic Life. Somehow, it lacks some objective and number of exhibits to have any impact on you. You can visit if you have time. The shop in entry foyer has some interesting",
          "This is an interesting museum, if a little out of the way - the bus will take you within a minute of it though. The exhibits are nice and informative, although it's odd how there's very little of the town's history itself, despite the name. I really liked the Sami exhibitions,",
          "Althought it\u2019s a but far from the centre, it\u2019s a good place to go and stay warm. Exhibition is only writen in norwegian so you have to follow a guide which is tricky. Ask for the combined ticket for Tromso Museum and Polar Museum. Also recommended the small path around the sea",
          "It's a small, but nice, museum. Natural history is solid, if simple. The exhibit on the Sami and their place in Norwegian life was the best part of the museum and it was nice to see that, finally, in a museum. The museum is out of the town center, and the bus ride out to the end",
          "Well I think a town museum should tell you at least something of the history of the place. Settlement, geography, ancient and modern history. This museum does not have any information on Troms\u00f8. Nice section on the northern lights, nice displays of arctic animals and global",
          "Well worth a visit ,kept very clean and tidy, with a wealth of history and knowlege of a great country",
          "Must seen museum in Troms\u00f8. It is not really big but very informative. The musuem is in the city center of Troms\u00f8. They have also a small gift shop.",
          "Had to kill some day time hence went to this museum with no expectations but was pleasantly suprised. Kids loved it and museum contains evolution sections related to Darwin , about Sami culture and there is also a film about Northern lights to be seen. But we had already seen",
          "My husband and I visited here recently and thoroughly enjoyed learning about the Sami people. The exhibits are super interesting with such rich history. We just wish more of it could have been in English. Tip: It's a lovely (but long) walk from the downtown area. We walked from",
          "What a brilliant place to spend an afternoon. Un-prepossessing from the outside, the museum was one of the best days of our two week stay in Tromso. The compelling narrative of the great arctic explorations that fills a huge chunk of this museum left us both overwhelmed at the",
          "This university museum had enough culture and tradition for me and enough science and technology for him. Good overview of Semi fight for recgnition. Nice overview of how and what the lights are formed. Good thing we took a taxi as it's not a straight amble from the centre on",
          "A friendly welcome from staff. Some interesting exhibitions from this area with a focus on the original people\u2019s , Sami, who lived and worked in this area many years ago. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is very informative you can touch the displays shame not all the written information is in English",
          "Spent an enjoyable day at the museum, there was a lift to the first floor which made it very accessible for me and my wheelchair. Didn\u2019t know anything about Sami culture before the visit, but feel we know more now. The ticket allows us to visit the polar,useum ehich we will do",
          "Interesting location right on the water, with some great information on the local terrain. Some good exhibits.",
          "This was a very interesting museum that contained a lot of exhibits to give a really good understanding of life around Tromso. It was well laid out and easy to follow the displays. Well worth a visit.",
          "We went to the museum bc of poor weather and our tour that day was canceled. The displays are well done and you learn quite a bit about the local and regional history. To read the whole English pamphlet they provide while you tour the rooms takes a good hour. There are lots of",
          "We had a lovely visit to the museum. So informative with some fantastic graphics and displays. Really good insight into Norwegian and Sami culture, really well displayed. Do visit as you will not be disappointed.",
          "A small museum dedicated to the history of the local area. The exhibits are interesting, informative and relevant in understanding the development of the community in and around Troms\u00f8. It includes an excellent explanation of the science behind the Northern Lights which we saw",
          "Entrance is Free and the experience is extremely interesting. Details and exhibitions of real life experiences of local people going back over a century. Lot's of great photo's capturing the harsh conditions of living in the artic conditions. Very Worthwhile a visit",
          "Extremely interesting but although some parts were in English others were not so although I have some Norwegian I felt I missed out on parts of it. Non English speakers would have even more of a problem. the contents of the museum were absolutely brilliant though.",
          "If you wish a quick overview of Natural Norway, the Sami People (Finmark Region), Political History mixed with science this is the place. Very nice displays with sort narratives. Located in a residential area, initially challenging to find, but well worth the visit. Use your 2",
          "I'm having my northern light tour in this museum and having a great time afterwards. If you like to visit museum and getting to know about history this is nice place to visit. The staff is very friendly and helpful and also there's a nice caffe that you can visit in here to warm",
          "It is an interesting museu, very interactive,some parts need English translation, different topics: history, Aurora, native people, etc",
          "There was a variety of things to see and interact with. I found all the information on the sami people very fasinating. An enjoyable but educational experience!!",
          "An all encompassing museum that covers Sami history, vikings, ocean life, Norwegian wild animals and pests around the house :D There is also a very good film that goes on a loop so make sure you talk to the front desk for the times. The building also houses a tourist shop.",
          "The Tromso Museum has a good combination ticket (Tromso Museum + Ploar Museum) costing 60 NOK. The exhibition on the ground floor which has exhibits about the animals and birds of Northern Norway was fascinating. The museum also has a Northern Lights exhibit with an interactive",
          "The museum is on the university's grounds. Free weekend parking. Interesting exhibits on a smaller scale. Particularly appreciated the gallery that showcased the Sami people's history and culture. There is a cafe there that offers decent hot drinks. Free wifi.",
          "This not a large building but it contains a lot of historical in the 3-floor structure. We visited on a rather rainy day so windows/doors were closed. By the time we reached the top floor, it we VERY warm and stuffy. The majority of the info was in Norwegian but there was a",
          "The Troms\u00f8 museum has exhibits of the wildlife and fauna of the arctic area with a few taxidermic animals like the king of the arctic. The highlight is the exhibition of the Sami culture which gives a new perspective of these first inhabitants of the great north and their fight",
          "The best bit for me was going insdie the sami hut (to the side of the building- with smoke coming out) and having a hot drink and listening to the stories. Beware you will smell very smokey afterwards!",
          "We went here as stopping by 1 day in Tromso off peak season - no midnight sun, no northern lights. This museum is a good way to spend 1-2 hours to get a mix of light information on nature, Sami and northern lights. If you have never looked up the origin of the aurora borealis,",
          "Loved our day in Tromso. We visited Tromso Museum in a group. The Art and artefacts were very interesting. Friendly helpful staff. One young woman was from the same place as us - Liverpool, England! Her Dad works as an engineer in Tromso. Small world! Everything here is",
          "This listing really should be renamed because the museum is actually called the Troms\u00f8 University Museum. It is located slight out of town from the center on the university campus. There are, however, a couple of buses that go out there and it is only a 10 minute or so ride.",
          "We can definitely recommend the museum. It is a small museum mainly dealing about the Sami people, history and culture. Outside the museum is a Sami hut and you get free coffee and nice stories about the culture. At 13:30 the museum offers a guided tour through the exhibition.",
          "I liked the location, a bit away from the centre, and I loved the different museum parts. Not only do we learn about the S\u00e1mi, the Northern lights, the \"humans and fire\" etc etc, but also about the history of cultural exhibitions (if you know how to look..). It is clear that",
          "Very nice experience in this museum, especially for children. Everything is explained with a lot of details and it is easier to understand things this way.",
          "Catch the 37 bus - which goes 'past' if you aren't watching the signs. Afterwards we caught the 33 bus at the bottom of the hill (5 minutes walk past the operating Sami hut). If you are interested in the environment and in indigenous history you will really enjoy this",
          "It's all about the culture, living standard, history and religion of Troms\u00f8. Quick review in short time, know more about the little town in Arctic circle. Only NOK60 for the entry! (May 13, 2017)",
          "If you're crunched for time this place might be just a step below priority. It contains enough information to provide a good bases for understanding the Sami culture which makes the Tromso area more enjoyable to visit. If you do have time, stop here first before traveling to the",
          "I believe that all museum-items in Tromso coud be concentrated in one bigger museum. As they are, there are not enough materials to sustain separate museums. Especially the Museum of Tromso is a very-very poor 3 little rooms musem, mostly with photos. Within this context, the",
          "Interesting exhibition about the Same culture, but clearly several decades old and quite worn. Deserves a thorough brush-up.",
          "When we got there, on a rainy day (yes rain, not snow, April can be cruel) the place was deserted. We took a bus from the centre of Tromso and it took a while to get there (it was quite far on foot) and we were expecting a lot more. The best thing was the Sami exhibition: very",
          "Interesting museum with a good mix of exhibits. Passed an enjoyable couple of hours here. The museum is more informative than interactive, go with limited expectations and you won't be disappointed. My 7 year old son enjoyed it, particularly the animal exhibits.",
          "We went to the local store (our equivalent to a seven eleven) and bought a bus pass. The cashier explained to us what the best routes were. We ended up at the museum where they had several displays of Norwegian history and artifacts dating back centuries. Definitely worth the",
          "I went to this museum during a visit to Tromso. There is an excellent display showing details of the northern lights, there is also good information and displays on the Sami People. There is also much of interest in other displays. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended.",
          "If you're looking for something to fill in time, this is a pretty good place to spend some time. We like to explore new places on foot, so we took off in search of the walking path that should take you there. We had a nice walk through the city of Tromso and came out right by",
          "I had a nice walk there for about 30-40 minutes from the city center. It was my first time learning about Sami people, their ways of living and cultures. It is so beautiful and I am happy I went there. Besides that, I also get to know more about Arctic wildlife, the northern",

          "Very nice place, full of history and interesting decoration illustrating it. The exhibitions are full of information. The store is a little bit expensive. You have to take a bus or a cab to go there, unless you're in the mood for an hour walk - too cold in February, when I've",
          "We got the city bus from opposite the tourist information office and got off at Folkenparken and had a wonderful walk through the snowy forest and then we reached the Tromso Museum, at that time we had just less than an hour so the lady let us in free of charge which was a",
          "It had some interesting exhibits, but much seemed to be kid oriented. It was very hands on which could be fun, but much of it was damaged.",
          "A great Sami exhibition plus local archaeology and global changes. The aurora exhibition part very interesting. They could do with some more English guide sheets. Very limited facilities for food and drink Good cloakroom with lockers and places to hang coats. A moderate 3km",
          "Tea was only 10 nok which is probably the cheapest in the whole of Tromso. The exhibits were very interesting with local wildlife, Sami culture and the northern lights all really well explained. Great walk from Tromso round the shoreline.",
          "We liked this musuem a lot, there was a wide range of historical, natural and cultural exhibitions. The natural history of tromso was very interesting. All researched from local university. The highlight was the Northern Lights guided tour which was very informative. Well worth",
          "If you want to see the show on the Northern lights you need to book a place at least 24 hours before hand, we didn't realise this so couldn't get to see it which was a shame as that is why we went to the museum. The cafe was closed (we went on a Saturday).",
          "Interactive learning experience for kids. Why are so many exhibits written in Norwegian only? OK museum for a rainy day.",
          "Interesting learning with kids - playful methodology used - experimenting and quizzing all the way through ... leaning about evolution ... both our boys had a great time !",

          "The museum has a number of different sections: sumi history, northern lights, man's use of fire, evolution, arctic animals. Everything is well done, professional and a number of displays are interactive. They have a number of displays at toddler height which is very sweet.",

          "Although this place is far from the city centre, we thoroughly enjoyed the exhibits. When we went, there were exhibits on Charles Darwin and natural selection, fire in the Stone ages and my favorite, the Tromso Palm. A real gem in the middle of nowhere.",
          "A short bus ride away from Tromso centre this is a great place to visit. Lots of local information and history to see. Great exhibits with lots of English translations. We watched a short video on the Northern Lights, beautiful shots and time sensitive scenes. Quite a few",

          "Very interesting about local history and culture of Noerthern Norway.The Same and religion chapter are the best parts.Also very interesting the explaining of northern lights.You can acces the museum easily by bus,but taxi to there,is expensive.I suggest it,to all Tromso visitors.",
          "A beautiful modern building, with helpful staff. Informative displays on N Norway archaeology, anthropology etc Senior tickets available (they asked us). It is a little way out of town but under an hours walk including Telegraph point (buses & taxis easy too)",
          "I really enjoyed this museum! So much information and very interactive. The Sami section and the section with the religious artefacts were my favourite. I would recommend anyone visiting Tromso make a stop at this place.",
          "Everything you wanted to know about the Sami, the early days of life in the Arctic and other bits and pieces too. Not a lot about the 20th century from 1914-1945 which might be interesting to find out about. Good interactive displays and a good shop with standard Norwegian",
          "A great museum , great for kids.We arrived and the place was closed(they had changed the opening hour to 11.00 a.m) However as would only happen in Norway, they opened up for us early. It is a distance from the centre and quite expensive by taxi.",
          "A small museum that looks at local Sami culture, rock formations, Northern lights and a few other little things. Interesting displays and it is really funny to read some of the English on the displays as they are not quite correct. For example: one display ask about",
          "As I see it, the most interesting thing to see at this museum is the explanation on how the Northern Lights occur. By all means, the museum have many different exhibitions, but if you are not particularly interested in the first place, these will not appeal to you in particular.",
          "Varied displays, allowing you to move on or linger over the displays at your own pace. A bus trip to the edges of town, a worthy addition if you are unfamiliar with this part of the world",

          "This museum does a great job of explaining the original inhabitants of the area, the Sami people (who I learned about in school as the Laplanders) with artifacts and dioramas. It also has interesting information on the Northern Lights. They also have displays of Viking culture",

          "Great cultural exhibits ranging from the Stone Age to the Sami people and beyond. It was fascinating to see the homes, clothing and tools used by these old civilizations. The only disappointment was that the museum closed earlier than we anticipated. Leave plenty of time for",
          "There was alot to see in this museum and i think is one of the best in Troms\u00f8. I took a walk from the central to the museum, it was a nice walk to see the houses on the way. On the returm journey, i took the coastal walk which is totally scenic! Please go if you have time",
          "I learned a lot at this museum. Much more than at other far more expensive ones in Troms\u00f8. There is a good selection of information and displays about evolution, which I'm not sure was always of direct relevance, but did link well to the history of settlement in the area. Lots",
          "The Tromso University Museum is well worth a visit, and I would be allowing a couple of hours minimum, There are a variety of interesting and educational displays that give a good overview of the indigenous peoples, the Sami way of life, including clothing ,housing, hunting,",
          "This museum is one of the best I've visited. The mail reason is because the permanent exhibitions are anchored in this region. The two Sami departments space over a 7000 year time lapse. The northern light section is really informative and essay to understand. The arctic",
          "The entry was fairly cheap as a student. There were a couple of new exhibits that were well presented with English information and were an excellent introduction to some of the local history and culture on my first day. Some of the older exhibits were not in English but were",
          "It is the University museum, rather poor but still interesting as gives you a genuine view of local culture and the its original inhabitant: the Sami people. A little more investment from the community would do good",

          "We decided to tour Tromso on our own and took the city bus to this museum. There is information about the artic area and the Sami people, native to the area. It is a small museum so it doesn't take long but worth a visit just to learn about the Sami.",
          "This was a fantastic museum - we spent nearly 3 hours there getting a good feel for the area. Our favourite part (father and two sons, aged 11 and 17) was meeting and talking with the young student in the Sami hut in the museum grounds. Thank you, Ulva, for taking the time to",
          "If you want to get a feel about the origins of the city of Tromso and the surrounding area, this is the best place to start. The Tromso Museum is kitted out like a traditional museum but has some modern parts with a bit of interactivity for younger and less academic visitors",
          "Tromso Museum is a place where you can get the information about the arctic circle animals and life. You will see many fossilized animals include the pole bear. Nice place to visit and enjoy.",

          "As a good antidote to full board on the Hurtigruten ferry the walk to the museum takes a brisk 30 minutes each way and is worth it. The explanation of the history of the Sami people and a section on the more recent history since the war is well laid out. Everything in the museum",
          "A little way out of town but easy to reach on the 37 bus, this is a lovely little museum. Great exhibition on the Sami, and a nice collection if church art from before the Reformation. Very helpful staff.",

          "This museum offers a little bit of everything but I thought overall it was pretty interesting. The only thing that could improve is the restaurant.. it wasn't much more then a self-service coffee machine.",
          "The museum is a bit far from center but definatly worth a visit. If you buy \u00e0 prepaid ticket at several locations for 36nok one way. And if you bought \u00e0 comboticket for the polarmuseum you can save \u00e0 bit more. There are some really beatiful naturescenes with stuffed animals to",

          "I recommend going to visit this museum. It just is all what I wanted to see in a museum. Learning about the northern lights and see how people in Norway live(d). It is 45 minutes walk out of the city center, but you can also get there by bus.",
          "On our last day in Troms\u00f8, my friend and I decided to go check out the museum scene in the city. She had heard about this place through a friend who goes to the university there. There was a Northern Lights exhibition that clearly explained how the phenomenon worked as well as",

          "We visited the Troms\u00f8 Museum after having visited Polaria & The Polar Museum. I definitely preferred this museum on the whole. The Northern Lights film was much better then the one at Polaria, featuring more detailed history surrounding the myths and legends in the old days",
          "This was worth a visit, we went as part of a Tromso tour, but I wouldn't have made a special effort to go. The displays were informative. If you are passing then pop in.",
          "This is a very interesting museum, which covers all aspects of hard life, survival and exploration in the northern arctic. Images of seal hunting might worry children but it is all very instructive.",
          "We hopped on a bus, one of the many, in Tromso and had a very pleasant trip up to the museum. The staff were very welcoming and helpful and the exhibits beautifully laid out. We particularly enjoyed the display relating to the history of the Sami people and of course the",
          "10 minutes by bus from the centre of Tromso, this is an intestine little museum. There are several themes eg evolution, Sami culture and its place in modern Norway, and naturally the Northern lights. For non-Norwegians most of the captions are in English. There are a series of",

          "Well I guess with the Polar Museum in the middle of town, they had to put the Tromso Museum somewhere else! Its a bit of a trek by walking trail tho there's a half-hourly bus (destination on front displaying 'Tromso Museum' number 37 I think) that does a loop from Tromso and",
          "Our friend's sister-in-law took us to the museum. In a small space, the museum covers the natural and cultural history of the area. I'd recommend a visit here although it is a bit far from the city center.",

          "It's looks quite small but there are different exhibition in it. Check for combined tickets and family ticket. You can save some money which is always worth of it in Norway. I enjoyed very much an exhibition about Sami people living in this area in the last and today. Also",
          "This is a great museum. There are many different types of exhibits from costumes and lives of the Sami people to what causes the Northern Lights. Highly recommend.",
          "Great place to learn all about Tromso and its History. You can get both this Museum and Polar Museum visit combo at the Tromso Visitor Centre. We got a private tour to learn more about the Northern Lights and why it exists. The tour guide, Kat, was nice and friendly. You can",
          "With the student discount, we got a combination ticket with only NOK 40 per person. It's definitely a great deal considering its profound exhibition. It includes quite some interesting info relating to the arctic lives, and several interactive introductions. Some could even",
          "We took the 20 bus from centre. It is a circular route past the Tromso museum. The bus journey itself was interesting, past the Tromso suburbs with spacious houses all lit up for Christmas. Joint ticket for this and the polar museum at a reduced price. The museum is on two",

          "Tromso Museum consists of many different exhibits. It contains Archaeology, Darwin's principle, Sami culture, Aurora lights etc as exhibits. It also has a souvenir shop, a cafeteria & helpful staff. This place will require at least 2 hours to completely go through the entire",
          "It's a little outside the main town but REALLY worth the trip. Drive or take the bus. Local wildlife and climate change issues, exhibitions on the Sami people and the mystery of the body in the bog. Something for all ages - cafe and classy gift shop too.",
          "We visited this museum on a rainy day. There were 2 floors with a lot to see. Personally I would have liked more of the written information to be in English so I could have learned more than I did. Definitely recommended.",

          "We went there in the hope of learning a lot more about the Sami culture, and we certainly did. Not sure how it works at other times, but we basically had a private class for the better part of one hour. We just walked up, and the host/guide invited us to sit down and start",
          "If visiting this museum you will be told of the past and how Norway has evolved over the decades from tribes to now.",

          "Overall this feels like a local museum designed for local families. After reading reviews here, I am sorry that we missed the Sami tent outside. I don't know if it was there because my companions were in a great hurry to get out of here and go back to Tromso to see other",

          "In all our visits in Northern Norway this time we have heard about the Sami but this museum gave us the depth of understanding of the history and the lives of the Sami people and how their lives and culture fit into the life of Norway. We learnt so much about the modern people,",
          "The Tromso University Museum is 2.5km from the city center. The detailed exhibitions are so interesting about the Samir people, Artic wildlife, Viking longhouse and medieval church art. There is also a full scale dinosaur. I would have liked more exhibits to have English",
          "Troms\u00f8 Museum offers different rooms where tourists can be delighted with a excellent explanation from Northern Lights to the Sami culture back on time. Important to mention the reference to the room of Samis after the WWII, where one can get a really good impression about all",
          "As anything and everything in Norway has something that would hold you,Museum also does the same trick. The Museum is a small but place with abandon amount of information. Take walk through the streets and enjoy way side shopping also.",

          "Interesting and engaging but not so easy to get to by public transportation. Had we known we'd have taken a taxi. The explanations for the various exhibits were not always in English or were only briefly summarized in English. After all it is Norway; I should neither expect",

          "Reading several other reviews in this section I think some people have mixed the museums up. This one is not the museum about arctic exploration or about seals, whaling etc - nor is it close to the harbour. This one is near the southern tip of Tromso Island, about 30 mins",

          "I spent over 4 hours inside this cool museum. It looks so tiny from the outside but it's actually quite roomy. It's divided in sections and you can definetly lose yourself in there. Not everything was available in english, so you had to figure out or ask someone what was going",
          "The museum is divided into various halls. One on the fauna of the Arctic regions of northern Norway. One on the Sami people and their culture. One on the history of the region. It really is very distinctive and different to the museums in town. The hall treating Sami history",

        "wiki": "Elverh\u00f8y Church (Norwegian: Elverh\u00f8y kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. It is located in the city of Troms\u00f8. It is the church for the Elverh\u00f8y parish which is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland. The church was built in its current location in 1974 and it now seats about 435 people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis church building was originally built in 1803 on the site of the present Troms\u00f8 Cathedral. The church, then simply known as Troms\u00f8 Church served the whole city of Troms\u00f8. In 1844, the new Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was established and Troms\u00f8 was to be the seat of the Bishop. A new cathedral was commissioned and in 1861, the new Troms\u00f8 Cathedral was completed. This new cathedral was on the same site as the Troms\u00f8 Church, so that church was dismantled and moved a few hundred meters south of the city boundary. It was located outside the city and was then known as the Landkirke (meaning rural church) and later it was renamed the Troms\u00f8ysund Church. During that time, it was the parish church for the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund. After the new Tromsdalen Church was built in 1965 as the new \"main church\" for Troms\u00f8ysund, this church was eventually closed, dismantled, and moved once again.In 1974, this church building was reopened as Elverh\u00f8y Church, about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) west of the city centre of Troms\u00f8 on the island of Troms\u00f8ya. A full basement was built for its present location, making room for a parish hall, kitchen, cloakroom, and bathroom facilities. It is now somewhat different than its original design. Now, the red, wooden church is a cruciform design constructed with cog jointed timber and the siding is vertical panelling. There is a large steeple over the main entrance now that was not originally present when it was built in 1803.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Troms\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElverh\u00f8y kirke website",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

        "wiki": "The reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), also known as the caribou in North America, is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, native to Arctic, sub-Arctic, tundra, boreal, and mountainous regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. This includes both sedentary and migratory populations. Rangifer herd size varies greatly in different geographic regions. The Taimyr herd of migrating Siberian tundra reindeer (R. t. sibiricus) in Russia is the largest wild reindeer herd in the world, varying between 400,000 and 1,000,000. What was once the second largest herd is the migratory boreal woodland caribou (R. t. caribou) George River herd in Canada, with former variations between 28,000 and 385,000. As of January 2018, there are fewer than 9,000 animals estimated to be left in the George River herd, as reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The New York Times reported in April 2018 of the disappearance of the only herd of southern mountain caribou in the lower 48 states, with an expert calling it \"functionally extinct\" after the herd's size dwindled to a mere three animals.Rangifer varies in size and colour from the smallest, the Svalbard reindeer, to the largest, the boreal woodland caribou. The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska through Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains. The barren-ground caribou, Porcupine caribou, and Peary caribou live in the tundra, while the shy boreal woodland caribou prefer the boreal forest. The Porcupine caribou and the barren-ground caribou form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga. The migrations of Porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any mammal. Barren-ground caribou are also found in Kitaa in Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.Some subspecies are rare and at least one has already become extinct: the Queen Charlotte Islands caribou of Canada. Historically, the range of the sedentary boreal woodland caribou covered more than half of Canada and into the northern States in the U.S. Woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as threatened in 2002 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34,000 boreal woodland caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada.(Environment Canada, 2011b). Siberian tundra reindeer herds are in decline, and Rangifer tarandus is considered to be vulnerable by the IUCN.\nArctic peoples have depended on caribou for food, clothing, and shelter, such as the Caribou Inuit, the inland-dwelling Inuit of the Kivalliq Region in northern Canada, the Caribou Clan in Yukon, the Inupiat, the Inuvialuit, the H\u00e4n, the Northern Tutchone, and the Gwich'in (who followed the Porcupine caribou for millennia). Hunting wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer are important to several Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples such as the Duhalar for meat, hides, antlers, milk, and transportation. The Sami people (S\u00e1pmi) have also depended on reindeer herding and fishing for centuries. In S\u00e1pmi, reindeer pull pulks.Male and female reindeer can grow antlers annually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly between population and season. Antlers are typically larger on males. In traditional festive legend, Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus deliver gifts to good children on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nCarl Linnaeus chose the name Rangifer for the reindeer genus, which Albertus Magnus used in his De animalibus, fol. Liber 22, Cap. 268: \"Dicitur Rangyfer quasi ramifer\". This word may go back to the Saami word raingo. Linnaeus chose the word tarandus as the specific epithet, making reference to Ulisse Aldrovandi's Quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia fol. 859\u2013863, Cap. 30: De Tarando (1621). However, Aldrovandi and Konrad Gesner \u2013 thought that rangifer and tarandus were two separate animals. In any case, the tarandos name goes back to Aristotle and Theophrastus.\nThe use of the terms Reindeer and caribou for essentially the same animal can cause confusion, but the IUCN clearly delineates the issue: \"The world's Caribou and Reindeer are classified as a single species Rangifer tarandus. Reindeer is the European name for the species while in North America, the species is known as Caribou.\" The word rein is of Norse origin. The word deer was originally broader in meaning, but became more specific over time. In Middle English, der meant a wild animal of any kind, in contrast to cattle. The word caribou comes through French, from the Mi'kmaq qalipu, meaning \"snow shoveler\", referring to its habit of pawing through the snow for food.Because of its importance to many cultures, Rangifer tarandus and some of its subspecies have names in many languages. Inuktitut is spoken in the eastern Arctic, and the caribou is known by the name tuktu. The Gwich\u2019in people have over two dozen distinct caribou-related words.Names for reindeer in languages spoken throughout their (former) native range \n\n\n== Taxonomy and evolution ==\nThe species' taxonomic name, Rangifer tarandus, was defined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The woodland caribou subspecies' taxonomic name Rangifer tarandus caribou was defined by Gmelin in 1788.\nBased on Banfield's often-cited A Revision of the Reindeer and Caribou, Genus Rangifer (1961), R. t. caboti (the Labrador caribou), R. t. osborni (Osborn's caribou\u2014from British Columbia) and R. t. terraenovae (the Newfoundland caribou) were considered invalid and included in R. t. caribou.\nSome recent authorities have considered them all valid, even suggesting that they are quite distinct. In their book entitled Mammal Species of the World, American zoologist Don E. Wilson and DeeAnn Reeder agree with Valerius Geist, specialist on large North American mammals, that this range actually includes several subspecies.Geist (2007) argued that the \"true woodland caribou, the uniformly dark, small-maned type with the frontally emphasised, flat-beamed antlers\", which is \"scattered thinly along the southern rim of North American caribou distribution\" has been incorrectly classified. He affirms that the \"true woodland caribou is very rare, in very great difficulties and requires the most urgent of attention.\"In 2005, an analysis of mtDNA found differences between the caribou from Newfoundland, Labrador, southwestern Canada and southeastern Canada, but maintained all in R. t. caribou.Mallory and Hillis argued that, \"Although the taxonomic designations reflect evolutionary events, they do not appear to reflect current ecological conditions. In numerous instances, populations of the same subspecies have evolved different demographic and behavioural adaptations, while populations from separate subspecies have evolved similar demographic and behavioural patterns... \"[U]nderstanding ecotype in relation to existing ecological constraints and releases may be more important than the taxonomic relationships between populations.\"Current classifications of Rangifer tarandus, either with prevailing taxonomy on subspecies, designations based on ecotypes, or natural population groupings, fail to capture \"the variability of caribou across their range in Canada\" needed for effective species conservation and management. \"Across the range of a species, individuals may display considerable morphological, genetic, and behavioural variability reflective of both plasticity and adaptation to local environments.\" COSEWIC developed Designated Unit (DU) attribution to add to classifications already in use.\n\n\n== Subspecies ==\nThe canonical Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed.) recognises 14 subspecies, two of which are extinct.\nThe table above includes R. tarandus caboti (Labrador caribou), R. tarandus osborni (Osborn's caribou \u2013 from British Columbia) and R. tarandus terraenovae (Newfoundland caribou). Based on a review in 1961, these were considered invalid and included in R. tarandus caribou, but some recent authorities have considered them all valid, even suggesting that they are quite distinct. An analysis of mtDNA in 2005 found differences between the caribou from Newfoundland, Labrador, southwestern Canada and southeastern Canada, but maintained all in R. tarandus caribou.There are seven subspecies of reindeer in Eurasia, of which only two are found in Fennoscandia: the mountain reindeer (R. t. tarandus) in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia and the Finnish forest reindeer (R. t. fennicus) in Finland and Russia.Two subspecies are found only in North America: the Porcupine caribou (R. t. granti) and the Peary caribou (R. t. pearyi). The barren-ground caribou (R. t. groenlandicus) is found in western Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.According to Grubb, based on Banfield and considerably modified by Geist, these subspecies and divisions are considered valid: the caribou or woodland caribou division, which includes R. t. buskensis, R. t. caribou, R. t. dawsoni, R. t. fennicus, R. t. phylarchus and R. t. valentinae (R. t. osborni is a transitional subspecies between the caribou and tarandus divisions), the tarandus or tundra reindeer division, which includes R. t. caboti, R. t. groenlandicus, R. t. pearsoni, R. t. sibiricus and R. t. terraenovae and the platyrhynchus or dwarf reindeer division, which includes R. t. pearyi and R. t. platyrhynchus.\nSome of the Rangifer tarandus subspecies may be further divided by ecotype depending on several behavioural factors \u2013 predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling, woodland, woodland (boreal), woodland (migratory) or woodland (mountain), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration patterns (sedentary or migratory).The \"glacial-interglacial cycles of the upper Pleistocene had a major influence on the evolution\" of Rangifer tarandus and other Arctic and sub-Arctic species. Isolation of Rangifer tarandus in refugia during the last glacial \u2013 the Wisconsin in North America and the Weichselian in Eurasia-shaped \"intraspecific genetic variability\" particularly between the North American and Eurasian parts of the Arctic.\nIn 1986 Kurt\u00e9n reported that the oldest reindeer fossil was an \"antler of tundra reindeer type from the sands of S\u00fcssenborn\" in the Pleistocene (G\u00fcnz) period (680,000 to 620,000 BP). By the 4-W\u00fcrm period (110,000\u201370,000 to 12,000\u201310,000 BP) its European range was very extensive. Reindeer occurred in ... Spain, Italy and southern Russia. Reindeer [was] particularly abundant in the Magdalenian deposits from the late part of the 4-Wurm just before the end of the Ice Age: at that time and at the early Mesolithic it was the game animal for many tribes. The supply began to get low during the Mesolithic, when reindeer retired to the north.\n\"In spite of the great variation, all the Pleistocene and living reindeer belong to the same species.\"Humans started hunting reindeer in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods and humans are today the main predator in many areas. Norway and Greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer from the last glacial period until the present day. In the non-forested mountains of central Norway, such as Jotunheimen, it is still possible to find remains of stone-built trapping pits, guiding fences and bow rests, built especially for hunting reindeer. These can, with some certainty, be dated to the Migration Period, although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the Stone Age.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Antlers ===\n\nIn most populations both sexes grow antlers; the reindeer is the only cervid species in which females grow them as well as males. Androgens play essential role in cervids antler formation. The antlerogenic genes in reindeer have more sensitivity to androgens in comparison with other cervids.  There is considerable variation between subspecies in the size of the antlers (e.g. they are rather small and spindly in the northernmost subspecies), but on average the bull reindeer's antlers are the second largest of any extant deer, after the moose. In the largest subspecies, the antlers of large males can range up to 100 cm (39 in) in width and 135 cm (53 in) in beam length. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among living deer species. Antler size measured in number of points reflects the nutritional status of the reindeer and climate variation of its environment. The number of points on male reindeer increases from birth to five years of age and remains relatively constant from then on. \"In male caribou, antler mass (but not the number of tines) varies in concert with body mass.\" While antlers of bull woodland caribou are typically smaller than barren-ground caribou, they can be over one metre across. They are flattened, compact and relatively dense. Geist describes them as frontally emphasised, flat-beamed antlers. Woodland caribou antlers are thicker and broader than those of the barren-ground caribou and their legs and heads are longer. Quebec-Labrador bull caribou antlers can be significantly larger and wider than other woodland caribou. Central barren-ground bull caribou are perhaps the most diverse in configuration and can grow to be very high and wide. Mountain caribou are typically the most massive with the largest circumference measurements.The antlers' main beams begin at the brow \"extending posterior over the shoulders and bowing so that the tips point forward. The prominent, palmate brow tines extend forward, over the face.\" The antlers typically have two separate groups of points, lower and upper.\nAntlers begin to grow on male reindeer in March or April and on female reindeer in May or June. This process is called antlerogenesis. Antlers grow very quickly every year on the males. As the antlers grow, they are covered in thick velvet, filled with blood vessels and spongy in texture. The antler velvet of the barren-ground caribou and boreal woodland caribou is dark chocolate brown. The velvet that covers growing antlers is a highly vascularised skin. This velvet is dark brown on woodland or barren-ground caribou and slate-grey on Peary caribou and the Dolphin-Union caribou herd. Velvet lumps in March can develop into a rack measuring more than a metre in length (3 ft) by August.When the antler growth is fully grown and hardened, the velvet is shed or rubbed off. To the Inuit, for whom the caribou is a \"culturally important keystone species\", the months are named after landmarks in the caribou life cycle. For example, amiraijaut in the Igloolik region is \"when velvet falls off caribou antlers.\"Male reindeer use their antlers to compete with other males during the mating season. In describing woodland caribou, SARA wrote, \"During the rut, males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers. Large males with large antlers do most of the mating.\" Reindeer continue to migrate until the bull reindeer have spent the back fat.In late autumn or early winter after the rut, male reindeer lose their antlers, growing a new pair the next summer with a larger rack than the previous year. Female reindeer keep their antlers until they calve. In the Scandinavian populations, old males' antlers fall off in December, young males' fall off in the early spring and females' fall off in the summer.\nWhen bull reindeer shed their antlers in early to midwinter, the antlered female reindeer acquire the highest ranks in the feeding hierarchy, gaining access to the best forage areas. These cows are healthier than those without antlers. Calves whose mothers do not have antlers are more prone to disease and have a significantly higher mortality. Females in good nutritional condition, for example, during a mild winter with good winter range quality, may grow new antlers earlier as antler growth requires high intake.According to a respected Igloolik elder, Noah Piugaattuk, who was one of the last outpost camp leaders, caribou (tuktu) antlers\n...get detached every year\u2026 Young males lose the velvet from the antlers much more quickly than female caribou even though they are not fully mature. They start to work with their antlers just as soon as the velvet starts to fall off. The young males engage in fights with their antlers towards autumn\u2026soon after the velvet had fallen off they will be red, as they start to get bleached their colour changes\u2026 When the velvet starts to fall off the antler is red because the antler is made from blood. The antler is the blood that has hardened, in fact the core of the antler is still bloody when the velvet starts to fall off, at least close to the base.\nAccording to the Igloolik Oral History Project (IOHP), \"Caribou antlers provided the Inuit with a myriad of implements, from snow knives and shovels to drying racks and seal-hunting tools. A complex set of terms describes each part of the antler and relates it to its various uses\". Currently, the larger racks of antlers are used by Inuit as materials for carving. Iqaluit-based Jackoposie Oopakak's 1989 carving, entitled Nunali, which means \"\"place where people live\", and which is part of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada, includes a massive set of caribou antlers on which he has intricately carved the miniaturised world of the Inuit where \"Arctic birds, caribou, polar bears, seals, and whales are interspersed with human activities of fishing, hunting, cleaning skins, stretching boots, and travelling by dog sled and kayak...from the base of the antlers to the tip of each branch\".\n\n\n=== Pelt ===\nThe colour of the fur varies considerably, both between individuals and depending on season and subspecies. Northern populations, which usually are relatively small, are whiter, while southern populations, which typically are relatively large, are darker. This can be seen well in North America, where the northernmost subspecies, the Peary caribou, is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent, while the southernmost subspecies, the boreal woodland caribou, is the darkest and largest.The coat has two layers of fur: a dense woolly undercoat and longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs. Fur is the primary insulation factor that allows reindeer to regulate their core body temperature in relation to their environment, the thermogradient, even if the temperature rises to 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). In 1913 Dugmore noted how the woodland caribou swim so high out of the water, unlike any other mammal, because their hollow, \"air-filled, quill-like hair\" acts as a supporting \"life jacket.\"A darker belly color may be caused by two mutations of MC1R. They appear to be more common in domestic herds.\n\n\n=== Heat exchange ===\nBlood moving into the legs is cooled by blood returning to the body in a countercurrent heat exchange (CCHE), a highly efficient means of minimising heat loss through the skin's surface. In the CCHE mechanism, in cold weather, blood vessels are closely knotted and intertwined with arteries to the skin and appendages that carry warm blood with veins returning to the body that carry cold blood causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. In this way, their legs for example are kept cool, maintaining the core body temperature nearly 30 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) higher with less heat lost to the environment. Heat is thus recycled instead of being dissipated. The \"heart does not have to pump blood as rapidly in order to maintain a constant body core temperature and thus, metabolic rate.\" CCHE is present in animals like reindeer, fox and moose living in extreme conditions of cold or hot weather as a mechanism for retaining the heat in (or out of) the body. These are countercurrent exchange systems with the same fluid, usually blood, in a circuit, used for both directions of flow.Reindeer have specialised counter-current vascular heat exchange in their nasal passages. Temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control. Incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lungs and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the reindeer's breath is exhaled, then used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly be absorbed into the blood through the mucous membranes. Like moose, caribou have specialised noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils.\n\n\n=== Hooves ===\nThe reindeer has large feet with crescent-shaped, cloven hooves for walking in snow or swamps. According to the Species at Risk Public Registry (SARA), woodland\n\"Caribou have large feet with four toes. In addition to two small ones, called \"dew claws,\" they have two large, crescent-shaped toes that support most of their weight and serve as shovels when digging for food under snow. These large concave hooves offer stable support on wet, soggy ground and on crusty snow. The pads of the hoof change from a thick, fleshy shape in the summer to become hard and thin in the winter months, reducing the animal\u2019s exposure to the cold ground. Additional winter protection comes from the long hair between the \"toes\"; it covers the pads so the caribou walks only on the horny rim of the hooves.\"\nReindeer hooves adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as \"cratering\") through the snow to their favourite food, a lichen known as reindeer lichen (Cladonia rangiferina).\n\n\n=== Size ===\n\nThe females usually measure 162\u2013205 cm (64\u201381 in) in length and weigh 80\u2013120 kg (180\u2013260 lb). The males (or \"bulls\" as they are often called) are typically larger (to an extent which varies between the different subspecies), measuring 180\u2013214 cm (71\u201384 in) in length and usually weighing 159\u2013182 kg (351\u2013401 lb). Exceptionally large males have weighed as much as 318 kg (701 lb). Weight varies drastically between seasons, with males losing as much as 40% of their pre-rut weight.Shoulder height Is usually 85 to 150 cm (33 to 59 in), and the tail is 14 to 20 cm (5.5 to 7.9 in) long.\nThe reindeer from Svalbard are the smallest. They are also relatively short-legged and may have a shoulder height of as little as 80 cm (31 in), Norwegian Polar Institute.</ref thereby following Allen's rule.\n\n\n=== Clicking sound ===\nThe knees of many subspecies of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound as they walk. The sounds originate in the tendons of the knees and may be audible from ten meters away. The frequency of the knee-clicks is one of a range of signals that establish relative positions on a dominance scale among reindeer. \"Specifically, loud knee-clicking is discovered to be an honest signal of body size, providing an exceptional example of the potential for non-vocal acoustic communication in mammals.\" The clicking sound made by reindeer as they walk is caused by small tendons slipping over bone protuberances (sesamoid bones) in their feet. The sound is made when a reindeer is walking or running, occurring when the full weight of the foot is on the ground or just after it is relieved of the weight.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nA study by researchers from University College London in 2011 revealed that reindeer can see light with wavelengths as short as 320 nm (i.e. in the ultraviolet range), considerably below the human threshold of 400 nm. It is thought that this ability helps them to survive in the Arctic, because many objects that blend into the landscape in light visible to humans, such as urine and fur, produce sharp contrasts in ultraviolet. The tapetum lucidum of Arctic reindeer eyes changes in colour from gold in summer to blue in winter to improve their vision during times of continuous darkness, and perhaps enable them to better spot predators.\n\n\n== Biology and behaviour ==\n\n\n=== Seasonal body composition ===\n\nReindeer have developed adaptations for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months as well as for during cold months. The body composition of reindeer varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and non-breeding females between seasons. Breeding females have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than breeding females, as non-breeding females are able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both breeding and non-breeding females peaks in September. During the months of March through April, breeding females have more fat mass than the non-breeding females with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the breeding females.The environmental variations play a large part in reindeer nutrition, as winter nutrition is crucial to adult and neonatal survival rates. Lichens are a staple during the winter months as they are a readily available food source, which reduces the reliance on stored body reserves. Lichens are a crucial part of the reindeer diet; however, they are less prevalent in the diet of pregnant reindeer compared to non-pregnant individuals. The amount of lichen in a diet is found more in non-pregnant adult diets than pregnant individuals due to the lack of nutritional value. Although lichens are high in carbohydrates, they are lacking in essential proteins that vascular plants provide. The amount of lichen in a diet decreases in latitude, which results in nutritional stress being higher in areas with low lichen abundance.\n\n\n=== Reproduction and life-cycle ===\n\nReindeer mate in late September to early November and the gestation period is about 228\u2013234 days. During the mating season, males battle for access to females. Two males will lock each other's antlers together and try to push each other away. The most dominant males can collect as many as 15\u201320 females to mate with. A male will stop eating during this time and lose much of his body reserves.To calve, \"females travel to isolated, relatively predator-free areas such as islands in lakes, peatlands, lakeshores, or tundra.\" As females select the habitat for the birth of their calves, they are more wary than males. Dugmore noted that, in their seasonal migrations, the herd follows a doe for that reason. Newborns weigh on average 6 kg (13 lb). In May or June the calves are born. After 45 days, the calves are able to graze and forage, but continue suckling until the following autumn when they become independent from their mothers.Males live four years less than the females, whose maximum longevity is about 17 years. Females with a normal body size and who have had sufficient summer nutrition can begin breeding anytime between the ages of one to three years. When a female has undergone nutritional stress, it is possible for her to not reproduce for the year. Dominant males, those with larger body size and antler racks, inseminate more than one doe a season.\n\n\n=== Social structure, migration and range ===\n\nSome populations of North American caribou, for example many herds in the barren-ground caribou subspecies and some woodland caribou in Ungava and Labrador, migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal, travelling up to 5,000 km (3,000 mi) a year, and covering 1,000,000 km2 (400,000 sq mi). Other North American populations, the boreal woodland caribou for example, are largely sedentary. The European populations are known to have shorter migrations. Island herds such as the subspecies R. t. pearsoni and R. t. platyrhynchus make local movements. Migrating reindeer can be negatively affected by parasite loads. Severely infected individuals are weak and probably have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary between populations. Infections create an effect known as culling: infected migrating animals are less likely to complete the migration.Normally travelling about 19\u201355 km (12\u201334 mi) a day while migrating, the caribou can run at speeds of 60\u201380 km/h (37\u201350 mph). Young caribou can already outrun an Olympic sprinter when only a day old. During the spring migration smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of 50,000 to 500,000 animals, but during autumn migrations the groups become smaller and the reindeer begin to mate. During winter, reindeer travel to forested areas to forage under the snow. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds. A reindeer can swim easily and quickly, normally at about 6.5 km/h (4 mph) but, if necessary, at 10 km/h (6 mph) and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river.\n\nAs an adaptation to their Arctic environment, they have lost their circadian rhythm.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Distribution and habitat ===\n\nOriginally, the reindeer was found in Scandinavia, eastern Europe, Greenland, Russia, Mongolia and northern China north of the 50th latitude. In North America, it was found in Canada, Alaska, and the northern conterminous USA from Washington to Maine. In the 19th century, it was apparently still present in southern Idaho. Even in historical times, it probably occurred naturally in Ireland. During the late Pleistocene era, reindeer occurred as far south as Nevada and Tennessee in North America and as far south as Spain in Europe. Today, wild reindeer have disappeared from these areas, especially from the southern parts, where it vanished almost everywhere. Large populations of wild reindeer are still found in Norway, Finland, Siberia, Greenland, Alaska and Canada.\nAccording to the Grubb (2005), Rangifer tarandus is \"circumboreal in the tundra and taiga\" from \"Svalbard, Norway, Finland, Russia, Alaska (USA) and Canada including most Arctic islands, and Greenland, south to northern Mongolia, China (Inner Mongolia; now only domesticated or feral?), Sakhalin Island, and USA (Northern Idaho and the Great Lakes region). Reindeer were introduced to, and feral in, Iceland, Kerguelen Islands, South Georgia Island, Pribilof Islands, St. Matthew Island.\"There is strong regional variation in Rangifer herd size. There are large population differences among individual herds and the size of individual herds has varied greatly since 1970. The largest of all herds (in Taimyr, Russia) has varied between 400,000 and 1,000,000; the second largest herd (at the George River in Canada) has varied between 28,000 and 385,000.\nWhile Rangifer is a widespread and numerous genus in the northern Holarctic, being present in both tundra and taiga (boreal forest), by 2013, many herds had \"unusually low numbers\" and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be. Caribou and reindeer numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range. This global decline is linked to climate change for northern migratory herds and industrial disturbance of habitat for non-migratory herds. Barren-ground caribou are susceptible to the effects of climate change due to a mismatch in the phenological process, between the availability of food during the calving period.\n In November 2016, it was reported that more than 81,000 reindeer in Russia had died as a result of climate change. Longer autumns leading to increased amounts of freezing rain created a few inches of ice over lichen, starving many reindeer.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\n\nReindeer are ruminants, having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat lichens in winter, especially reindeer lichen \u2013 a unique adaptation among mammals \u2013 they are the only large mammal able to metabolise lichen owing to specialised bacteria and protozoa in their gut. They are the only animals (except for some gastropods) in which the enzyme lichenase, which breaks down lichenin to glucose, has been found. However, they also eat the leaves of willows and birches, as well as sedges and grasses. \nThey have been known to eat their own fallen antlers, probably for calcium. There is also some evidence to suggest that on occasion, especially in the spring when they are nutritionally stressed, they will feed on small rodents (such as lemmings), fish (such as Arctic char), and bird eggs. Reindeer herded by the Chukchis have been known to devour mushrooms enthusiastically in late summer.During the Arctic summer, when there is continuous daylight, reindeer change their sleeping pattern from one synchronised with the sun to an ultradian pattern in which they sleep when they need to digest food.\n\n\n=== Predators ===\n\nA variety of predators prey heavily on reindeer, including overhunting by people in some areas, which contributes to the decline of populations.Golden eagles prey on calves and are the most prolific hunter on the calving grounds. Wolverines will take newborn calves or birthing cows, as well as (less commonly) infirm adults.\nBrown bears and polar bears prey on reindeer of all ages, but like the wolverines they are most likely to attack weaker animals, such as calves and sick reindeer, since healthy adult reindeer can usually outpace a bear. The grey wolf is the most effective natural predator of adult reindeer and sometimes takes large numbers, especially during the winter. Some wolf packs as well as individual grizzly bears in Canada may follow and live off of a particular reindeer herd year round.Additionally, as carrion, reindeer may be scavenged opportunistically by foxes, hawks and ravens.\nBloodsucking insects, such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), black flies (Simuliidae), and botflies and deer botflies (Oestridae, specifically, the reindeer warble fly (Hypoderma tarandi) and the reindeer nose botfly (Cephenemyia trompe)), are a plague to reindeer during the summer and can cause enough stress to inhibit feeding and calving behaviours. An adult reindeer will lose perhaps about 1 liter (about 2 US pints) of blood to biting insects for every week it spends in the tundra. The population numbers of some of these predators is influenced by the migration of reindeer. Tormenting insects keep caribou on the move searching for windy areas like hilltops and mountain ridges, rock reefs, lakeshore and forest openings, or snow patches that offer respite from the buzzing horde. Gathering in large herds is another strategy that caribou use to block insects.In one case, the entire body of a reindeer was found in the stomach of a Greenland shark, a species found in the far northern Atlantic, although this was possibly a case of scavenging, considering the dissimilarity of habitats between the ungulate and the large, slow-moving fish.\n\n\n=== Other threats ===\nWhite-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm, a nematode parasite that causes reindeer, moose (Alces alces), elk (Cervus canadensis), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to develop fatal neurological symptoms which include a loss of fear of humans. White-tailed deer that carry this worm are partly immune to it.Changes in climate and habitat beginning in the twentieth century have expanded range overlap between white-tailed deer and caribou, increasing the frequency of infection within the reindeer population. This increase in infection is a concern for wildlife managers. Human activities, such as \"clear-cutting forestry practices, forest fires, and the clearing for agriculture, roadways, railways, and power lines,\" favour the conversion of habitats into the preferred habitat of the white-tailed deer-\"open forest interspersed with meadows, clearings, grasslands, and riparian flatlands.\"\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\n\n=== Current status ===\nWhile overall widespread and numerous, some subspecies are rare and at least one has already gone extinct. As of 2015, the IUCN has classified the reindeer as Vulnerable due to an observed population decline of 40% over the last \u224825 years. According to IUCN, Rangifer tarandus as a species is not endangered because of its overall large population and its widespread range.In North America, R. t. dawsoni is extinct, R. t. pearyi is endangered, R. t. caribou is designated as threatened and some individual populations are endangered. While the subspecies R. t. granti and R. t. groenlandicus are not designated as threatened, many individual herds\u2014including some of the largest\u2014are declining and there is much concern at the local level.Rangifer tarandus is \"endangered in Canada in regions such as south-east British Columbia at the Canadian-USA border, along the Columbia, Kootenay and Kootenai rivers and around Kootenay Lake. Rangifer tarandus is endangered in the United States in Idaho and Washington.\nThere is strong regional variation in Rangifer herd size, By 2013 many caribou herds in North America had \"unusually low numbers\" and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be. Caribou numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range. There are many factors contributing to the decline in numbers.\n\n\n=== Boreal woodland caribou (COSEWIC designation as threatened) ===\nOngoing human development of their habitat has caused populations of woodland caribou to disappear from their original southern range. In particular, caribou were extirpated in many areas of eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century. Woodland caribou were designated as threatened in 2002. Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34,000 boreal woodland caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada (Environment Canada, 2011b). Professor Marco Musiani of the University of Calgary said in a statement that \"The woodland caribou is already an endangered species in southern Canada and the United States....[The] warming of the planet means the disappearance of their critical habitat in these regions. Caribou need undisturbed lichen-rich environments and these types of habitats are disappearing.\"Woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as threatened in 2002 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, (COSEWIC). Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34\u2009000 boreal woodland caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada.(Environment Canada, 2011b). \"According to Geist, the \"woodland caribou is highly endangered throughout its distribution right into Ontario.\"In 2002 the Atlantic-Gasp\u00e9sie population of the woodland caribou was designated as endangered by COSEWIC. The small isolated population of 200 animals was at risk from predation and habitat loss.\n\n\n=== Peary caribou (COSEWIC designation as endangered) ===\nIn 1991 COSEWIC assigned \"endangered status\" to the Banks Island and High Arctic populations of Peary caribou. The Low Arctic population of Peary caribou was designated as threatened. By 2004 all three were designated as \"endangered.\"\nNumbers have declined by about 72% over the last three generations, mostly because of catastrophic die-off likely related to severe icing episodes. The ice covers the vegetation and caribou starve. Voluntary restrictions on hunting by local people are in place, but have not stopped population declines. Because of the continuing decline and expected changes in long-term weather patterns, this subspecies is at imminent risk of extinction.\n\n\n== Relationship with humans ==\n\nThe reindeer has an important economic role for all circumpolar peoples, including the Saami, the Nenets, the Khants, the Evenks, the Yukaghirs, the Chukchi and the Koryaks in Eurasia. It is believed that domestication started between the Bronze and Iron Ages. Siberian reindeer owners also use the reindeer to ride on (Siberian reindeer are larger than their Scandinavian relatives). For breeders, a single owner may own hundreds or even thousands of animals. The numbers of Russian reindeer herders have been drastically reduced since the fall of the Soviet Union. The sale of fur and meat is an important source of income. Reindeer were introduced into Alaska near the end of the 19th century; they interbred with the native caribou subspecies there. Reindeer herders on the Seward Peninsula have experienced significant losses to their herds from animals (such as wolves) following the wild caribou during their migrations.Reindeer meat is popular in the Scandinavian countries. Reindeer meatballs are sold canned. Saut\u00e9ed reindeer is the best-known dish in S\u00e1pmi. In Alaska and Finland, reindeer sausage is sold in supermarkets and grocery stores. Reindeer meat is very tender and lean. It can be prepared fresh, but also dried, salted and hot- and cold-smoked. In addition to meat, almost all of the internal organs of reindeer can be eaten, some being traditional dishes. Furthermore, Lapin Poron liha, fresh reindeer meat completely produced and packed in Finnish S\u00e1pmi, is protected in Europe with PDO classification.Reindeer antlers are powdered and sold as an aphrodisiac, or as an nutritional or medicinal supplement, to Asian markets.\nThe blood of the caribou was supposedly mixed with alcohol as drink by hunters and loggers in colonial Quebec to counter the cold. This drink is now enjoyed without the blood as a wine and whiskey drink known as Caribou.\n\n\n=== Reindeer and indigenous peoples ===\nWild reindeer are still hunted in Greenland and in North America. In the traditional lifestyle of the Inuit people, the Northern First Nations people, the Alaska Natives, and the Kalaallit of Greenland, reindeer is an important source of food, clothing, shelter and tools.\n\nThe Caribou Inuit are inland-dwelling Inuit in present-day Nunavut's Keewatin Region, Canada, now known as the Kivalliq Region. They subsisted on caribou year-round, eating dried caribou meat in the winter. The Ihalmiut are caribou Inuit that followed the Qamanirjuaq barren-ground caribou herd.There is an Inuit saying in the Kivalliq Region:\nThe caribou feeds the wolf, but it is the wolf who keeps the caribou strong.\nElder Chief of Koyukuk and chair for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group Benedict Jones, or K\u2019ughto\u2019oodenool\u2019o\u2019, represents the Middle Yukon River, Alaska. His grandmother was a member of the Caribou Clan, who travelled with the caribou as a means to survive. In 1939, they were living the traditional life style at one of their hunting camps in Koyukuk near the location of what is now the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge. His grandmother made a pair of new mukluks in one day. K\u2019ughto\u2019oodenool\u2019o\u2019 recounted a story told by an elder, who \"worked on the steamboats during the gold rush days out on the Yukon.\" In late August the caribou migrated from the Alaska Range up north to Huslia, Koyukuk and the Tanana area. One year when the steamboat was unable to continue they ran into a caribou herd numbering estimated at a million animals, migrating across Yukon. \"They tied up for seven days waiting for the caribou to cross. They ran out of wood for the steamboats, and had to go back down 40 miles to the wood pile to pick up some more wood. On the tenth day, they came back and they said there was still caribou going across the river night and day.\"The Gwich'in, the indigenous people of northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska, have been dependent on the international migratory Porcupine caribou herd for millennia. To them caribou\u2014vadzaih\u2014is the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the Gwich'in, just as the buffalo is to the Plains Indians. Innovative language revitalisation projects are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger Gwich'in speakers. In one project lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwich\u2019in elder Kenneth Frank works with linguists which include young Gwich'in speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy. The main goal of the research, was to \"elicit not only what the Gwich'in know about caribou anatomy, but how they see caribou and what they say and believe about caribou that defines themselves, their dietary and nutritional needs, and their subsistence way of life.\" Elders have identified at least 150 descriptive Gwich'in names for all of the bones, organs and tissues. Associated with the caribou's anatomy are not just descriptive Gwich'in names for all of the body parts including bones, organs, and tissues, but also \"an encyclopedia of stories, songs, games, toys, ceremonies, traditional tools, skin clothing, personal names and surnames, and a highly developed ethnic cuisine.\"In the 1980s, Gwich'in Traditional Management Practices were established to protect the Porcupine caribou, upon which the Gwich'in people depend. They \"codified traditional principles of caribou management into tribal law\" which include \"limits on the harvest of caribou and procedures to be followed in processing and transporting caribou meat\" and limits on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip.\n\n\n=== Reindeer husbandry ===\n\nThe reindeer is the only domesticated deer in the world, though it may be more accurate to consider reindeer as semi-domesticated. Reindeer in northern Fennoscandia (northern Norway, Sweden and Finland) as well in the Kola Peninsula and Yakutia in Russia, are all semi-wild domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus f. domesticus), ear-marked by their owners. Some reindeer in the area are truly domesticated, mostly used as draught animals (nowadays commonly for tourist entertainment and races, traditionally important for the nomadic S\u00e1mi). Domesticated reindeer have also been used for milk, e.g. in Norway.\nThere are only two genetically pure populations of wild reindeer in Northern Europe: wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) that live in central Norway, with a population in 2007 of between 6,000 and 8,400 animals; and wild Finnish forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) that live in central and eastern Finland and in Russian Karelia, with a population of about 4,350, plus 1,500 in Arkhangelsk and 2,500 in Komi.DNA analysis indicates that reindeer were independently domesticated in Fennoscandia and Western Russia (and possibly Eastern Russia). Reindeer have been herded for centuries by several Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples, including the Sami, the Nenets and the Yakuts. They are raised for their meat, hides and antlers and, to a lesser extent, for milk and transportation. Reindeer are not considered fully domesticated, as they generally roam free on pasture grounds. In traditional nomadic herding, reindeer herders migrate with their herds between coastal and inland areas according to an annual migration route and herds are keenly tended. However, reindeer were not bred in captivity, though they were tamed for milking as well as for use as draught animals or beasts of burden. Domesticated reindeer are shorter-legged and heavier than their wild counterparts.The use of reindeer for transportation is common among the nomadic peoples of northern Russia (but not anymore in Scandinavia). Although a sled drawn by 20 reindeer will cover no more than 20\u201325 km a day (compared to 7\u201310 km on foot, 70\u201380 km by a dog sled loaded with cargo and 150\u2013180 km by a dog sled without cargo), it has the advantage that the reindeer will discover their own food, while a pack of 5\u20137 sled dogs requires 10\u201314 kg of fresh fish a day.The use of reindeer as semi-domesticated livestock in Alaska was introduced in the late 19th century by the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, with assistance from Sheldon Jackson, as a means of providing a livelihood for Native peoples there. Reindeer were imported first from Siberia and later also from Norway. A regular mail run in Wales, Alaska, used a sleigh drawn by reindeer. In Alaska, reindeer herders use satellite telemetry to track their herds, using online maps and databases to chart the herd's progress.Domesticated reindeer are mostly found in northern Fennoscandia and Russia, with a herd of approximately 150\u2013170 reindeer living around the Cairngorms region in Scotland. The last remaining wild tundra reindeer in Europe are found in portions of southern Norway. The International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry (ICR), a circumpolar organisation, was established in 2005 by the Norwegian government. ICR represents over 20 indigenous reindeer peoples and about 100,000 reindeer herders in 9 different national states. In Finland, there are about 6,000 reindeer herders, most of whom keep small herds of less than 50 reindeer to raise additional income. With 185,000 reindeer (2001), the industry produces 2,000 tons of reindeer meat and generates 35 million euros annually. 70% of the meat is sold to slaughterhouses. Reindeer herders are eligible for national and EU agricultural subsidies, which constituted 15% of their income. Reindeer herding is of central importance for the local economies of small communities in sparsely populated rural S\u00e1pmi.Currently, many reindeer herders are heavily dependent on diesel fuel to provide for electric generators and snowmobile transportation, although solar photovoltaic systems can be used to reduce diesel dependency.\n\n\n=== In history ===\nReindeer hunting by humans has a very long history and wild reindeer \"may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting.\"Both Aristotle and Theophrastus have short accounts \u2013 probably based on the same source \u2013 of an ox-sized deer species, named tarandos, living in the land of the Bodines in Scythia, which was able to change the colour of its fur to obtain camouflage. The latter is probably a misunderstanding of the seasonal change in reindeer fur colour. The descriptions have been interpreted as being of reindeer living in the southern Ural Mountains in c. 350 BC\n\nA deer-like animal described by Julius Caesar in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (chapter 6.26) from the Hercynian Forest in the year 53 BC is most certainly to be interpreted as reindeer:\nThere is an ox shaped like a stag. In the middle of its forehead a single horn grows between its ears, taller and straighter than the animal horns with which we are familiar. At the top this horn spreads out like the palm of a hand or the branches of a tree. The females are of the same form as the males, and their horns are the same shape and size.\nAccording to Olaus Magnus's Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus \u2013 printed in Rome in 1555 \u2013 Gustav I of Sweden sent 10 reindeer to Albert I, Duke of Prussia, in the year 1533. It may be these animals that Conrad Gessner had seen or heard of.\nDuring World War II, the Soviet Army used reindeer as pack animals to transport food, ammunition and post from Murmansk to the Karelian front and bring wounded soldiers, pilots and equipment back to the base. About 6,000 reindeer and more than 1,000 reindeer herders were part of the operation. Most herders were Nenets, who were mobilised from the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, but reindeer herders from Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and Komi also participated.\n\n\n=== Santa Claus's reindeer ===\n\nAround the world, public interest in reindeer peaks in the Christmas period. According to folklore, Santa Claus's sleigh is pulled by flying reindeer. These were first named in the 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\", where they are called Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Dunder, and Blixem. Dunder was later changed to Donder and\u2014in other works\u2014Donner (in German, \"thunder\") and Blixem was later changed to Bliksem, then Blitzen (blitz being German for \"lightning\"). Some consider Rudolph as part of the group as well, though he was not part of the original named work referenced previously. Rudolph was added by Robert L. May in 1939 in his book Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n\n\n=== In mythology and art ===\nAmong the Inuit, there is a story of the origin of the caribou,\nOnce upon a time there were no caribou on the earth. But there was a man who wished for caribou, and he cut a hole deep in the ground, and up this hole came caribou, many caribou. The caribou came pouring out, until the earth was almost covered with them. And when the man thought there were caribou enough for mankind, he closed up the hole again. Thus the caribou came up on earth.\nInuit artists from the barren lands, incorporate depictions of caribou\u2014and items made from caribou antlers and skin\u2014in carvings, drawings, prints and sculpture.\nContemporary Canadian artist Brian Jungen's, of Dunne-za First Nations ancestry, commissioned an installation entitled \"The ghosts on top of my head\" (2010\u201311) in Banff, Alberta, which depicts the antlers of caribou, elk and moose.\nI remember a story my Uncle Jack told me \u2013 a Dunne-Za creation story about how animals once ruled the earth and were ten times their size and that got me thinking about scale and using the idea of the antler, which is a thing that everyone is scared of, and making it into something more approachable and abstract.\nTomson Highway, CM is a Canadian and Cree playwright, novelist, and children's author, who was born in a remote area north of Brochet, Manitoba. His father, Joe Highway, was a caribou hunter. His 2001 children's book entitled Caribou Song/at\u00edhko n\u00edkamon was selected as one of the \"Top 10 Children\u2019s Books\" by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. The young protagonists of Caribou Song, like Tomson himself, followed the caribou herd with their families.\n\n\n=== Heraldry and symbols ===\nSeveral Norwegian municipalities have one or more reindeer depicted in their coats-of-arms: Eidfjord, Porsanger, Rendalen, Troms\u00f8, Vads\u00f8 and V\u00e5g\u00e5. The historic province of V\u00e4sterbotten in Sweden has a reindeer in its coat of arms. The present V\u00e4sterbotten County has very different borders and uses the reindeer combined with other symbols in its coat-of-arms. The city of Pite\u00e5 also has a reindeer. The logo for Ume\u00e5 University features three reindeer.The Canadian 25-cent coin, or \"quarter\" features a depiction of a caribou on one face. The caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut. A caribou statue was erected at the centre of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, marking the spot in France where hundreds of soldiers from Newfoundland were killed and wounded in World War I and there is a replica in Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland's capital city.Two municipalities in Finland have reindeer motifs in their coats-of-arms: Kuusamo has a running reindeer and Inari has a fish with reindeer antlers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRangifer (constellation)\nRangifer (journal)\nReindeer Police\n\n\n=== Parasites ===\nHypoderma tarandi\nCephenemyia trompe\nParelaphostrongylus tenuis\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"Designatable Units for Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Canada\" (PDF).

          "It was an impressive experience to get in touch with the reindeers and feed them. But the time in the Sami tipi, when a young Sami woman talked about Sami culture, was even more impressive and interesting. I and my wife really enjoyed the trip and we can recommend this activity",

          "We had a fantastic morning tour with Tromso Arctic Reindeer! I would highly recommend this tour to everyone. From our own experience it is better to go at 10 am - you will have perfect light for pictures, it will be not that cold like in the evening plus on the way back you can",
          "I was on a singles group tour to Troms\u00f8 which included husky sledding and the possibility of viewing the Aurora Borealis, but wanted to see reindeer and learn about Sami culture too. I\u2019d therefore booked this experience online well in advance for our \u2018free\u2019 day. The first thing",
          "Amazing experience with these beautiful animals. Short trip by bus from Tromso city centre. On arrival a very warm greeting from the Sami people. We were taken through to the paddocks and each given a small bucket to feed the reindeer. Large heated tents close by so, if needed,",

          "I really enjoyed this tour, you set of from Tromso by coach to the location. When you get there you all go into the tent where the Sami women told us what we would be doing during the trip and where everything was. After about 10 minutes we went outside to meet and feed the",

          "This tour was run very professionally and the guides were friendly and helpful. We were taken to the Sami camp where there was a herd of just over 300 reindeer. In groups we were installed on the sledges pulled by the reindeer and were then given the opportunity to feed them.",
          "The transfer was good organized, but it was a big group. The three course menu was more a fake then a good dinner. The sledding trip was only 15 minutes and there was no time to look for northern lights. We wouldn't book it again.",
          "Enjoyed the Sami culture part and feeding the reindeers. Bit cold waiting for sleigh ride as large group was split into 3 sleigh trips. Northern lights appeared at the end but coach was waiting so had to rush.",
          "A truly memorable experience. The Tromso Safari staff, drivers and Sami people were very friendly and knowledgable. They gave a great insight into the history of the Sami lifestyle and also the herd of reindeer that are integral to their way of life.",
          "Our kids had a blast! We had fun too. The food was good, and the Sami culture talk was fun. But the reindeer feeding was just fantastic. They had a car seat and booster in the van that transported us, too!",
          "I'm not an animal person - my girlfriend on the other hand is a freak when it coms to nature. She purchased the tickets and is currently making me write this review. That being said, I really liked this experience. The way they set everything up, with the transitions, and",
          "Very glad we booked this, it was such a great insight to the Sami culture and the reindeer were lovely! We had a lot of fun feeding the reindeer, you can also feed them directly out of your hand since they are very gentle. They had a few huts with fires going that had",
          "I absolutely loved this experience, it was my favorite part of visiting Troms\u00f8. Overall, there was a very nice and relaxed atmosphere about it, which I think is great both for visitors and for the reindeer! The feeding and sleigh ride were great, and the talk about Sami culture",

          "After having read some of the excellent reviews, we were left wondering if we were indeed on the same tour. Our advice for anyone looking to book is to think carefully about what else you could purchase for the same money. The reindeer sledding is described as \"thrilling\" . Our",

          "Most underwhelming part of my Troms\u00f8 trip. I am unsure how it has such a good review on trip advisor, makes me wonder if I can trust it anymore. Did not feel authentic at all, it felt like a tourist trap, pack people in to make profit, was not personal and members of staff",
          "Very enjoyable morning with reindeers,short sledding/meal and talk on aspects of sami culture. Only negative was the use of paper plates + cups. What a pity, let's go back to delph!",
          "We loved the reindeers, so gentle, funny and curious animals, and also to know about the Sami people. We were very welcome by this family and, although they receive a lot of people everyday, they were very warm and available to talk about their way of living with us. it is so",

          "Absolutely wonderful experience! The staff (Jenny in particular) were so friendly and welcoming, everything was well-planned and efficient, and the experience was absolutely magical. While there were quite a few people on the tour (around 120, I think), it didn\u2019t feel crowded at",
          "Amazing opportunity to meet the Sami reindeer herders and learn about their lifestyles. Feeding the reindeer was a lot of fun, and we later learned they are in fact wild reindeer. The Sami move them from the mountains to the camp during the winter to help them survive harsh",
          "We had a great time with the reindeers and the team. The sami-story from an authentic sami was an extraordinary experience. evan the food was delicious. And first of all, we where very happy that the animal are kept in an healthy environment. I know, the tour was for tourists,",
          "Many reindeers will get close to you after you holding the basket of food! And the food and drinks they provided are very nice. The atmosphere and the environment are very satisfying.",
          "On the day of our visit there was Arctic storm which we faced..but the arrangements were so nice that we could complete the visit without Reindeer slegging which was cancelled due to climate condition...but the message of refund came immediately... Samu culture was explained",
          "We booked up for the Reindeer Feeding and Sami culture and it was a great experience The Sami people are very friendly and we felt extremely welcome. We started off by feeding and interacting with their reindeer. There was a small cabin set up with a log fire, warm drinks and",

          "We spent 8 days in Tromso, primarily to chase the Northern Lights. We booked this reindeer sleigh excursion as an easy day excursion. It was low on our must-do list. We expected the sleigh ride to be the highlight, but it was actually the feeding/interacting with so many",
          "Getting closer to the reindeers was great. There's an enourmous open space and you just walk among hundreds of reindeers. They are usually calm, but you can expect some bullies as well. The presentation of the sami culture and their way of living was very interesting. We learnt",
          "The experience is so great. You get to feed almost 300 reindeers and they are so cute and friendly. Also I had the experience of the sledding for half and hour, I would recomend only 15 minutes, is just enough to get the expirience. Yo also get to know all about Sami culture in",

          "It was an easy journey to the meet point and everything went smoothly. There were lots of reindeers. We had the first feeding while others went on their reindeer rides. We ended up going on our short rides last and by that time, I was pretty frozen so the 5 minute ride was",

The Sami people were beautiful and so is their culture. The reindeer\u2019s were lovely and very well behaved. The best thing was riding in",
          "We were very lucky and got to see an amazing display of Northern Lights after dinner. The reindeer sledding was very peaceful and enjoyable. The reindeer feeding was interesting and you could participate as much or as little as you were comfortable with. The food was good and",
          "I enjoyed my time with the reindeer as well as listening to the Sami stories and practicing some lassoing, even if in Texas we have a different style of lassoing the Sami way was ok too. The food was excellent. It was a fun experience and I would do it again, I think I would",
          "Booked the nightsledding, with dinner & Sami culture evening and chance of Northern Lights. The reindeer encounter & feeding was scary. Should have skipped that, not the reindeers fault.. animals are animals. The sleighride was exactly 10 minutes. To the second. The group before",
          "Such a great experience, kids loved feeding and patting the reindeer. A cosy cabin to go to if you needed a break from the cold with hot chocolate and cookies. Great reindeer ride and nice lunch in a traditional Sami building. Staff were friendly and helpful. We loved the Sami",
          "A great half-day tour which I can definitely recommend. One has a lot of time to feed and pet the reindeers and you can always warm up and get cookies, coffee, tea or warm chocolate in one of the tents. The sledding tour takes about 10-15 minutes and you get a nice panoramic",
          "We had a great time completing the long reindeer sledding and feeding. Spent a little over a half hour being pulled around on sleds by the reindeer and then some time feeding the reindeer. This was followed by lunch and a session on the Sami culture. The reindeer stew was",
          "We went on a beautiful winter\u2019s day and loved meeting the raindeer, feeding them and walking around in the snowy meadows. We also went sleighing but that was a slow and unexciting experience. The stories we heard about the Sami culture, the beautiful joik, the raindeer stew we",

          "Overall the day was very nice and relaxing. You had plenty of time to walk around in nature and interact with the reindeers. Lunch was also provided and a short session about Sami culture. 4 star rather than 5 star review was due to the cost. Considering your were basically",

          "The experience was ok but they booked way too many people for where we went (two coach buses) so it didn\u2019t feel the way it was shown on the picture. Too crowded! Also, the title says chance of seeing northern lights and this was not even mentioned throughout the tour. I know it",
          "Nice experience to feed the reindeers. Also a good way to learn something about the Sami culture as well since they will explain this also. A great experience I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to miss out on.",

          "The best part of this experience was getting to feed the reindeer. If you are looking for a fast ride on the sled, this isn\u2019t the one for you. All they did was walk us in a really big circle. But when we got to feed them from our hands, that was awesome. Afterward, getting to",

          "Awesome experience! I have a 14 year old, 9 year old and 3 year old that loved the experience. Plenty of time walking around and feeding the reindeer, and great history behind the Sami culture. The reindeer soup is great and for those that are skeptical, they have a vegetarian",
          "I think most will agree that it's not every day you get to feed hundreds of reindeer against the backdrop of gorgeous, snow-capped mountains. The Sami guides were great and allowed unlimited refills of food for us to feed the *very* hungry and friendly reindeer. This was",
          "This was a lovely morning tour. The camp is in a very picturesque place surrounded by mountains and water. There were a few hundred Reindeer and even just the sight of all the reindeer with the winter backdrop was lovely. The kids loved feeding the deer and there was an hour or",

          "The Sami and reindeer camp is about 30-45 mins away from the city center of Tromso. The guides and the Sami people were very kind and welcoming. Feeding the reindeer and the talk about the sami culture was an amazing and interesting experience. The sledding was nice but 15 mins",
          "Highly recommend this activity. Not only do you get the feed these 300 gentle reindeers (though not when they were hustling for food), you also get to understand the Sami culture. The tour agents are also responsible in the sense that they follow up on the bookings. We thought",
          "We liked the experience of feeding the reindeers, en eating in the cosey tent. Also we liked the stories of the sami. But the food was really simple and not so good , and the sledding was kind of a joke because you just go around a circle around the tent. So we think it is to",

          "It was an amazing experience! This is a perfect trip wether you are by yourself, going with a friend, partner or family. Reindeer are use to people feeding them and they are so many that it doesn't matter if you are going with a big group you will have time to feed them as long",
          "What an experience! The Sami people were so warm and accommodating, and their reindeer stew is to die for! The whole experience was packed with interesting activities, such as learning to lasso, feeding the reindeer, going for a sled ride, learning about Sami culture, and",

          "The departure from the hotel seemed quite well organised. We were two coachloads of people though, which put me off a bit, as I prefer small groups, but once we got to the reindeer park (15 min), the area was large, so it didn't actually feel crowded at all. I did the long",
          "We had a specially booked evening tour in late March, so it was still full winter. We experienced a reindeer sled ride in freshly falling snow, a hearty stew dinner in a tepee and got to feed the reindeer. This was truly unique.",
          "I promise not to post all 500 pictures of the reindeer, but I seriously took about 500 photos. They were so cute! Anyway, the reindeer feeding and Sami Culture tour was great. To be honest though, it's going to be what you make of it. They manage a lot of people at one time",
          "This was truly an amazing experience and one I would recommend everyone to do while in Troms\u00f8! You get picked up by very friendly staff and driven all the way out to the camp. At the camp you meet even more very friendly staff and get instructions about what that will happen",
          "My partner and I went on the Sami reindeer experience which included feeding the reindeer, sledding and lunch. We thoroughly enjoyed the day meeting the herd and people and learning about the Sami culture-fascinating. Transfer from Tromso was easy and the lunch was very tasty.",
          "Nice staff .....it was good experience about feeding and the view was wonderful .....the soup was okay too",
          "We did the night tour and really enjoyed ourselves. It was cold but they provide warm blankets for on the sled and the inside of the wooden yurt is warm and toasty with big fires and lots of warm food and drink. It was really romantic! All the staff were very nice and helpful,",
          "If you love hairy and cute animal,this activity is perfect for you. It was our first time, the staffs were all so friendly. Reindeer sled were kind of slow, not as fast as husky sled though, so in winter, we chose the short time sledding. While waiting for the sled, they served",
          "We took our 3 year on this day tour and we had an amazing time! Our bus guide, Fernando, was so kind and sweet to our daughter, she loved him. The ride was short and smooth and once we arrived, everything was coordinated nicely. We loved everything from the lunch, to the hot",
          "Good experience up close with reindeers, got the chance to feed and sledding as never have this kind of chance in Asia. Learn about interesting Sami culture. Even thought us to sing a Sami song. Once a lifetime experience with the reindeers and beautiful landscape of Troms\u00f8.",
          "Nous avons pass\u00e9 un merveilleux moment. Tr\u00e8s bonne \u00e9quipe dont des Saami heureux de partager leur culture, 350 rennes, excursion en petit comit\u00e9.

          "I had originally signed up for the Night Sledding excursion but due to availability was switched to a daytime experience. The owners/staff were more than accommodating by providing private transportation from the airport, extended personal time with the reindeer (because",
          "Reindeers are cute and very nice. We could spend whole day there (the trip was for half a day). Sami culture was also surprisingly good - the lady was doing a great job. The lunch was a simple reindeer stew, with no add-ons like bread etc. Overall highly recommended. Reindeers",
          "We were on a cruise, but had booked this tour independently. Well worth it. We were picked up at a hotel close to the pier and transported to the site. We got there at dusk and were introduced to the Sami owner. We were then given a bucket of food pellets to feed the",
          "When visiting Tromso, YOU HAVE to do this tour; it was worth every single penny and you make memories for a lifetime. We did this on a first full day here and had an absolutely fabulous time at Tromso Arctic Reindeer! We were so lucky to have the sunshine during our time in the",
          "My sister and I did this tour in Troms\u00f8. It was magical. First was a talk to overview what we would be doing. Then, we got buckets of feed, and the reindeer came running. Next, a meal in the hut. Then a reindeer sled ride. We also had a talk about the Sami culture. It was",
          "It was lots of fun feeding the reindeer and going for a reindeer ride. Learning about the Sami culture was really interesting and the Sami reindeer herder did a great job telling us about Sami culture - I could have listen even more because he was fun and informative. The food",
          "We absolutely recommend this tour! The company is great, highly organized and has some amazing guides. A special thank you to Martin as he is very enthusiastic and so patient to answer all our questions. We spent a lot of time with the reindeers and we were free to move around",
          "This was such an amazing experience, we got to learn so much about Sami Culture and reindeers! The hosts were all so nice and helpful. We got to feed the cute reindeers who were so friendly! The stew was so delicious and warm, this is a must do if you\u2019re in Troms\u00f8.",
          "We had such an amazing experience with Tromso Arctic Reindeer! I must admit, I was a bit worried when we turned up at the pick up location for the tour to find that there were two big buses full of other travelers destined for the Sami camp. But happily my worries were",
          "it's definitely a must. Being surrounded by this beautiful landscape and reindeers was just amazing. It feels like a dream, like being in a postcard. The sledding tour is also highly recommended. Same people and culture is beautiful. The food was also delicious. Time went so",
          "It was an awesome tour. Kids enjoyed a lot. It was fun to spend time with reindeers. Sledding was also a great experience. Very informative session about Sammi people. Highly recommended with kids.",
          "Recommended when visiting troms\u00f8!!! Everything is so fun! Samisk culture is interesting.. Reindeer are all adorable!",
          "Very welcoming and friendly. We learnt about the Sami culture, the songs and the different dialects. Food good, reindeer great fun. Nothing too much trouble for the team. Best bit for me was the Sami singing as I felt quite emotional. Loved the whole thing. Its expensive but",
          "Reindeers looked scary at first bec. of their antlers but i found out soon enough that they\u2019re gentle animals. I enjoyed my time feeding them & taking photos. To warm up, we got inside the lavvu & took snacks of cookies & hot chocolates by the fire. Reindeer sledding was a nice",
          "This event felt a bit touristy, which it is, but still kept a hospitable vibe by the family hosting. The hosts were especially friendly for working with such a large number of visitors. Loved seeing, petting, and photographing the reindeer. The sleigh ride was underwhelming, but",
          "One of the main reasons my friends and I went up to Tromso was for the reindeer experience with Tromso Arctic Reindeer & to see the northern lights- both which were incredible!! I would 10/10 recommend this tour to anyone! I've never seen reindeer in person and that was truly",
          "Firstly, just want to caveat that the Reindeer sledding is only a small portion of this trip. It is a great experience, but could be somewhat underwhelming (it's not like dog-sledding) and lasts for around 15 minutes. Secondly, despite the above, that's definitely not a",
          "Feeding reindeer in a huge field full of them is certainly new to me. The scenery is beautiful. The sleigh ride wasn\u2019t quite what a expected. Walking pace and just around the edge of a field, albeit a incredibly pretty one, but still enjoyable. The Sami provide a few talks on",
          "We booked for a Reindeer Ride with feeding and Sami Culture experience and it was worth the trip and money. We get to meet the very warm Sami people, feed the very gentle reindeers and rode the sleigh afterwards. This is something you experience probably once in your life if",
          "Loved feeding the reindeer! We didn\u2019t feel rushed and had a ton of time to spend feeding. Lunch was delicious! Everything felt very organized and put together nicely! Would definitely recommend on your visit to Tromso!",
          "It was one of the highlights of our trip to Tromso! Coming so close to reindeer has been a very unique experience! It was also very interesting to learn about the sami culture! The stew was delicious and all together we were taken really good care of! What I liked most about",
          "Everything felt out of this world. There were hundreds of reindeers roaming about that you could feed, and they were definitely ready for their breakfast! Then we went reindeer sledding and thankfully, unlike a lot of touristy places, the reindeers don\u2019t get hit to get them to",
          "We booked this as a last minute trip and it ended up being one of our favourite parts of our time in Tromso. We opted for just the reindeer feed with no sleigh ride which we were pleased with as we got to spend more time feeding the reindeer and appreciating the stunning",
          "I am so glad I booked this tour. Everyone was extremely friendly. I thought I wasn't going to get to experience this trip because I was late for the pickup, but they were able to get a taxi for me to meet them at the camp. Once I got there one of the Sami people were there to",
          "This tour and the husky sledding are really worth it. We have learnt a lot about the Sami and about the reindeers. Dinner was nice and the atmosphere in general was magical!",
          "How wonderful an opportunity to get a glimpse of the Sami people\u2019s history and herding reindeer. Peter was very kind, we learned about the farm, the people and fed the reindeer. The farm is the real treasure. Picture beautiful snow covered mountains at every end, on the deep",
          "A really beautiful and interesting tour! The Sami base camp is really amazing and the reindeer are so cool to see it that close, to feed them and to do some sledging! Furthermore, I really enjoyed the joik exibition. I love that kind of singing and , having the chance to see",
          "My family and I decided to include this activity during our holiday in Tromso and believe me it is a \u201cmust do\u201d. We had our own car and we reached the place by our own but a transfer from Tromso is included in the price. Once you arrive you can feed reindeer: they are adorable.",
          "What a lovely day it was to spend time feeding the delightful reindeer and understand the Sami Culture. It was authentic and you can tell the passion they have for the reindeer with their eyes and also how they have coped with the recent changes of modernisation and yet",
          "I had such a great time visiting this authentic Sami spot, and the beautiful wild reindeer. Aside from the crazy blizzard (it was definitely arctic-authentic!), it was a magical day! The reindeer are amazing to watch and to feed. Learning about the Sami culture was so",
          "I have never experienced such a purely incredible tourist activity as I did here with Tromso Arctic Reindeer. For full disclosure, I did visit Tromso Arctic Reindeer as a blogger\u2019s collaboration but what truly made our time special were the Sami people and the other members of",
          "Was first attracted by the tour name with \u2018Reindeer,\u2019 but turned out what inspired and impressed me the most would be the Sami Culture itself, and the stories told by its people. I felt like being a child again listening to stories by the fire, and was soothed by the calming and",
          "(Espa\u00f1ol m\u00e1s abajo) We took the day(10am) short reindeer tour with Sami culture and it's totally worth it. All the trip was very smooth and the guides very organized and friendly. The Sami people welcomed us profoundly warm and smiling. You start by feeding the reindeer, which",
          "We had a fantastic time here. We did the evening tour and reindeer feeding. We infact came back the next day during the day to experience it in the light. The staff were extremely accomodating and friendly, they called us out to experience the northern lights because they knew",
          "We did this tour and it was magical. The reindeer were amazing, and the reindeer owners were so nice. Our group gathered in the hut, by a blazing fire, and we learned how to feed the reindeer. We were each given a bucket of feed. The reindeer came up and fed from the",
          "Very fun day trip!! The guides are great and the Sami hosts are amazing!! We really enjoyed our time with the reindeer and learning about the Sami culture. I would recommend this trip to anyone.",
          "First of all - great customer service, I prebooked this day out on trip advisor and forgot to add the sledding and they sorted this out for me within 24 hours with helpful communication! The feeding is the best part of the day, you get refillable buckets and there are more than",
          "Learned a lot about the Sami culture. So glad they are able to keep their heritage and livelihood going. Wish others on the tour would have been more considerate about not filming when the guide asked.",
          "Over 250+ deers it was crazy once we were let into the deer field. They are quite shy but they will run over once you get a feeding bucket. The bucket refills are free and you can feed them as long as you like! The sledding was slow but some what enjoyable I was freezing but",
          "We'll begin with the best: the stories about the sami people - very very interesting with lovely humor and charm. The stories teller is very talented and charmful. The second best was the raindeer stew - very rich in taste and the dip was almost soupy and very tasty. Feeding the",
          "Wonderful hosts, Sami culture and history was fascinating. We loved the warm welcome, the weather was terrible and meant sledding could not take place but we loved this tour regardless. The sofa cuddle reindeer feeding was great, food super and gorgeous fire in both huts and",
          "Highly recommended, friendly stuff and cute reindeers. Beautiful landscape and reindeer feeding is very relax.",
          "Great fun! We joined the team there this morning and loved every minute of it. We loved feeding the reindeers and the hopitality and organisation was excellent. We also enjoyed learning about the Sami culture and hearing about where the reindeers spend most of the year, free in",
          "The reindeer feeding was a great experience, there were so many reindeer and you could get away from the other people. Group not too big. Loved learning about the Sami culture and the people were very friendly, encouraging the group to ask questions. I could have done without",
          "Amazing and incredibly beautiful scenery and over 300 reindeer to walk around and feed. A short reindeer sled ride but not to hard on the reindeer. The reindeer are well cared for and visitors make sure they are well fed. Also very fun and educational listening to the Sami",
          "Apart from being surrounded by reindeer which you can feed from provided buckets you are surrounded by natural beauty. A long or short sled ride gives you a unique experience and then find out more about Sami culture and beliefs with Sami guides. So glad I did this tour.",
          "We can't recommend this place enough. From the minute we arrived to the moment we left (reluctantly) we were made to feel very welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for them. All staff were very friendly and knowledgeable .We were met and taken into the Sami tent and welcomed.",
          "We liked the full experience as a whole. The sledging part was not the best, though. Feeding the reindeers, listening to the sami stories, and eating the traditional sami soup was very good. The personnel is very nice and helpful, they are the great bonus of this activity.",
          "I was worried this would be a bit of a tourist trap but it wasn't! First the company kept us up to date over email about the weather conditions and provided different options in case we had to cancel due to be weather. This was really appreciated since we had other cancellations",
          "I absolutely loved our tour with Troms\u00f8 Arctic Reindeers! The tour started on time with our cheerful tour guide. Arriving at the camp after half an hour, we were warmly greeted by the Sami people. The weather was absolutely perfect. We got to feed the reindeers and take a short",
          "We visited the reindeer on a miserable wet day but as soon as we arrived we were made to feel very warm by the welcomes given and the fire !! The group was much bigger than I expected but don\u2019t worry it felt like we were the only ones there when everyone dispersed. We had",
          "I have a 8 year old and a 23 month old and it was perfect for both ages including myself. They feed you a fantastic reindeer soup which is unlimited so you shouldn\u2019t leave hungry. Over all a great family experience.",
          "This was a nice experience. It was a very family friendly tour and we enjoyed meeting and feeding the reindeer. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. It was an amazing sight to see so many reindeer at once. We enjoyed our experience here, food and drinks were nice and",
          "A great morning out we were picked up close to the hotel where we were staying by coach and taken to the village about 20 minutes away.Scenery was sensational and on arrival we received a friendly welcome from the Sami people. The reindeer feeding was great fun and the sleigh",
          "Highly recommended! Feeding the Reindeer was super fun and the stew was yummy. The sled ride was ok, you simply go around the area nothing too far but still a good experience.",
          "It was a nice experience. You have to understand that the reindeer are wild so they will only come to you when you feed them. It felt like we did a lot of just standing around as it was a big group and it took time to take everyone around on the reindeer sleds. The sledding",
          "Highlight of the night was feeding the reindeer dispite the bad weather. Tasty food provided for both me and my vegan son. Would have liked to have spent more time learning about the Sami. Replacement of single use plastic and paper bowls with some thing more authentic would add",
          "This was an amazing experience! We joined the tour in the Tromso City Centre at the Hotel close to where our cruise ship docked. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience of feeding the Reindeer herd and the 35 minute sledding experience. The lunch and drinks provided were",
          "Excelent experience! It is super nice to feed the reindeers, there ale plenty of them! Also 5he stuff is so kind, we met an Argentinian guy in the city center, and he recommend us to came here, where he works. If you go to Tromso, at night try to see the Lights, but during the",
          "Troms\u00f8 Arctic Reindeer's tours are not to be missed! After a short drive from Troms\u00f8, we got to feed reindeers and hang out with them. There were about 300 of them! Aside from reindeer feeding, we also got to try lasso throwing - also a good experience. We got to experience",
          "Great fun! We chose an afternoon trip for this, and were lucky enough to have a sunny day. Feeding the reindeer was an experience: they have distinct personalities and will happily lock horns with any others between them and the feeding bucket. Our trip included the sledding",
          "I booked this activity at the last minute because bad weather cancelled my Aurora Chase. I was happy to find something a few hours in advance that didn\u2019t depend on good weather. Some of this evening was really good. I loved meeting and feeding the reindeer. They are much",
          "I joined on a stormfull day. The wind was blowing in our faces and we was happy that we had chosen to wear warm clothes. We had a three year old boy with us and therefore spent a bit more time getting out of the bus, but even if we was later than the other we was welcomed with",
          "It sounded weird when you told people you did reindeer sledding, then you ate them for lunch as stew, I had the funny looks thrown at me. It was a good experience listening to the Sami guides telling us their ways of life and their cultures.",
          "This is a wonderful experience. To know about reindeers, to know about Sami culture and all. I actually enjoyed the feeding and sledding. Learning about the Sami culture was also very interesting to me. You must dress very, very warmly. There\u2019s plenty of coffee, tea and warm",
          "I had some doubts about going there as I\u2019m not very sociable person and do not like group tours. I like to travel on my own only with my family. However, reindeers are sooooo cute that we couldn\u2019t miss it. And I can say that I have no regrets, on the contrary it was a very nice",
          "Me and my boyfriend went with a hope to learn more about the Sami people of Norway and got so much more than that. The tour included reindeer sledding, info on Sami culture, lunch and reindeer feeding. We would both give this our highest recommendation and considered this the",
          "Had a fantastic day at Tromso Artic Reindeer. Sami were very friendly. Feeding reindeer was a wonderful experience. We had some reindeer stew which was delicious. Reindeer sled was great and learned how to use a lasso. Would recommend to anyone.",
          "Although this wasn't our first choice activity we were so happy we ended up here instead and recommend this as a must do trip for anyone who likes animals or learning about traditional cultures. The pickup and travel was really easy and quick. When we arrived, there was a warm",
          "It was a really great time with Sami people and reindeers !! We are free to go where we want between reindeers, to enjoy beautifull landscape! Sami people are so nice ! Thank you very much !",
          "Although I do recommend this outing, I also have to add that I was a bit disappointed from my expectations. I know it was prime season, and respect they need to earn a living while they can and provide for the reindeer, but there were just more people than I had expected. That",
          "For a few hours away from other activities I\u2019d highly recommend Troms\u00f8 Arctic Reindeer. Located pretty close to Troms\u00f8 it is a great way to find out more about the Sami culture and traditions and to of course see and interact with reindeer up close. The people were so welcoming",
          "Summery of this review: Go for the reindeer/Sami experience whitout the reindeer sledding. Feeding the reindeer\u2019s, the lasso throwing, lunch and the little explanation about Sami was a nice experience and recommendable. The sledding on the other hand felt like a tourist",
          "This trip was better than expected, esp. given I booked last minute. It said it was full online, however I walked into Pukka Travel and was able to book. I only had the one day in Tromso and wanted to do something so said, why not? It says to arrive 10 mins before departure",
          "I loved learning about Sami culture on this tour and their fascinating culture and traditions, as well as their life as reindeer herders. It was a unique experience and it was humbling to be welcomed into a Sami camp to see the reindeer and listen to their stories. There are a",
          "The price of this tour is just riduculus for what you get. You feed the animals, you go in a walk with them, they say \u201ca ride\u201d but I would say a walk, you get a dish o food, and a talk from a sami person. To star, the organisation wasn\u2019t good. The experience it\u2019s self is ok, but",
          "This is a great thing to do. I suspect there are longer tours that go to an actual Sami villiage vs. this outpost at the reindeer farm, but really, it was a perfect amount of time and we got to do reindeer sleighing and it was just right. Very enjoyable and not hours on a bus.",
          "We visited this place at night. It was quite cold and windy out there; however we were well protected in terms of clothes / shoes etc. It was better after we entered the tent since they had kept the fire burning inside and covers also stopped the wind. They explained us the",
          "I booked this trip through chasing lights, but the actually tour was run by Troms\u00f8 artic reindeer experience. I was advised to arrive at least 30 minutes before because a lot of trip leaves from Radisson Blu Hotel, so make sure you check in with the correct person because",
          "It was really good fun being able to feed and interact with the reindeer. You are not constrained as to which to feed, and where to go, just allowed to roam and find the reindeer that are interesting. They are complete domesticated and very friendly.",
          "The Sami guides are great storytellers, we loved the reindeer sleigh ride and getting to feed them and then eat reindeer stew was a really funny contrast to me. I loved how the emphasis was on the environment. The lasso throwing was my favorite part.",
          "This has been a once in a lifetime experience. Being able to see and feed up close a reindeer herd, talk to the herders and learn about Sami culture, traditions, way of life and yoiks ... I will never forget it!! Thanks for a wonderful day \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "My parents and I spent a wonderful day feeding the reindeers, learning about the Sami culture and taking the short scenic sleigh ride (my parents are 70+ so the short one was enjoyable without them getting too cold). Definitely dress up warm though!",
          "Prompted by the TV video 'The Sleigh Ride', our daughter gave us this trip as a Christmas present this year, and it turned out to be one of the best gifts ever. Meeting the Sami family, Johnnie and Lena, with their 9 month and three year old children, was such a pleasure. It was",
          "45 minutes by bus. Given winter shoes and good overalls (good to tell customs that they were left there). Just a lovely experience feeding the reindeer and then sledding and finished off with a reindeer stew and tales of Sami life. 4 hours all up. We were very lucky with the",
          "We greatly enjoyed this trip, the contact with the Sami people and their reindeer was delightful and the lunch was delicious. Like others, we were somewhat concerned about this tour but talking with a couple of the Sami at some length, left me feeling glad to have participated.",
          "I loved this experience! I did the reindeer feeding and Sami culture experience (no sledding) and it was amazing. The reindeer are just too cute and interesting animals to watch. The Sami talk, joik and food was also very enjoyable and educational. The lady who did our talk was",
          "We visited Tromso at the beginning of Dec and booked this trip online, last minute whilst there for the following day. Booking and payment was straight forward. We arrived at the pick up point and everything was well organised, we boarded a nice warm coach and off we went. 25",
          "Feeding the reindeers and learning about the Sami culture was an interesting adventure but I felt it a bit commercial and not necessarily good for the animals who are exposed to the tourist and not properly fed.",
          "This was a really great experience. We suffered a bit during the sledding because it was snowing and very cold, but even so we had lots of fun. It's not an exciting trip like with the huskies, but just to be there on a reindeer sledding was a unique feeling. And afterward we",
          "As a tour leader of a group of 33 tourists, I can say that all was very well planned and organized. Very cosy woden cabins with fire place and hot drinks made all the guests feel comfortable in the cold winter temperatures, feeding the reindeers from hands was a lot of fun and",

          "Even though you're re sharing this adventure with a bus load of other tourists it doesn't loose it's authenticity or feel crowded due to the big open area. You can tell that the hosts are Sami people with a lot of passion and pride for their heritage and lifesyle, which they",
          "The people are really nice and we learned about there culture. We got much time to spent time with the reindeers which was great! We got food and drinks and there was a nice bonfire to warm up.",
          "My partner and I did the afternoon tour on Christmas Day! This tour was a once in a life time experience - meeting and feeding reindeer, reindeer sledding, trying reindeer soup and hearing all about the Sami culture. Would highly recommend!",
          "We chose the half day tour without the sledding and it was still a really fun afternoon. I was extremely excited for this activity but I knew my husband was apprehensive and thought it was a tourist trap. Yes, it is a tourist activity as you can't do something like this",
          "We really enjoyed our time at the reindeercamp. Very friendly people. Feeding the reindeers was great, also taking tour with them was great, even with the snow wind. Would definitly recommend",
          "We had a great day on this half day Reindeer and Sami Culture tour. There was not a lot of snow when we were in Tromso at the end of December 2018. But that did not stop us from having fun petting and feeding all of the reindeer. We did not try the reindeer lunch, so I",
          "Great people, great day and nice food. Started by feeding the reindeer, went on a sleigh ride, ate reindeer stew, sipped hot chocolate by a warm fire and learnt all about their culture. 100% recommend and would absolutely do it all again. Amazing day.",
          "This kind of trip is not really my thing and such excusions can seem a bit pricey but this was a top pick for my partner so off we went. As a \u2018grudging attender\u201d i actually really enjoyed myself. There was lots of time to spend with the reindeer nice wholsome food as well as",
          "This was a lovely start to our holiday. It was great to learn about the Sami culture and feed the reindeer, especially the shy ones. It's actually quite meditative and relaxing watching and feeding the reindeer. The welcome and hospitality is warm and relaxed and the talk from",
          "When visiting the Troms\u00f8 Arctic Reindeer centre, it's important to remember one thing - everything is real. The Sami people working here are genuine - this is an opportunity for insight into their ancient culture. The reindeer are not domesticated, they are not like a herd of",
          "I was at first a little skeptical that this could take more than an hour and keep me entertained especially with drizzling rain in the forecast. Yet, between the short bus ride and roughly three hours we spent there, I don't know where the time all went. We were given a brief",
          "Like everyone else, I was enchanted by the Lapplanders (Sami) and their reindeer. I learned so much, enjoyed feeding the reindeer and enjoyed the sleigh ride. Luna talked to me about their culture - of which I knew very little - and it couldn't have been a better experience. I",
          "So when we visited the weather had been bad so we were unable to do the reindeer sleigh ride and we were given a partial refund for this I\u2019m so glad that we still decided to go The staff were so so so friendly and very accommodating Spikes for shoes were provided and",
          "This was a great experience for us. Rode the reindeer sled, fed the reindeer, and had a traditional Sami dinner and heard about their history. Overall, great experience. We were there during polar nights and northern lights did not make an appearance that particular night.",

          "Awesome experience. Approaching and feeding the reindeers was very cool. The storytelling and the food was good. I recommend to book the short sledge (10 minutes), as it is sufficient and it can get very cold and windy.",
          "We decided to drive here instead of taking the tour bus and they were kind to keep us warm and so attentive while we waited for the others. The best place for a true authentic experience as the reindeers are roaming around freely in very \u2026",
          "Fantastic experience with cute reindeers. You have a possibility to see Sami culture. They are so nice and polite people. 100% recommended.",
          "We spent a very nice time between a large herd of friendly reindeer, by the fire and listening to very interesting stories about the Sami peoples. You must visit this place when you are in the north in winter - you'll be very pleased.",
          "Great place for everyone! It's fun, you get to be really close to the reindeer (literally feeding from your hands), everyone is friendly and really helpful, and the Sami people are so happy to share their culture with you!",
          "Amazing experience. They really careful the dogs. The landscape are awesome."

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Finnish: Tromssa; Kven: Tromssa; Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a city in Troms\u00f8 Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway.  The city is the administrative centre of the municipality as well as the administrative centre of Troms county.  The Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland and its Bishop are based at the Troms\u00f8 Cathedral in the city.  The city is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya which sits in the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait, just off the mainland of Northern Norway.  The mainland suburb of Tromsdalen is connected to the city centre on Troms\u00f8ya by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel.  The suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya is connected to the city centre by the Sandnessund Bridge.\n\nThe 21.25-square-kilometre (5,250-acre) town has a population (2017) of 64,448 which gives the town a population density of 3,033 inhabitants per square kilometre (7,860/sq mi).  The city centre (on Troms\u00f8ya) has a population of 38,980.  The mainland borough of the city, Tromsdalen, has a population of 16,787 and the suburb of Kval\u00f8ysletta on the island of Kval\u00f8ya has a population of 8,681. The most populous town north of Troms\u00f8 in Norway is Alta, with a population of 15,094 (2017), making Troms\u00f8 a very large city for this vast rural northern part of Norway.   It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). \nThe city's largest workplaces are the University of Troms\u00f8 (UiT) and University Hospital of North Norway. The Norwegian Polar Institute also has its headquarters in Troms\u00f8. The Northern Lights Observatory was established in 1928, and two companies affiliated with the Kongsberg Gruppen collect satellite data from space using the observatory. The fishing industry is very important. Norway's Norges R\u00e5fisklag and Norges sj\u00f8matr\u00e5d (seafood council) both have their headquarters in Troms\u00f8. Sparebanken Nord-Norge also has its headquarters in the city. Furthermore, \"Skatt nord\", an agency of the Norwegian Tax Administration is based here too.\nThe city is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from the word for \"island\" (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name.  However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was declared a kj\u00f8pstad and issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as Troms\u00f8 Municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but at that time it was a very small size in area.  Over time the municipality grew much larger in area by merging with neighboring areas (especially during the 1960s).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but the mountains in the north block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Owing to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no real darkness between late April and mid-August.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but owing to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm, and by 1 April it is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). If we include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Tromso only has 14 hours of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of the city of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.\nThe Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and cities in Norway\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Booking a tour to see the Northern Lights is always going to be an uncertain exercise. However many tour reviews you read there is always that thought in the back of your mind that this could be a very expensive way of getting very cold, very slowly. All I can say is that",
          "We went out with Northern Lights Tromso and Magne was our guide. We stopped at a beautiful lake, with no light polluntion and as if he flicked a switch, the lights started, and just got more and more intense. We were snapping away and Magne took our pictures with the lights",
          "Watching the dancing lights under the Arctic skies is one of those ethereal experiences one will remember for a lifetime. Despite frigid conditions on a frozen lake in the middle of nowhere, the experience was surreal with the guide making all possible efforts to find the best",
          "We did the large group tour. It's a bus with about 50 people, so you're obviously not going to get the most personal experience. But we did see an amazing display of the northern lights, so we were very happy. The weather wasn't great when we were there, so the guides took",
          "Awesome tour! Stefan - our guide - is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. You can tell he is very passionate. He drove us to a spot where we could behold the magical, yet mystical, northern lights. He also helped me with my camera settings which resulted in some very nice pictures.",
          "We did a private tour in January 2017 with Stefan Erlingsson. He was a fantastic guide and managed, after a bit of a drive, to spot the lights. We were there during a week of quite bad weather (snow storm most of the week) and were really lucky to have a sighting. Stefan was",

          "Stefan picked us up directly from the Radisson Blu, and took us in the direction of Finland. As it happened, there was a lot of snow, so we changed course and headed back through Troms\u00f8 and went past the town to the west. After a while, we came upon a a clearing where we could",

          "We booked the tour directly from the Hotel concierge. Picket was in mini coach. Stefan came on time to pick us up and started our tour with few more pickups on the way away from city lights. He is an excellent tour guide with fantastic knowledge about the camera settings to",

          "We were afraid not to see anything so we booked twice the tour. Each time it was a great experience : 2 different guides, 2 different places and always beautiful northern lights seen for us ! Very good evenings for sure !!",
          "I have to say the tour is cheaper for a reason. He is the driver, tour guide and drink maker - 3 in 1. Sometime he has to concentrate in the driver and he completely miss the activities in the sky. The coat were unclean and smelly. The whole thing is just no no no! I would",
          "We did 2 tours with Northern Lights Tromso 2 weeks ago, the Fjords tour and a Northern Lights Hunt in a small group. Stefan who did our Fjords tour was great, very informative, friendly and tailored the trip to us ( we were lucky enough to be the only 2 people on the trip ) The",
          "Amazing evening. Edward the guide was kind and reached to everyone in the group. We also got clothing, which was helpful. We were welcomed by Edward's father with campfire and hot drinks, perfect for the cold weather. The Aurora was wonderful, and we didn't drive far from Tromso",
          "Stefan was fantastic and so accommodating on our tour with Norther Lights Troms\u00f8. We eventually had success in seeing the aurora and an excellent (but cold) time whilst on the way. Stefan was knowledgeable and a great guy to have taking us around. Definitely worth the extra $",
          "We were so lucky to have witnessed the lady aurora in person. It's worth going with a tour company as they make great efforts to get you to a spot that would have the best chance of viewing. That one day we were in tromso, the app gave a good chance of light but in tromso",
          "In a nutshell this is a guided trip out to a layby in the hills around Tromso with a chance of seeing the northern lights. It comes with a few tips on camera work and a hot chocolate or 2 to keep the spirits up. We saw the lights and got some great shots so it was worth it, no",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

          "We booked this particularly tour as we had read such positives reviews about the guide. There is no guarantee as to whether you will get to see them but I think Gunnar is one of the more experienced guide\u2019s in Tromso so if anyone will get you to see them he\u2019s probably your best",

          "Gunnar definitely goes the extra mile (pun intended) to make sure you have the best experience! Totally worth it!",
          "Gunnar is THE guide that you need for a Northern Lights experience. We joined a small group that he drove expertly around from his base in Tromso, Norway, looking for the best spots to see the Aurora Borealis. We ended up in Finland for a while! He provides body suits, boots etc",
          "The tour with Gunnar was great! Gunnar makes it possible that we could see the northern lights and therefore we travel far to Finland. There is also very tasty food and drink (soup, bread, dried lamb) around a campfire. :-) At Gunnar you can also get boots and thermo suits.Again",

          "First, after having read some of these reviews, I want to say that it's my understanding that you are never guaranteed a Northern Lights show. It is science and not controllable by Gunnar or any other guide. You have to book your tour understanding that. It's weather. I've also",

          "I decided to book three chases because I thought one was too risky for me. The weather forecast changed every day and I did not know what I can expect. And what I really appreciate is one day when the forecast was totally bad and many agencies canceled the chase but our guide",
          "We spent 2 consecutive nights with Guide Gunnar on his Aurora chase.

Before booking I was concerned that we could end up on \u201cjust another Tuesday trip\u201d,",
          "Gunnar is a great guide, and also a part of an experienced network of guides, who share information. He provides a clothing preparation guide, warm boots and suits, as well as tips about how to stay warm. He seems quite passionate about his work, and it is very important to",
          "I was in Troms\u00f8 with a larger group of friends, so we had to split up and go with several different Northern Lights chase companies.* I went with Guide Gunnar. He gave us warm boots, which were awesome. He showed a good video on the Aurora while on the way. He gave us tips",
          "If you really want to see the Northern lights in Tromso, Guide Gunnar is your man! He\u2019s prepared to drive further and stay out longer than any other tour operator. We spent two nights aurora chasing with Gunnar and one with a big bus company. The small tour option is more",
          "It\u2019s our first time in tromso and we booked Guide Gunnar based on online reviews. It was cloudy on our tour day however Gunnar tried his best shot at it. We did see the Aurora but a single day is usually not enough if you want to view the splendid aurora show. Gunnar thought us",
          "We were staying in Tromso and tried finding the northern lights with no luck on our own. Several people around town said we HAD to call Gunner because he always finds them. Unfortunately (because he books up fast) we were unable to get into one of his chases. But I wanted to",
          "Gunnar is the perfect Aurora guide! We highly recommend him. We had a small group of only three of us, and Tromso was socked in with cloud cover and constant rain. But he took our personal adventure seriously, tracked the changing weather patterns, drove us two hours south and",

          "Had a fantastic night with GuideGunnar. Saw the lights had an amazing dinner over camp fire. Thermal suits boots supplied which I needed as aussies don't normally need cold weather stuff. Helped with cameras and supplied tripods. Local knowledge. Great show. Thanks. Sue",

          "So the sky was apparently covered with clouds so wide that the other agency I had booked & paid months(!) in advance just cancelled on me (turns out Northern Soul Alventure didn't want to drive for just 2-3 clients, shame on them!) So I was quite shocked and desperate, as they",
          "My friend and I did a Northern Lights Chase tour with Guide Gunnar and are SO thankful for our experience! Gunnar has been in the game of chasing the lights for over 20 years and was one of the first six in doing so in Tromso so he KNOWS what he\u2019s doing. Upon arrival we met in",
          "Gunnar is a kinda quirky guy who has been leading chases for the northern lights from Tromso for about 16 years. We did two nights with him chasing the lights and saw them both times. On the first night he told us that we would be crossing the border into Finland and that we",
          "I've just completed three Aurora chases with Guide Gunnar. We got to see them twice. Gunnar was professional, very knowledgable, helped everyone with camera settings and provided hot refreshments & snacks. Even on the one night of no activity, Gunnar was determined to keep",
          "Guide Gunnar was the perfect guide on our Northern Lights chase in early September 2018. He provided us with tripods, helped us set up the cameras and gave us an impromptu lesson in Northern Lights photography. Since I had no experience with night photography, his guidance",
          "On 24 March it was overcast but Guide Gunner took as on a 2.5hour trip to make sure that we experience the aurora properly. He provided the necessary warm clothing and great food. He assisted with camera settings and he himself took great pictures. Clearly a well equipped and",
          "We took the tour on 9th March. A fantastic experience with dancing northern lights, Gunnar seems to know to where the lights will appear. He took us to three locations for diverse backgrounds for northern lights photos. He is a quiet and learned gentleman, so please ask",
          "Having been on other northern lights experiences in Iceland and Sweden I can honestly say Gunnar\u2019s northern light chase is hands down the best! The cloud cover and weather in Tromso had been bad for a couple of days and Gunnar started the tour in the Guides Central office",
          "The best tour and best guide ever! We went to 3 places to trace the Northern Lights We saw the most beautiful dancing one~It's amazing and unforgettable night!",
          "It was most wonderful experience. Guide Gunnar takes extra efforts to make sure we can see the phenomenon of Northern Lights. He drove almost 152 km upto Finland, in search of ckear sky & visible aurora. Plus hot drinks & dinner. Thank u Gunnar. It was a lifetime experience.",
          "5 persons from South of Norway had a nice weekend in Troms\u00f8 where the Northern Light chase trip with Gunnar was the main reason for coming. Gunnar, who is well known from TV in Norway, absolutely lived up to our expectations and we had a very successful trip. As others",
          "We got a last minute booking with Guide Gunnar for the Aurora Chase the day after Christmas, but many of his trips were booked out, so I recommend booking in advance. There were about 10 people on our tour and after an informative and entertaining introduction at Guide Central",
          "I had the northern light tour with Gunnar's new guide. He was a very pleasant and friendly person. He's just still missing some autonomy and training. I was disappointed he had to call Gunnar to know what we should do, where we should go (since the sky was very cloudy). This",
          "When we arrived at Gunnar's office and saw the floor-to-ceiling map on the wall, we knew we were in the right place. Gunnar started by giving us an overview of the area and the weather forecast for the night. Using the huge map that covered one entire wall, he showed us where",
          "We were lucky enough to see the Northern Lights in Kirkenes earlier on our trip to Norway, but decided to try our luck again in Tromso. From the moment we met Gunnar, we knew we were in good hands. He was upfront about the local conditions not being ideal, but assured us he",
          "First of all, Guide Gunnar is a really nice guy - this is important if you're going to spend four hours (or more) hanging around at night when it's -9C! After a briefing, Gunnar fetched his minibus and we were off. The minibus was modern, clean and very well equipped. We watched",
          "Gunnar really knows his stuff and truly wants you to have the best experience on his tours, driving further afield than most to avoid any crowds and finding secluded beaches so you have the lights just to your little group. His knowledge of cameras is so good we found settings",
          "What can I say about Gunnar. He has been in this industry for 20 years now, and was one of the first guides around. This is his last season in Troms\u00f8 and I am so beyond grateful I spent 3 nights chasing the lights with him. Gunnar brings a level of authenticity that a lot of",
          "Gunnar thinks of everything to provide a wonderful Northern Lights viewing experience. It can get cold late at night in Norway, but Gunnar offers snowsuits and insulted boots. He builds a fire. Still cold? He offers blankets. He even serves hot juice and pastries. Gunnar knows",
          "We all met up at Guides Central where Gunnar gave us a briefing, then it was off in his very comfy mini bus. We left a 6pm and by 7 we saw our first aurora. I was not too successful with my camera but Gunnar took some great photos and emails them to each guest. We then went on",
          "Despite the not so good weather conditions, Gunnar did EVERYTHING he could for us to see the Lights and we did! I would certainly join Gunnar on his tour again! He promised to deliver and he did! Thanks Gunnar :-)",
          "We had been on a number of other excursions in the area (all good) though none had a guide as passionate about the region's spectacular natural setting and finding the perfect spot from which to view the Aurora Borealis.",

          "Gunnar was very informative from the beginning, explaining where we were likely to go based on the weather conditions, which at the time, were not good. His enthusiasm was infectious and he drove a long way trying to find the lights for us, which we eventually did, not",
          "Had a great experience from the moment the guide started. We started with an overview of how the evening would go and you could tell he had a great deal of experience. He communicated with other guides and weather people to find the best spot for us to see the northern lights.",
          "Went on a tour on 21 Nov. Before the tour, Gunnar told us our chase route and we were given an informative video about the lights in the bus. It took us about an hour before we reached our first stop, we saw 5 bands of bright green with some very faint reddish purple lights",
          "Booked 2 nights of northern lights chasing with this guide, and he did not disappoint! Very experienced guide with a sense of humor. There's even boots and arctic suits that you can loan from him. Took good care of us from start to finish. Excellent experience!!",
          "The evening didnt bode well and when we met at Guide Gunners office he explained we might need to drive a long distance to find a gap in the very cloudy sky. However within a short while up a snowy road he spotted a gap in the skies and pulled over so we could take some photos,",
          "We joined the tour on Nov 14 and 15. On the first day the weather was so bad with clouds and rain. Gunnar did not give up. He drove us to many different places and turned out we could really see northern lights despite the weather was so tricky. I also missed the pastry and the",
          "17.10.2016 Chasing Aurora @ Laksvatn Full moon , we just got lucky enough to catch some of it..... Thank you Mr Gunnar!",
          "I was curious as to how different these sort of companies are since prices can really differ, so I choose to go on two tours, both with guide Gunnar and Chasinglights, the lattar of which was the most expensive. In all honesty; I thought that the tour with guide Gunnar was much",
          "We were lucky enough to see a breathtaking display of lights but we'll try to review the guide instead of the lights since the latter is never guaranteed! We started our evening in Gunnar's cosy offices at Guides Central. He used a giant wall map to explain the strategy for the",
          "All the day raining and cloudy and then THE NORTHERN LIGHT IN THE SKY!!! MARVELLOUS!! In a 136 km tour, we could see all kind of lights. Gunnar did a fire, gave us hot drinks and snacks and, with a little cold. My wife and me would repeat the experience!!",
          "We went on the tour on 6 october. It had been rainy and cloudy. Gunnar's van was very comfortable. He played very nice videos. On the lights and other areas nearby like Lyngen alps. He tried his best and drove all the way down south to nearly Narvik but the weather defeated us.",
          "We booked a NL tour with Guide Gunna in early September (04/09/2016) with a hope to see the northern light. It was a heavy rain and bad weather in Tromso. He drove us to Finland border and further into Finland. Along the way, he told the story of the place and show us the video",
          "We were off on-time & Gunnar's minibus was warm & comfortable. He took us to a few different spots & I couldn't be happier when we saw the NL at the last stop! My only criticism is that there should be enough tripods provided for the number of people on the tour. This was the",
          "Last week I had the good fortune to go on a tour around the Fjords with Gunnar. What a wonderful experience! He gave us a great day, seeing so many wonderful sights. His knowledge and insight was second to none, and he made us feel very welcome and special. Very comfortable",
          "After having my original planned trip to see the wolves at Polar Park cancelled the day before, I remembered coming across Guide Gunnar when I was doing my research. Luckily he had organised a trip for the same day and I managed to book onto this very last minute.",
          "My bf and I signed up the 5 day soft adventure package and boy was it awesome! In total there was only 4 of us which was nice (it helped that the other two ladies were great too!). We did ice fishing (incl. Snow shoeing), polar park & dog sledding. We didnt do lights chase per",
          "What a great day we had made extra special by Gunnar . Nothing was too much trouble for him . Super friendly guy . He told is lots about the scenery and surrounding areas . Told us what to look for when looking for northern lights which helped us see them later that night after",
          "I was lucky enough to spend the evening with Gunnar as he drove us around trying to find the lights. The weather was really cloudy, but Gunnar was confident and up to date on all the latest information one could possibly get their hands on to find the lights. After driving South",
          "You'll no-doubt see that I've previously been on one of Guide Gunnar's tours in the past (I think TA links to it on this review), and we came back to Troms\u00f8 again this year and immediately booked in. Owing to a situation which I'm not going to publish the details of,",
          "Gunnar lived up to his reputation. He picked us up on time , as we left a cloudy Tromso. Gunaar kept in constant contact with his weather watchers by mobile phone, using this information and his knowledge we drove southwards via Bardufoss and he found a spot where we could",
          "We did 3 chases, with 3 different companies. GuideGunnar was the first. Although he sure knows whats he\u00b4s doing and was committed in finding the northern lights, we weren\u00b4t lucky that night and we could only see the lights using the camera. The tour was nice, but in comparison",
          "We had a fantastic night out chasing the lights with Gunnar. Once we arrived at our destination, he was a gracious host providing warm clothings, tea & sweets (we're hooked on lefse now!). A campfire was setup to keep us warm and made for a fantastic outdoor environment. It",
          "I have booked my trip to visit Tromso area fjords with Gunnar not knowing what to expect. When we met in front of the Emma's Dream kitchen restaurant I felt immediately to be in good hands. Gunnar is a Norwegian, who knows all the area and all the attractions and activities",
          "I had a day tour to the Gorsa Bridge, it was the best and high light of my trip to the Nordic countries. Gunnar is an amazing cook too, we chatted and we talked about our passion for photography, he is a good guide but come in a form of a friend, he is honest, gives good",
          "I really enjoyed my time with Gunnar, he is a unique character full of life and love for the aurora borealis. He was so enthusiastic about getting out there and capturing the moment. He's been chasing them his entire life and yet still has a passion for it. So rare to see a",
          "We saw the lights on a pre-Christmas tour and there were parts of it that were good (hot drinks, snow suits, snacks if you wanted them, a T-shirt advertising his company) but my friend and I found Guide Gunnar himself disagreeable. A girl turned up a few minutes late on the",
          "Easy to book, easy to find his truck, easy to get to see the Northern Lights. This is how Guide Gunnar worked for me and my gal in Oct 2014. He takes great care for everybody in his minivan, and has the knowledge to get one to see his dream come true - observing the northern",
          "My partner Chris and I went out with Guide Gunnar on 10th april during a fantastic trip to Troms\u00f8 and were treated to a magical evening watching the Northern Lights across the border in Finland! We were in Troms\u00f8 fairly late in the season and, as we drove east through a never",

          "On my first day in tromso, I joined guidegunnar aurora tour. His van is big and spacious enough to accommodate about 12 of us. During the journey he will play a few videos for us to watch and learn more about the northern lights. And he also promote us some of the activities he",
          "We went to Tromso with zero expectation to view the northern light, since we went there after Easter, but we booked a trip with GuideGunnar anyway. We are glad we did, we got to experience it. GuideGunnar treated us more than just paying customers, he regarded us as friends to",
          "I have reserved three nights of my tour in Norway hoping to see the northern lights and in all the three nights I saw them. For this success, I am sure, I have to thank Gunnar, a nice and professional guide.",
          "I realised that the chances of seeing the aurora were 50:50, 50% depends on the skill of the guide and 50% depends on the weather! However we were lucky and saw the sky full of lights. We had a fire on the beach, we had only driven for an hour or so, I had a snowsuit and boots",
          "I started looking up tours for my Norway trip way back in October '14, found Gunnar and he's been very helpful and knowledgeable about the Northern Lights. He answers queries in a matter of fact tone. For those who are interested in seeing the NL you have to bare on mind all",
          "Gunnar picked us up from Hav og Fjell and picked others up in Tromso before driving us to a secluded beach about 60km outside of Tromso. On the way he showed us the explanation of what the Northern lights is. On the way we stopped for some photo opportunities and then when we",
          "I started planning for my trip to Norway about a year before I ended up booking it. There was always only one guide that I wanted to go with - Gunnar. And I am so glad that we did. Don't look any further - just book it - you won't regret. The whole process was easy. Simple",
          "We booked a Northern lights trip with Guide Gunnar based on a friend and also trip advisor recommendations. None of us had ever seen the lights and it was a special trip for my Mum's 70th birthday. We also had my 6 year old daughter with us. I have to say that he lived up to",
          "After reading several reviews of where when and who to do a Northern Lights tour with, one place and name came up often....Tromso Norway, Guide Gunnar. Booking with Gunnar was very easy and following his blog I was able to see pictures of current outings.. I booked 3 nights",
          "I had a great night. We travelled quite a distance - approx 130km each way. The transport was comfortable with videos of what to expect. Gunnar was very professional and kept us fully informed as to what was happening. I guess we were lucky and saw a good display. Gunnar even",
          "When you're planning to see the Northern Lights in Tromso, it's difficult to decide which hunting service to choose as there are so many of them. We decided based on the reviews from Trip Advisor and it was an excellent choice. Gunnar is passionate about Aurora, he must have",
          "I will preface this by saying it's pretty clear that any review can't fail to be coloured by whether or not you see the Lights. Where you choose to go depends on so many different variables and can be really confusing. We chose a number of different geographic locations and",
          "We\u2019ve spent 3 full days with Gunnar (from Guide Gummar) mainly for the Aurora chasing. Gunnar is extremely professional providing the service on the level you could expect.

          "On the positive side: nice heated minivan, even with tv screens to see an aurora dvd. On the negative side: everything else. This evening aurora activity was 4/10 (active), cloudy skies in Tromso. So Gunner headed up north to find a clear sky. He stopped on the road and it was",
          "We had booked this tour before leaving England as we had read the excellent reviews. Like many others we experienced the bad storms on Mon 9th Feb which meant that our plane had not been able to land in Tromso and we were therefore a day late arriving. So we were relieved when",
          "Thanks for a wonderful experience. Our son will talk about this for years to come. We learned so much about the area on our drive over. Too bad the weather was so horrible, but here in Norway, you have to learn to just plow through the weather or else you'll be stuck inside",
          "We were trying to book with gunnar for the past one month but they were fully booked on the dates we had planned earlier. We had a bad start to our trip due to the storm Ole, our flights were cancelled and we were wondering if we would ever see the aurora as the entire week's",
          "After a few hours into the evening of Saturday 17th January, Gunnar suggested it was time to chase the lights as clouds were moving in fast. After approx 50 kms we pulled into a layby with a beautiful mountain backdrop and made our way on foot to the frozen lake. Gunnar made a",

          "So well organised and I question the experience of the previous reviewer. They might not have seen any lights but common sense should have kicked in when booking a northern lights tour in advance. I saw lights galore on the night of the 28th. They danced around the night skies",
          "We took the Northern Lights tour on Dec 26 and came back with terrific memories and pictures. We got a first glimpse of the NL as soon as we left the town, and it seemed that we wouldn't get anything better. However, Gunnar drove us further into the hills and kept us",
          "Gunnar was *brilliant* - we were all giving up, ready to bag the night, but Gunnar kept our spirits up - driving from Tromso, through parts of Finland to finally arriving at the Swedish border, and Shazam! there were the lights. Took nearly all of the night, blizzardey and",
          "The weather was perfect, the light activity was high and GuideGunnar was great. He knows his stuff and is able to help you take a great photo. I can imagine that it would be a totally different story if the weather was bad or there were no lights, but Gunnar, nor any guide, can",
          "We booked Guide Gunnar back in March for our trip in December due to his wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor. When we got on the bus Gunnar was confused and had booked us on the wrong date. He told me I was wrong and we had to go through his emails until he agreed he was in the",
          "Gunnar is an incredibly interesting guide! He was responsive and helpful from the moment I contacted him ahead of our trip to Norway. He is also one of a few allowing babies/toddlers on his tour providing a car seat. He answered all questions even before they are asked and is",
          "Only thanks to this man persistence we have finally admired this nature show! The weather was rubbish and we tried to hunt northern lights for hours and everybody in the bus were tired and weary but if it wasn't for Gunnar we probably would have come back that night without",
          "My wife and I enjoyed seeing the northern light guided by Gunnar. After 5 minutes our from the car, my wife intended to skip seeing the light because of the cold and asked by Gunner the reason, she simply said \"cold\". then Gunnar gave her the suit and shoes, she joined back to",
          "From the reviews we had previously read about Guide Gunnar I was expecting great things and let me say we were not disappointed. Guide Gunnar clearly loves his job, and makes sure his customers have the very best experience. We went on both Aurora tours and shore whale watching",
          "Gunnar is a great guide, knows the area well. Had booked with him for 7th dec. However, due to bad weather and him travelling outside the city, the tour had to be \"rearranged\". So went with him on his mini van on the 8th. We started to go out of the city, this particular period",
          "We were in 3 tours the time we stayed in Tromso and Gunnas was, without a doubt, the most experienced of all. The day of our tour he started going to the coast but found out (through checking the skies, other guides and local contacts) that it was getting cloudy from the ocean,",
          "Thanks Gunnar, what a night, the most spectacular show in the night sky we have experienced. A very special night Curtains of colour ,greens,yellow,magenta,pink washing the sky in waves of effervescence. Our group of many nationalities were deeply touched and felt very",

          "Went out 3 adults 17yr old and 9yr old on 8/11/14, pre booked after recommendations on here. Gunnar is knowledgeable, interesting, funny. More importantly, passionate about his country and wants to share. His connections and organisation skills make these trips. Whilst there's",

          "Went on the Northern Lights tour with Gunnar last night (30th October) and didn't have much hope of seeing them. We'd been out the night before into Finland and had no luck. Despite the snow storm in and around Tromso, Gunnar was in contact with other guides around the area",
          "We travelled to Tromso in the middle of September, both to see the city and to experience the Northern Lights. We booked Guide Gunnar Hildonen for three evenings and nights of Aurora chasing. Gunnar's chases start at 6.30 pm, when it was still light. However, he used the time",
          "We had a Northern Lights chase with Gunnar in October 2014. Gunnar is exceptionally well organised all the way from booking to the actual day. He has a very well equipped and luxurious van with tripods, snow suits and the like. On the day itself, there was considerable cloud",
          "My 15 year old son and I booked 2 nights with Gunnar on a recent trip to Tromso and I highly recommend his service. We were fortunate on both nights to see the lights and on 1 of the nights I think this was due to Gunnar's local knowledge as the activity was low but he took us",
          "We had bad weather in our trip in early September and anticipated seeing nothing . Gunnar even let us switch nights as one of the nights weather was so poor . we did and were not disappointed although first two nights were good the third night was spectacular and even he",
          "Hi, my family and I went on two nights Aurora hunting with Guide Gunnar in March 2014. As we wanted to book in advance, we booked two nights in a row. The first night was absolutely clear and still but we saw only a glimpse of the lights. It was still a magical night",
          "We went on Gunnar's tour on 28th Mar. Unfortunately the weather and aurora activity did not cooperate. However, full credit for Gunnar for trying. Of the four tour companies that I tried, Gunnar provided the best overall service. He prepared a nice fire in a forest clearing and",
          "We participated in Guide Gunnar's tour on 18 March 2014. Although the Aurora was not as active as we'd hoped, we were happy with our experience at a couple of different locations over quite a period of time.Like other reviews, Gunnar is professional and does go out of his way to",
          "We were out on a night of heavy snow storm. Gunnar drove us very far towards the Finnish border, but it just kept snowing all the way. After around 3-hour drive, we drove back as Gunnar told us that the weather was so bad that there might be avalanche, plus there was no aurora",
          "Many Thanks Gunnar for a fantastic Northern Lights sight seeing tour. From start to finish you showed professionalism. Tour started off being picked up outside the Tromso Church situated on main high street. Mini bus is very comfortable and spacious. Your running commentary",
          "For the second consecutive year I went with friends to northern Norway for an adventure holiday - part of which was with Guide Gunnar. He is such a funny guy that you are glad you are with him even if you don't see the lights! He is incredibly thoughtful of his guests' needs:",
          "This is stye second year I have taken friends to Tromso and booked Gunnar to help us experience Norway. This year we went snow shoeing and ice fishing which was brilliant fun, well organised and resulted in a delicious lunch on the ice of what we had just caught. We also did a",
          "What a thrill, trucking around the remote Norwegian-Finnish border at all hours in -18 cold! The chase was very exciting and the result was fantastic - surreal even! From the start we didn't know what to expect and what the night would look like but we just went with the flow",
          "We had no idea what to expect but were thrilled with the outcome of our Northern lights trip. We have been on a couple more tours since arriving in Tromso but nothing compares to the competence,determination and enthusiasm of Gunnar to show us the lights. ( wish we 'd booked a",

          "We booked two trips out with Guide Gunnar in March 2013 and were fortunate enough to see the Auroras both nights. The first night there was a lot of cloud and conditions were far from ideal, but we did manage to see Aurora displays throughout the night. Conditions the second",
          "Gunnar drove us out to a beautiful valley next to a frozen lake (that we could walk on) and a beautiful bay. Right from the beginning, we could see hundreds of stars and a thin band of the lights to the north. We were all very impressed, but Gunnar told us that there'd be more",
          "Gunnar picked us up on a cloudy night in Tromso (3rd Feb) and we weren't optimistic about seeing the Aurora. But he kept in contact with other guides and eventually after a few hours of driving and crossing the Finnish border we were rewarded with a wonderful light show. Gunnar",
          "We booked our northern lights hunting with Guide Gunnar due to his many years of experience and it certainly did not disappoint us. On the night of aurora hunting, he went to a few spots and went down to check on the wind and conditions of the area and move on to another spot",
          "We had an Aurora dinner with Gunnar in the first week of January. We really enjoyed the dinner that Gunnar cooked for us. He was a great host. He made a fire for us and somewhere to sit. There was plenty of food and drink. When we arrive at our first location (where we also had",
          "We went with Guide Gunnar on January 12, 2014. It was a snowy, cloudy day in Tromso and much of the surrounding area. We really didn't think we would have any luck at all. Guide Gunnar drove us 200 km/3 hours into Finland before finally finding a small patch of clear sky. We got",

          "Seeing and photographing the Northern Lights was the main reason for visiting Tromso - and they and Gunnar did not let us down. Gunnar picked us up in his minibus and we drove about an hour out of Tromso until we arrived at a snow covered beach. Gunnar set up a camp fire with",
          "I've spent two nights in Tromso hunting the northern lights with Gunnar. The trip was a lot of fun. Gunnar is such a funny and helpful guy. I got the chance to see a few other interesting spots other than the one we stood at waiting for the lights. I could see more of the",
          "We went to see the lights with Gunnar, and we were not disappointed! At first, he didn't think we would be able to find them, as there was a lot of cloud cover, we sat by a lake and made a fire, before a little while later moving on. After driving for a while, Gunnar seemed to",
          "I thought Guide Gunnar and the tour that we booked were excellent. We booked the Aurora dinner and the whole experience was super. We only had to drive for about an hour when Gunnar found a place to pull over and said the lights would start to appear soon, sure enough they did.",
          "We read all the reviews on gunner, but we're really unimpressed. He was not personable to our group, and spent most of the time on his cell phone. I understand it's not a guarantee to see the northern lights, but based on the below we thought it would be an experience, with a",
          "Guide Gunnar is an amazing man.Forget about a needle in Haystack, he can find the Aurora Borealis in a blizzard. We had the most awsome experience,Blizzard on one side, roaring fire with hot soupa and a big hole in the sky with Natures own light show.Gunnar I am going to come",
          "If there's a chance of seeing the lights on the night you go out with Guide Gunnar he will do whatever he can to ensure you find them. Meet in town at a central location and settle back as he drives and drives in search of clear sky and activity. We ended up at the top of a ski",
          "If you have not searched for the lights before it is worth forking out the money for Gunnar. He really does try to provide a good experience and his enthusiasm is genuine and infectious. The dinner option was great and his photographic advice is excellent. Satisfied customers!",
          "Look, you've come all this way to see the lights, and lets face it, it may or may not happen while you're here. However, if you invest some money and go out with Gunnar he will do his UTMOST to defy the weather and take you to wherever you can be to maximise your chances. He's",
          "What a fantastic night! Gunnar is a true professional, and so passionate about Lady Aurora. I was so lucky that there was a wonderful display the night I toured with Gunnar. He is very friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful for those of us with questions regarding our cameras",
          "We went out with Gunnar on 8th October. He picked us up promptly at the Tromso Domkirke at 18.20 and we set off on our journey with 9 other people. The bus was comfortable and Gunnar was clearly very knowledgable. The first stop was at the side of the road about 30mins from",
          "We saw our first display of lights just 30minutes into our tour! We were also the only ones at the site and it was tremendously beautiful with the dusky glow of the sunset just above the horizon. Gunnar knows the best places to see the lights and he is very fast at communicating",
          "I won't repeat what all the other reviews say but they're all spot on, Guide Gunnar is great. We went on a night when there was cloud about and Gunnar did everything he good to make sure we got a clear view (which he did). Unfortunately the Arora activity was low that night so",
          "With Gunnar's guidance,we were happy & lucky to see Aurora light which we ever seen before. His profession and enthusiasm gave us a great impressions and will recommend his service to others people without any hesitation \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Guide Gunnar is 100% committed to providing his guests with a memorable Northern Lights experience! When he picked us up in Tromso and said 'maybe if we can't find them, we will drive to Finland' I knew we were in determined hands! I would not normally take a guided tour when",
          "Having booked a northern lights tour with Guide Gunnar almost a year in advance you can imagine our absolute delight in seeing the most amazing 10/10 aurora display on 20 March. The entire tour experience from booking to pick-up and drop-off was seamless. The bus trip was",
          "We did 2 nights chasing the northern lights in Tromso, one with Gunnar, and one with another guide. Gunnar was excellent and very prompt answering emails and orchestrating the booking (and helpful e.g. sending a text to confirm, as we were already away). On the day, he was",

          "Really couldn't ask for more. Guide Gunnar's enthusiasm is absolutely infectious. Previous reviews have covered everything you need to know about the Arctic Lights tours: easy pick-up, drop-off to your door, smaller group, all cold weather suits and shoes suplied, a few",
          "I went on an aurora tour with Gunnar in late March with my husband. We were picked up on time and in a nice minibus. The minibus was full and had about 12 guests. Gunnar had selected a destination for the evening and it took about an hour to get there. Upon arrival, he offered",
          "Was with Gunnar this April (2013). Was a delight! Tromso if fairly small so pick-up was easy from a central landmark. Drop-off was easier still has Gunnar drops everyone off at their hotels: it is pretty late after all. Gunnar is charming and informative, so what could be a",

          "We booked with Gunnar to see the Northern Lights after reading several TA reviews and were definitely not disappointed. By the time we met at the pick up point, it had been snowing in Tromso for most of the day and we had resigned ourselves to not seeing anything, as the weather",
          "By pure chance we chose the perfect guide for the most perfect night to see the lights. Almost beyond description, the lights were ethereal. Guide Gunnar was excellent, he greeted,, transported and supported us throughout the whole evening/night. He knew the best places to view",
          "So glad we got to see the lights! Guide Gunnar was an excellent guide, and had a passion for the lights! He supplied tripods and warm clothes. Some things to keep in mind to avoid signing up for the wrong excursion: -everyone with us was an avid light chaser. -it's freezing,",
          "Booked Gunnar last October for a 1 day Aurora hunt. Weather in Tromso was blizzard condition but he still tried to find the Lights.Travelled to first in Finland then into Sweden and finally found a brief activity. Although we had seen them the previous two nights Gunnar was very",

          "I can honestly say that Gunnar's enthusiasm, committment to increasing our chances of seeing aurora and his blatant love of his job, made our trip to Tromso the first time we went in 2010, so there was no question we'd try elsewhere when we were lucky enough to return. We had",
          "I highly recommend going on a tour with Guide Gunnar. Gunnar is an excellent guide, whilst the night I was booked on was cloudy, Gunnar went above and beyond to find us some northern lights! We chased the lights all the way near to the Finland border, he set up a fire in a",

          "I stayed in Tromso for only 3 nights (due to costs at the time) and I had only planned one night for the Aura. I felt very much like I had all my eggs in one basket and I had only one evening to see the skies. I had booked in advance after seeing Guide Gunnar on the internet and",
          "I had taken the Aurora comfort and Aurora Sightseeing tour with Guide Gunner two times in October 2012. He knows location of Northern Lights very well and finds the northern lights in bad weather also. Weather was very bad at Tromso. But we saw the northern light in Finland",

          "We went out with Gunnar on 16th Feb 2013. Aurora levels were predicted to be low and not ideal for viewing. We had read Gunnars website carefully and were aware that toilet stops were limited and that he had several tripods he could loan and suits to use if needed, all inclusive",
          "Gunnar is a great guy and he took a party of international travellers on a hunt for the Northern Lights over 6 hours odd. Despite it being cloudy in Tromso itself that night, we managed to get some light action in a few locations and I was happy with what I saw and would go",
          "Wise advice was not to pay much attention to weather or aurora forecasts, but go out with a specialist guide. Gunnar was great fun and really well prepared in his homework and knowledge of options to give you the best chance of seeing the lights. We only went on one hunt, the",
          "We had two nights with Gunnar and he found clear skies on both nights- no mean feat when Tromso was blanketed in cloud. Our friends went with a different guide and paid a bit more for some stew for dinner, and hand warmers and a slightly more comfortable van. But - we both saw",

          "We booked our trip with Guide Gunnar within minutes of booking our flights to Tromso, months before our stay. I'd researched all the chasers and my research, plus the reviews on here, made me confident he was the man for us. Our trip with Gunnar was on 1st January 2013 - our",
          "We booked the one trip with Gunner simply because his 'blurb' said he would drive as far as he needed to, to find the 'Northern Lights'. Well he did exactly what he said he would do. The weather was such that we hadn't seen the sky since we arrived, so we were holding out little",
          "We went on the northern light chase on 25th dec. The activity in the past week was very low. His first stop was at the place called Double Matterhorn. Lovely setting with decent aurora activity. This location is stunning and since it was not windy he helped us set up the camera.",
          "He picked us up very punctually and was very mindful of our comfort level in what was a cold and windy night. Waited for a while before the northern lights started and it was mesmerizing. The little fire helped warmed my toes, and the warm drinks helped! Thanks Guide Gunnar.",

          "He really helped us out when we were chasing the aurora. None of the Northern Lights tour operators in Tromso would take us because we had a 6-month old baby. Gunnar does take babies, but was fully booked. Despite this, he still helped us out. Read about it in our trip report:",

          "We did a trip today with the most fantastic hosts! We got to see hump back whales and orcas, and the team including the captain were very service minded and warm persons. And the polish girl served us an amazing fish soup. Thank you all! We can really recommend this tour!",
          "Philip, Sara and \"el capitan' of the polar queen provided a fun day if cruising the fjord. No sign of whales or orcas, and the eagles flew around us but did not go for the fish we caught minutes earlier. Despite cloud and some drizzle we enjoyed this half day cruise. Catching",
          "We did 2 separate mini bus night tours with PA hoping to catch a glimpse of green light in the sky. But had 2 strikeouts due to relentless cloud cover. I cannot blame PA for the weather, however i feel disappointed at travelling so far, for nothing. After 2:trips out past 2am",
          "Very friendly people working on the boat! We had a lot of fun, there was enough coffee, tea, biscuits and fruits for everyone and for lunch we ate soup (fish soup and vegetarian soup). The cabin is warm and for outside they have polar-suits!! For everyone who gets seasick: They",
          "We had a nice cruise with Capt Jack Sparrow and his lovely crew which was very entertaining and the lady crews were very eager to keep us entertained and comfortable. We even had a go at fishing and it became part of the soup which was delicious. Thank you for the perfect tour!",
          "Fantastic view of the lights inbetween the cloud, long drive but well worth it. Camp fire and hot food at the end topped off a perfect trip. Lucie was a great guide! Would recommend.",
          "Thanks to the whole team, smiling, funny and so kind for this great trip to the sea. We were able to admire orcas and whales, thanks to the \"nose\" of the captain who found the best spots. The great soup, the snacks, the beverages, everything was really perfect, unforgettable",
          "The northern lights small group chase is an absolute ripoff. Not the fact that we didn\u2019t see the lights. The company sells it as a small group with a max of 15 participants. 18 people joined. The chase consisted of sitting in a bus for three and a half hour to go. Stop at ONE",
          "It was one of the worst tour ever, the details they mentioned about mini group, dinner, thermal suit, and chasing northern lights was scan. We only stopped once. The bus was more than 15 people. The bus driver didn\u2019t drive safely, I was scared like hell. It was too expensive for",
          "Went the second time, to see northern lights since I have time and luckily the company had space, we drove a bit longer that night but was worthy, thank you polar adventures and one of the best guides \u201cYago\u201d will recommend to ask the tour agency for the best days to see the",

          "From the welcome on to the ship to the farewell at the end, this was a fabulous day trip. The crew were friendly and knowledgeable and our two teenaged boys both were given a turn at the wheel. We caught cod which became part of the soup for lunch. We\u2019ve never eaten fish that",
          "Though we didn't manage to catch the Lights, the entire experience of the chase including building a campfire was interesting and educational. Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly and offers many insights in Lights chasing. Recommended.",

          "As a visitor to Troms\u00f8, I was made feel very welcome by Edel. Her tours are exciting, informative and she caters to the needs of guests. Thanks to Edel, I will never forget the amazing sights of Troms\u00f8.",

          "We did this husky safari and had so much fun!!! It\u2019s very well organised, the explanation and instructions very clear, great equipment to stay warm (though I advise gloves to wear inside their mittens!) and the dogs are lovely and affectionate. Would do this again!",
          "Our plane couldn't land in Tromso due to snowstorm, yet this is not a legitimate reason for that company to agree to a refund. Be cautious when booking with these people, as they are not customer oriented at all. It's your money that counts.",

          "A very well organized and professional tour. Just 15 people in the bus and a funny, talkative and expert guide (Alexia) with us. She helped us taking nice pictures and brought us in the perfect spots to chase the Aurora. I really recommend it.",
          "My husband and I did the Aurora Safari Minibus in September and highly recommend this tour! Even though the weather wasn\u2019t great, we had a wonderful experience. We left from the Radisson Blu and drove about an hour and a half to our first stop. William was an excellent guide",

          "We booked 2 tours with Tromso safari, the first one was dog sledging and it was amazing and really worth (I wrote a positive review for that one) but our excursion for northern lights was just a disaster. First, we checked the weather and we knew it was going to be bad to see",
          "It was a very nice RIB boat tour, with a interesting guide and we were lucky enough to see the midnght sun. It was supposed to last three hours but we spent 30 minutes to dress and only 1 hour and half on the sea, before going back. For this price, I would have expected a longer",
          "Our experience chasing the Northern Lights with Tromso Safari was simply UNREAL!!! It is not lost on my wife and me that we were EXTREMELY lucky to have witnessed the lights and within a half hour outside of town while others can drive for hours and not see it! Luck or not",
          "A dog sled, fresh powder snow dropping from above and an untouched serene landscape; words cannot describe this experience. It was truly magical. DO NOT miss this while you are here. Its not just the lights which will bring me back to Tromso",

          "Everything was exactly as promised. No complains at all about this company and their service. I am not giving Excellent because it is a tough evening. To stay outside for ours, with no restrooms or a cabin to recover from the cold can be very difficult. We tried the next day",
          "We stayed at the Radison where the group works out if so didn\u2019t have far to travel. There were a few different trips going on, so make sure to go to the counter and get the correct wrist band and book in. It wasn\u2019t clear this was what we needed to do. Other than that everything",
          "we went on the mini bus northern lights tour on April 2nd and it was perfect. we would have done the base camp tour that they do (witch is cheaper) but it stopped running at the end of March. I am glad of this tho as on this tour we got to go to lots of different stunning",

          "I chose the catamaran was because I was travelling with children ages 5 &10. The cabin would have been the ideal place for warmth and if they needed to sleep the large sitting area would be ideal. I dont think it was bad choice especially when we had Robert giving us detailed",

          "We would like to especially thank you Martha and Tor who guided us on the 30th of December during a northern light safari! This night was not predicted to be successful (all indicators and weather were not supposed to be part of the trip), but as Martha well explained to us,",
          "We, two friends from Switzerland, had booked the Husky safari and it was great fun! It was a cold day at the end of December 2017 (around -20 degrees) and it had just snowed the days before. The guides were very helpful and provided helpful information and some snow gear",

          "RIB boat whale safari was great fun - not for the faint hearted! Most of the journey is by a large catamaran where there are multiple safaris on tge same boat. The highlight is the actual fast driving ok RIB boat in search of whales - we were lucky to sea humpback whales three",

          "We did the cruise to see the whales, which was a wonderful experience. The boat is run down and could do with a little refurbishment but it was worth it. The fjords were amazing and we got to see the killer whales. At night we did the northern lights minibus tour with William",
          "We were fortunate enough to see the Northern lights on an evening when they were absolutely spectacular and thanks to William (our tour guide for the evening) and his experience and intuition we saw the lights in their full glory. This really was a night (and a Christmas) to",

          "I did this trip on 12/18/17 and had the best time ever! I really couldnt recommend this enough. I look forward to my next trip to Tromso so that I can do it again. The guides were great and the dogs were amazing. The landscape and the trail that you take is simply beautiful.",

          "We took a few tours with Troms\u00f8 Safari and we were pleased with them. We were met on time at the Radisson Blu and picked up in suitable vehicles. The trips were not over crowded, in fact the groups we were in were small but this is not a bad thing as it meant we had more time",
          "I booked three tours with Tromso Safari on consecutive nights, Aurora Basecamp, Aurora Safari Minibus and \"Best Kept Secret\". Both the Basecamp and Minibus tours were well organised with knowledgable guides. Despite the blizzards we saw the aurora on both nights. A big shout",

          "This is a tour I most certainly recommend. The staff is very professional, kind and easy to understand. The quality of the equipment is perfect. Being able to ride the sled yourself was so much fun, they almost had to pull me off when the trip was over. Thanks Tromso Safari!",
          "Overall, very pleasant and informative staff who were always very smiley and happy to help. Despite this, not only was the trip 3 1/2 hours travelling to the whales feeding ground through sometimes choppy waters, we also were unfortunate enough not to see any whales.",

          "I'm going to be honest, on our 4 day trip in Tromso we didn't get to see the northern lights.... the first night we were booked with another tour, the second our trip with another company got cancelled due to advers weather conditions, and the last we booked with Tromso Safari",
          "Although this trip was quite expensive it was worth every penny. We went on the catamaran Aurora explorer. The journey to reach the whales was almost 3 and a half hours due to the location of the whales. The arctic wilderness was a sight to see and the polar sky was amazing.",

          "Northern lights trip on minibus was compared to other companies in tromso really bad. Guide talks the first 10 mins the rest of the tour is silence. Guide doesn't seem to like its job neither is fascinated by what it wants to show us. Doesn't react when you talk the guides",

          "We joined the tour on 8th March 2016 and had a private taxi to fetch us to the base camp as the tour bus was full. Denis was the guide and she was very patient in explaining to us the culture of the Sami tribe as well as things that we can do in Tromso. As we reached the base",
          "Wonderful trip to see the northern lights. Well organised and taken to just the rout place as we would not have thought seeing the lights was possible with the weather in Tromso. Warm space to retreat to and great help with camera set up for first time visitor",

          "We are from tropical countries who have never experienced snow showers throughout the day. A trip to the Arctic circle to Troms\u00f8 is a new experience and my desire to see the northern light had been there several years ago. We follow the tour organized by Troms\u00f8 Safari base",
          "What a night. I realise luck is involved but the team got us to the right place at the right time due to their expertise and we saw the best 90 minute show on earth. The area of cleared snow was as big as a football pich giving everybody room to spread out and enjoy the",
          "The first thing I noticed after being picked up directly from the hotel was how friendly our guide was, Truls was very informative and so helpful. I was secretly dreading this excursion as when I did the one in Iceland, that wasn't very well organised at all, we were just left",

          "What a wonderful experience to be able to catch the full specter of the Northern Lights at the various stops. But the best was kept to the last, Truls favorite location where we spent most 30minutes watching the dancing lights all above us. Our son just arrived just in time in",
          "Despite the weather of overcast and some rain, rather than beginning the evening going to where the lights might be we headed to the \"base station\". It was a wonderful opportunity to visit with a Sami reindeer herder as we waited to decide where to go. Fortunately we did not",

          "If you\u2019ve never seen Northern lights before you definitely need a guided tour like Tromso Safari. The tour is very well organized, they take you away from the city lights, with the option to move between camps to provide you with best viewing opportunity. The service includes",

          "They have 4 base stations they can take you to & they check to see which one offers the best chance. We went to one & although it was cloudy when we got there they did say it would clear later. It did & we saw an amazing light show. They have an open fire there & a hut where you",
          "Not only did we see the lights on this tour, we decided to come back directly to Tromso and book another trip or two with Tromso Safari. The whole experience from preparing us for the trip, to the ride there and videos on board, to the sincerity, patience, and genuine care of",

          "This was an excellent trip. Leander and Denise were very helpful, particularly with camera tips! It is great to have the base station because you are outside for some hours, so its great to have somewhere to go where you can warm up by the fire and have a hot drink.",
          "Comparing with Northern Lights hunting in Ivalo, Finland, I find that our trip in Tromso, Norway is more enjoyable. One reason is that we were lucky to watch the Northern Lights in Tromso. Another reason is that the base station offers hot drink, shelter, washroom and even",
          "The guide Leander was informative and the coach travel,was punctual and the base was great as we had option of fire, hot chocolate and warm suits, which I recommend. It was an incredible experience, I had not been prepaired for two bus loads of people ooing and ahhing at the",

          "After a day out dog sledding in a virtual blizzard we were recommended by the young lady at the tour desk in the Radisson Blu that it was a good night to go on the tour - we were sceptical but she was absolutely spot on - we travelled by coach and arrived at the nearest base",
          "We had a great night with Alessandros photography tour. Tripods were available and advice on how to take the pictures was invaluable for us as novice photographers. Alessandro had an excellent strategy and we got lots of amazing pictures. Bjorn our driver was really good and",
          "So we took a tour with student discount. The bus leaves from the city centre ( Radisson blu). The guide in our bus was a lady (forgot the name). She was really interactive and explained all the camera settings as well. At the base camp, it is very cold ( around -12 degrees).",
          "First impressions weren't good with a delayed departure and some jostling to get onto the bus and then another delay at the next pick up point. However, once underway the rest of the night was great. It was an hour and a half drive south to the base station where hot chocolate",
          "We went to Iceland last year and were bitterly disappointed not to have seen the Northern lights. However, we were more hopeful in Tromso and our waiting paid off. We were collected from our hotel the Radisson Blu and driven about 2 hours to a place where we were expected to",
          "We spent an evening chasing the northern lights with the great guide/ photographer Alessandro. We were very lucky as we had an amazing night where Mother Nature threw us one amazing light after another. We only needed 3 stops for the evening as it just couldn't get any better",
          "The tourguides Susanne an Denise were excellent hosts during the tour. They are knowledgeable and very helpful. At the base camp the Northern Lights came out and there you also had the opportunity to get a picture taken which was very nice. Would definitely recommend their tour.",

          "We got great pictures of the northern lights. The Sami basecamp was a good place to be with a fire 2 tents and a cabin.",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university. As of the spring in 2010, the city's first ice rink has been open and is home to Troms\u00f8 Hockey, which plays in the Swedish Ice Hockey Association's League 3.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway (in Norwegian) Troms\u00f8 travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTroms\u00f8 Municipal Council",

          "Oldest pub in town and a pleasant character to it.  Tourist drinking hole rather than a local hang out.  Opted for the mack wheat beer which was very nice. Brits be prepared to gasp as the barman asks you for \u00a315 a pint though...",
          "As soon as you walk in, you feel as though you've been transported to the early 1900s when locals would gather around and boast of their achievements over barrels of beer! They only have beer options. Also, so you are aware, they close \u2026",
          "Great place in Troms\u00f8 to grab local beer, alcohol is expensive in Norway, though. 25eu for beer sampling",

          "The beer has lots of flavor, I got number 39!",
          "They say it is the northernmost brewery in the world. We have to trust them. But what is certain is that they have a large variety of beer that tastes very good. The pub itself has an interior design that is very fitting for a brewery. All in one, if you find yourself in Troms\u00f8, you should surely try at least one of their beers.",
          "Lovely beer, great atmosphere, and friendly staff...and the dried cod was an experience!",
          "Worth visiting for beer aficionados but no sample tastes (even limited like 1 or 2) to see What you\u2019d like is a letdown hence a 4 vs 5",
          "Good selection, but quite steep prices. Old and typical pub interior.",
          "Cracking place for a drink! They serve a huge choice of the beers made by the Mac brewery which is part of the same building. They have the obligatory dead polar bear in the bar. Locals were drinking here when we visited the pub. The bar had a traditional pub feel to it. They appeared to only serve snacks (the pub not the locals).",
          "Good choice of beers from the micro breweries, the bartender can advice you very well. I recommend taking 5 0.2l glasses. There is no food, only some very small snacks. My favourite beer from here is called \"guilty pleasure\", some nice smoked beers are also available",
          "Great atmosphere. A lot of Norwegian beers on tap. Some really special tastes.\nFor European high priced beer. But it was worth it.",
          "Amazing beer selection! Note, you can create your own flight. Premade flights don't cost less than getting those tasters individually.",
          "Loved the music and overall atmosphere and they have a large variety of beers to choose from. I went with Red Sn\u00f8 and it was like nothing I've tasted before. Definitely going back there tonight.",

          "Great pub a must visit",
          "Cool bar for tourists. Really nice interior. But don\u2019t expect to rub into many locals. But you can chat with people from all over the world who drop by while their cruise ship is in town.",
          "Fantastic selection of beers and nice service",
          "50 beers for choosing but the  taste before buy so that's why 4 stars not 5.  The place is quite worm and beautiful.",

          "Great pub great beer well worth the visit amazing staff",
          "I had bigger expectations here. I ordered a beer and foud it not very good. It was clearly Dms in it. When I ordered another, I told the guy in the bar. He answered that he had heard before that something was wrong with this. How can you sell beer you know is bad?",

          "67 taps of beer, great place for meeting with friends",
          "Extremely expensive compared to other pubs in Tromso but worth a visit for one drink. They have a brewery tour but can't comment on this as we didnt do this.",
          "A traditional beer house with the atmosphere that fits the tradition. Friendly bartender. Food offerings are minimal, beer offering wide and good.",

          "Nice place and really a lot of different beers but nothing to eat...",
          "A must if you love beer and what we in Norway call a \"brown bar\". Try the taste-menu, where they pick a few different beer's for you to taste. Not loud music, so you can actually sit there and talk to your friends or a local beer loving person. Smell like an old bar, but hello, that's the way it's supposed to be.",
          "Nice local beers on tap, the staff can advise you well based on your preferences. They don't have much choice for snacks, so don't come here on an empty stomach.",
          "Incredible beer selection, place with historical value, a good place to taste different good beers while having a good chat with friends. When I visited, there were plenty of tables available. It was around 9 pm, so I guess early, so not sure if later it's crowded.",

          "Good to see old pics of Troms\u00f8 in the pub. Good collection of local and international beers. Microbrewery tours also offered nextdoor but we couldn't do it.",
          "Best place",
          "Incredible list of beers, lots of seating, friendly staff. Usually I would mark down a star for value but having spent more time in Norway, their prices are comparable to the rest of Troms\u00f8. A must see during your stay if you\u2019re visiting.",
          "Great beer selection, many of which come from the microbrewery above the bar. Place gets busy but the bartender was very helpful and nice",
          "nice pub in tromso city center, directly connected with the brewery above. Over 70 draft avaiable, all at norvegian prices.  \nThe bad part is that since i can pay up to 20 euro for half liter, i would have expected to be able to have a \u2026",

          "This is a fantastic bar with a massive array of beers from all over Norway. They also offer tryouts which is such a great way to taste a variety. I would have given it 5 stars but the eye watering bill dropped a star. Norway is not a great place for heavy drinking but that's not why you would come here.",

          "Pro - good experience and nice view during snow fall\nCon - the water heater was not functioning all the time. ",
          "It took me a look time to find the reception after they closed and found the key. The view is amazing, unfortunately the night we stayed was heavy snow so no Aurora can be seen, however the view outside was gorgeous. The room is big but the bed is too soft, the towel seems be using too many times, breakfast just not so good",
          "Very good! Great view to mountain. Very good and friendly service. Cabins are great. Specially Superior and De Luxe!. Better accommodation than in a hotel. Really! I REALLY can recommend. Also the breakfast included was very good. The cabins are fully equipped, new and clean!",
          "Needs a car to reach as its a long way from anywhere. In the depths if winter, its a must. Place is basic and fine. Dont expect anything fancy as its a camping site and caravan parking location and not a regular hotel. Good for overnight family stay.",
          "Great location, walking distance to Troms\u00f8 centrum.\n\nGood shared spaces, new and very clean.\n\nGood service",
          "Good location close to Troms\u00f8 center. Location is the best quality for this camp site.\n\nWhen entering the camping site, it looks like a big parking lot. For Caravan travellers, it is not the most cozy/beautiful place. However, there is a \u2026",

Kitchen have all essentials for quick breakfast and pack lunches. The location is great as well, not too far from town but close enough and far away from th crowd.",

          "The place is good - a river nearby, close to the city center, a nice house. But the cost is overpriced and linen is included in the price, although we did not need it. The internet is very bad. Camping itself is a large, densely populated one. If you like privacy, look for another option.",

          "Yes, this one is expensive, in fact TOO expensive \u2014 325 NOK in low season (sept) for camper incl electr REALLY is too much. However, the pitches aren\u2019t as cramped as they appear from the entrance and the artificial grass works out \u2026",

          "Such a lovely cozy place to stay. I enjoyed every moment of it.",
          "A great place for aurora viewing. A little outskirts of the city makes this place better. There are frequent buses available to reach this place. There is a cemetery nearby, where lights are switched off after 8pm. Things become more fascinating.",

          "This camping is amazing ! Nice cabin , with a full equipment, the decoration is very sweet inside and you feel like at home ! The staff at the reception desk are very welcoming and they always respond to every inquirie that you can made. \u2026",

          "I give the toilets and showers the best result in Norway so far 9/10. There is a 24/7 free freaking SAUNA!!! Went back to the camping just for that. Kitchen is small as usual, but much better than most of them in Norway. Friendly staff. Clean, tidy, modern and cheap.",
          "Super friendly and knowledgeable staff and warm, cosy accommodation with incredible surrounding scenery.",
          "Really friendly and welcoming staff. We stayed there for one night which is perfect if you want to visit the city. The wcs and showers are very clean, new and for free. Only bad thing is that the campsite is pretty crowded and impersonal. We payed 235NOK for a bus without electricity in September.",
          "Small bungalows are a good option but if you book in advance I recommend superior class ones.\nYou can park beside the bungalow. \nThere are also a nice small river behind the bungalows making you feel inside the nature.\nThe access by car to the camping use to be somewhat difficult if there is too much snow in winter.",

And that\u2019s exactly what the smell was like. The interior was old and partially broken. The WiFi didn\u2019t reach to our cabin.",

          "Stayed in a deluxe chalet down near the small stream on this camp site. I would call this glamping, posh camping. Chalets was a great size and super location. Staff were all friendly and as helpful as they could be. Heating worked very well \u2026",
          "It is a very clean and big City camping. The new sanitary building has alot of space.\nIt is one of the worst campsites for a tent. The tent place is between trees and bushes. it si like camping in the wilderness. But you have to pay for it. The price for the night was ok. Shower and everything is included in the price.",
          "Nice and clean but the key card system works very poorly",

          "Good price, decent tenting spots, good and clean general facilities + a sauna!",

          "Very dissatisfied with this camping. Were ignored at reception at first just to be barked at when trying to book a place for the camper. The place seems nice and tidy but the price 360 nok in late august is not appropriate to be shouted at. Unique No-go experience for us, we've been travelling scandinavia for 5 weeks now...",
          "Totally worth the experience of staying at the mountains in a hut/camp. Ensure you book this when the prices are low.",
          "Insolence! The owner tries to increase the prices, despite firm booking. For this he invents an excuse, to change the booked accommodation, into a more expensive one.\nOtherwise the campsite is very nice!",

        "wiki": "Troms\u00f8 (, also UK: ; Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8tr\u028a\u0302ms\u0153] (listen); Northern Sami: Romsa; Kven: Tromssa, Swedish: Troms\u00f6) is a municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Troms\u00f8.\nTroms\u00f8 lies in Northern Norway. The 2,521-square-kilometre (973 sq mi) municipality is the 21st largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Troms\u00f8 is the 12th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 76,974. The municipality's population density is 31.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (81/sq mi) and its population has increased by 14.4% over the previous 10-year period. It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway and the third largest north of the Arctic Circle anywhere in the world (following Murmansk and Norilsk). Most of Troms\u00f8, including the city centre, is located on the island of Troms\u00f8ya, 350 kilometres (217 mi) north of the Arctic Circle. In 2017, the city of Troms\u00f8 had a population of about 65,000 people spread out over Troms\u00f8ya and parts of Kval\u00f8ya and the mainland.  Troms\u00f8ya is connected to the mainland by the Troms\u00f8 Bridge and the Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel, and to the island of Kval\u00f8ya by the Sandnessund Bridge.\nThe municipality is warmer than most other places located on the same latitude, due to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Troms\u00f8 is even milder than places much farther south of it elsewhere in the world, such as on the Hudson Bay and in Far East Russia, with the warm-water current allowing for both relatively mild winters and tree growth in spite of its very high latitude.\nThe city centre of Troms\u00f8 contains the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, the oldest house dating from 1789. The city is a cultural centre for its region, with several festivals taking place in the summer. Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland and Svein Berge of the electronica duo R\u00f6yksopp and Lene Marlin grew up and started their careers in Troms\u00f8. Noted electronic musician Geir Jenssen also hails from Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 is named after the island of Troms\u00f8ya, on which it stands. The last element of the city's name comes from  'island' (Norwegian: \u00f8y, Danish: \u00f8), but the etymology of the first element is uncertain. Several theories exist. One theory holds \"Troms-\" to derive from the old (uncompounded) name of the island (Old Norse: Trums). Several islands and rivers in Norway have the name Tromsa, and the names of these are probably derived from the word straumr which means \"(strong) current\". (The original form must then have been Strums, for the missing s see Indo-European s-mobile.) Another theory holds that Troms\u00f8ya was originally called Lille Troms\u00f8ya (Little Troms\u00f8ya), because of its proximity to the much bigger island today called Kval\u00f8ya, that according to this theory was earlier called \"Store Troms\u00f8ya\" due to a characteristic mountain known as Tromma (the Drum). The mountain's name in S\u00e1mi, Rumbbu\u010dohkka, is identical in meaning, and it is said to have been a sacred mountain for the S\u00e1mi in pre-Christian times.\nThe S\u00e1mi name of the island, Romsa, is assumed to be a loan from Norse - but according to the phonetical rules of the Sami language the frontal t has disappeared from the name. However, an alternative form - Tromsa - is in informal use. There is a theory that holds the Norwegian name of Troms\u00f8 derives from the S\u00e1mi name, though this theory lacks an explanation for the meaning of Romsa. A common misunderstanding is that Troms\u00f8's S\u00e1mi name is Romssa with a double \"s\". This, however, is the accusative and genitive form of the noun used when, for example, writing \"Troms\u00f8 Municipality\" (Romssa Suohkan). In Finnish, however, the word is written with a double \"s\": Tromssa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area has been inhabited since the end of the ice age. Archeological excavations in T\u00f8nsvika, just outside the city limits, have turned up artifacts and remains of buildings estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages: a fortress on the frontier ===\n\nThe area's rich Norse and S\u00e1mi heritage is well documented. The Norse chieftain Ohthere, who lived during the 890s, is assumed to have inhabited the southernmost reaches of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality. He described himself as living \"furthest to the North of all Norwegians\" with areas north of this being populated by S\u00e1mi. An Icelandic source (Rimbegla) from the 12th century also describes the fjord Malangen in the south of today's Troms\u00f8 municipality as a border between Norse and S\u00e1mi coastal settlements during that part of the Middle Ages. There has also been extensive S\u00e1mi settlement on the coast south of this 'border' as well as scattered Norse settlements north of Malangen\u2014for example, both S\u00e1mi and Norse Iron Age (0\u20131050 AD) remains have been found on southern Kval\u00f8ya.The first church on the island of Troms\u00f8ya was erected in 1252. Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"\u2014the nominal \"heathens\" being the S\u00e1mi), was built during the reign of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson. At the time, it was the northernmost church in the world. Around the same time a turf rampart was built to protect the area against raids from Karelia and Russia.\nTroms\u00f8 was not just a Norwegian outpost in an area mainly populated by the S\u00e1mi, but also a frontier city towards Russia; the Novgorod state had the right to tax the S\u00e1mi along the coast to Lyngstuva and inland to the Skibotn River or possibly the M\u00e5lselv River, whereas Norway was allowed to tax areas east to - and including - the Kola Peninsula. During the next five hundred years Norway's border with Russia and the limits of Norwegian settlement would be pushed eastwards to S\u00f8r-Varanger, making Troms\u00f8 lose its character as a \"frontier town\".\n\n\n=== 1700s and 1800s: the \"Paris of the north\" ===\n\nDuring the 17th century, while Denmark\u2013Norway was solidifying its claim to the northern coast of Scandinavia and during this period a redoubt, Skansen, was built. Despite only being home to around 80 people, Troms\u00f8 was issued its city charter in 1794 by King Christian VII. This coincided with, and was a direct consequence of, the abolition of the city of Bergen's centuries-old monopoly on the trade in cod. Troms\u00f8 quickly rose in importance. The Diocese of H\u00e5logaland was created in 1804, with the first bishop being Mathias Bonsak Krogh. The city was established as a municipality 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).\nArctic hunting, from Novaya Zemlya to Canada, started up around 1820. By 1850, Troms\u00f8 was the major centre of Arctic hunting, overtaking the former centre of Hammerfest, and the city was trading from Arkhangelsk to Bordeaux.In 1848, the teacher training college was also moved from Trondenes (near current-day Harstad) to Troms\u00f8, with part of its mission being to educate S\u00e1mi scholars - there was a quota ensuring that S\u00e1mi gained access. The teacher college was followed by the Troms\u00f8 Museum in 1872, and the Mack Brewery in 1877.During the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 became known as the \"Paris of the North\". How this nickname came into being is uncertain, but the reason is generally assumed to be that people in Troms\u00f8 appeared far more sophisticated than visitors from the south typically expected.\n\n\n=== Early 1900s: exploration and war ===\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Troms\u00f8 had become a major Arctic trade centre from which many Arctic expeditions originated. Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Umberto Nobile and Fridtjof Nansen made use of the know-how in Troms\u00f8 on the conditions in the Arctic, and often recruited their crews in the city. The Northern lights observatory was founded in 1927.\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Troms\u00f8 served briefly as the seat of the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in Troms\u00f8 on 10 April 1940 after flying in terrible conditions. From Troms\u00f8 he issued orders for total civilian and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from Tr\u00f8ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. Troms\u00f8 escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by RAF Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism off the Troms\u00f8y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.\n\nAt the end of the war, the city received thousands of refugees from Finnmark county and the North Troms area - which had been devastated by German forces using scorched earth tactics in expectation of the Red Army offensive.\n\n\n=== Late 1900s \u2013 today: rapid expansion ===\nExpansion after World War II has been rapid. The rural municipalities of Troms\u00f8ysund and Ullsfjord, and most of Hilles\u00f8y, were merged with Troms\u00f8 on 1 January 1964, creating today's Troms\u00f8 municipality and almost tripling Troms\u00f8's population - from 12,430 to 32,664. In addition, the population growth has been strong, with at times more than 1,000 new Troms\u00f8v\u00e6ringer (residents of Troms\u00f8) annually. The population of Troms\u00f8 municipality today is 68,239, and the urban area, Norway's ninth most populous, is home to 58,486 people. This excludes most of the city's students, however, who often do not change their address when moving to Troms\u00f8.\nA major development was the opening of Troms\u00f8 Airport in 1964, situated on the main island, and in 1972 the University of Troms\u00f8 was opened, at the time one of four universities in Norway and the only one serving the northern half of the country. A local teacher's college and museum were eventually incorporated into the university. The Norwegian Polar Institute was moved to Troms\u00f8 from Oslo in 1998. More recently, the university has expanded further through two mergers, first with University College Troms\u00f8 in 2009 and then with University College Finnmark in 2013.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Troms\u00f8 was established as an independent municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city was completely surrounded by the Troms\u00f8e landdistrikt (the rural municipality of Troms\u00f8 / later renamed Troms\u00f8ysund), but they were governed separately. As the city grew in size, areas were added to the city from the rural district.On 1 January 1861, an area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 110) was transferred to the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1873, an unpopulated area of Troms\u00f8ysund was transferred to the city. On 1 July 1915, another area of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 512) was merged into the city of Troms\u00f8. On 1 January 1955, the Bjerkaker area on Troms\u00f8ya (population: 1,583) was transferred from Troms\u00f8ysund to the city of Troms\u00f8.During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the city of Troms\u00f8 (population: 12,602), the municipality of Troms\u00f8ysund (population: 16,727), most of the municipality of Ullsfjord except for the Svendsby area (population: 2,019), and most of the municipality of Hilles\u00f8y except for the parts on the island of Senja (population: 1,316) were all merged to form a new, larger Troms\u00f8 Municipality.On 1 January 2020, the municipality became a part of the newly created Troms og Finnmark county, which replaced the old Troms county.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nThe coat of arms of Troms\u00f8 was devised in 1870 and is blazoned \"Azure, a reindeer trippant Argent.\" It is often surmounted by a mural crown with five or four turrets. The municipal authority currently uses a stylised rendering drawn by Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg (1898\u20131987) and adopted by royal resolution on 24 September 1941.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the eighth-largest municipality in Norway with a population of 71,590, and the centre of the ninth-largest urban area, with a population of about 65,000. The city is home to the world's northernmost university and also houses the northernmost botanical garden and planetarium.The city centre is located on the east side of the Troms\u00f8ya island \u2014 over 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the Arctic Circle at 69\u00b040\u203233\u2033N 18\u00b055\u203210\u2033E. Suburban areas include Kroken, Tromsdalen (on the mainland, east of Troms\u00f8ya), the rest of the Troms\u00f8ya island, and the eastern part of the large Kval\u00f8ya, west of the Troms\u00f8ya island. The Troms\u00f8 Bridge and Troms\u00f8ysund Tunnel both cross the Troms\u00f8ysundet strait connecting the mainland with Troms\u00f8ya by road. On the western side of the city, the Sandnessund Bridge connects Troms\u00f8ya island with Kval\u00f8ya island.\nThere are many tall mountains within the municipality including Hamperokken, Jiehkkev\u00e1rri, Store Bl\u00e5mann, Store Fornestinden, and Tromsdalstinden. The Lyngen Alps mountain range lies along the Troms\u00f8-Lyngen municipal border. There are many islands within the municipality of Troms\u00f8 including Hilles\u00f8ya, Kval\u00f8ya, Rebbenes\u00f8ya, Ringvass\u00f8ya, Sommar\u00f8ya, and Troms\u00f8ya. There are also several fjords that are located in Troms\u00f8 including the Balsfjorden, Kaldfjorden, Malangen, and Ullsfjorden.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTroms\u00f8 experiences a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Dfc) as winter temperatures are just cold enough to qualify and the summer season is short. However, precipitation amount and pattern, with maximum precipitation in autumn and early winter, as well as lack of permafrost, are atypical for subarctic areas. Due to the ice-free Norwegian Sea and the westerlies bringing the mild air ashore, winter temperatures in Troms\u00f8 are moderated and extremely mild for the latitude. The climate could more accurately be described as \"continental maritime\" than a typical subarctic climate.Troms\u00f8 has reputation of accumulating a lot of snow in winter, but on the streets of the city ice often prevails, especially in the first half of the winter. Troms\u00f8's snowfall pattern is quite erratic and varies substantially between different winters. Thaws with rain in the polar night mid-winter are not uncommon, which melts or wets existing snow, often followed by chilly windy Arctic blasts, creating dangerous ice driving and walking conditions. It is common to see Troms\u00f8 inhabitants walking with spikes in their shoes and almost all cars use studded tires. The all-time record for snow depth was set on 29 April 1997, when the meteorological station on top of Troms\u00f8ya recorded 240 centimetres (94.5 in) of snow on the ground. In an average winter, Troms\u00f8 sees 160 days with at least 25 centimetres (10 in) of snow on the ground (based on 1970\u20132000 average and recorded at the meteorological office station on top of the island, 100 meters above sea level).The lowest temperature ever recorded is \u221218.4 \u00b0C (\u22121.1 \u00b0F) in February 1966. That is extremely mild for a location this far north, as it is about the same as the record cold for the entire state of Florida\u2014about 40 degrees latitude further south. However, at the airport, also in the city, the lowest ever recording is \u221220.1 \u00b0C (\u22124.2 \u00b0F) in February 1985. Despite being a full 10 degrees further north than the Norwegian capital, Oslo, winter temperatures are very similar. The \"midnight sun\" is above the horizon from 19 May to 27 July (71 days), and the period with continuous night lasts a bit shorter, polar night from 28 November to 14 January (48 days).\nSummers are rather cool, sometimes cloudy and rainy, and sometimes sunny, often with large variations from year to year and from month to month, depending on the weather pattern. However, for its latitude its summers are fairly warm, especially for a maritime location. Troms\u00f8 has recorded the sunniest month ever in Norway with 430 sunhours in July 1980, and also the sunniest spring month with 381 sunhours in May 2013. The highest temperature ever recorded at the met office 100 m amsl is 30.2 \u00b0C (86.4 \u00b0F) in July 1972. Outside the city, large areas in the municipality are above the treeline and have an alpine tundra climate. On the west coast of Kval\u00f8ya (Sommar\u00f8y), climate data show a mean annual temperature of 3.9 \u00b0C (39.0 \u00b0F), mostly because winters here are 2 \u00b0C (4 \u00b0F) warmer compared to the city, making this part of the municipality a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) zone. Troms\u00f8 has the distinction of being the northernmost city on earth where the average yearly low is above freezing.Recent years have seen warming, and there have been no overnight air frost in June since 1997.\n\n\n=== Light and darkness ===\n\nThe midnight sun occurs from about 18 May to 26 July, but mountains block the view of it for a few days, meaning that one can see the midnight sun from about 21 May to 21 July. Due to Troms\u00f8's high latitude, twilight is long, meaning there is no true night between March 27 and September 17.\nThe sun remains below the horizon during the polar night from about 26 November to 15 January, but due to the mountains, the sun is not visible from 21 November to 21 January. The return of the sun is an occasion for celebration. However, because of the twilight, there is some daylight for a couple of hours even around midwinter, often with bluish light, allowing for normal day/night cycles during the winter. The nights shorten quickly. By 21 February, the sun is above the horizon from 7:45 am to 4:10 pm and, by 1 April, is above the horizon from 5:50 am to 7:50 pm (daylight saving time). However, if one were to include astronomical twilight as \"not night\", then Troms\u00f8 only has 13 hours and 32 minutes of night on the winter solstice.\nThe combination of snow cover and sunshine often creates intense light conditions from late February until the snow melts in the lowland (usually late April), and sunglasses are essential when skiing. Because of these diametrically different light conditions in winter, Norwegians often divide it into two seasons: M\u00f8rketid (polar night) and Seinvinter (late winter).\nIt is possible to observe the aurora borealis (northern lights) from Troms\u00f8, as northern Norway is located in the auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Troms\u00f8 is often subject to cloudy conditions, which prevent aurorae being seen, even if they are present.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nTroms\u00f8 municipality includes these villages:\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe compact city centre has the biggest concentration of historic wooden houses north of Trondheim, and they co-exist with modern architecture. The houses date from 1789 to 1904, when building wooden houses was banned in the city centre, as in several other Norwegian cities. The oldest house in Troms\u00f8 is Skansen, built in 1789 on the remains of a 13th-century turf rampart.\n\nThe Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, situated in a wharf house from 1837, presents Troms\u00f8's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions. Troms\u00f8 Cathedral, Norway's only wooden cathedral, built in 1861, is located in the middle of the city, and so is the small Catholic church V\u00e5r Frue (\"Our Lady\"). Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915\u201316. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.The Arctic Cathedral, a modern church built in 1965, is situated on the mainland, facing the sound and city centre. The church, in reality a parish church and not a cathedral, was drawn by Jan Inge Hovig. The Polaria aquarium and experience centre from 1998 is a short walk south from the city centre. The Troms\u00f8 Museum is a university museum, presenting culture and nature of North Norway. The museum also displays the Arctic-alpine botanic garden, the world's northernmost botanical garden. A cable car goes up to mount Storsteinen, 420 metres (1,380 feet) above sea level, with a panoramic view over Troms\u00f8. The mountain Tromsdalstinden, 1,238 metres (4,062 ft), on the mainland, which is easily spotted from the city centre, is also a major landmark. At the top of Troms\u00f8ya is a lake called Prestvannet.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe Church of Norway has eight parishes (sokn) within the municipality of Troms\u00f8. It is part of the Troms\u00f8 domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland.\n\n\n== Government ==\nAll municipalities in Norway, including Troms\u00f8, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.  The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.  The municipality falls under the Nord-Troms District Court and the H\u00e5logaland Court of Appeal.\n\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Troms\u00f8 is made up of 43 representatives that are elected to four year terms.  Troms\u00f8 introduced so-called \"parliamentary rule\" in 2011. The Municipal council elects an executive body, byr\u00e5det (\"the city council\"), consisting of six byr\u00e5der (\"city councilors\"). At least in theory, these are equivalent to the cabinet members of a parliamentary government. The party breakdown of the council is as follows:\n\n\n=== Mayor ===\nThe mayor of Troms\u00f8 since 2015 has been Kristin R\u00f8ymo of the Labour Party.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nTroms\u00f8 is the largest fishing port in Norway. Secondary to fishing, the University of Troms\u00f8 is a center for Arctic research. Tourism has exploded as an alternative economic resource after Joanna Lumley featured the city in the BBC special \"Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights.\"\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nMore than 100 nationalities are represented in the population. Among the more prominent minorities are the Sami, Russians, and Finns, both the local Kvens (descendants of 19th century Finnish immigrants) and recent immigrants from Finland proper. The world's northernmost mosque is to be found in Troms\u00f8. Our Lady Catholic church is the seat of the world's northernmost Catholic Bishop, who leads the Territorial Prelature of Troms\u00f8. Although the local Catholic population is only 350 strong, Pope John Paul II visited this small church and stayed as a guest of the bishop in 1989.\n\n\n=== Sami population ===\nAs noted in the history section, the Troms\u00f8 area has long been a home to S\u00e1mi culture. The assimilation of the Coastal S\u00e1mi, however, led to the local S\u00e1mi culture becoming increasingly invisible in the Troms\u00f8 area during the 20th century. The 1970s, however, saw a revitalization of S\u00e1mi culture and identity, which also made itself felt in Troms\u00f8. Today there is a Sami kindergarten and Sami language classes in certain schools of Troms\u00f8. There have been attempts at countering the decline of the S\u00e1mi language for example through the establishment of a Sami language centre in Ullsfjord.\nTroms\u00f8 city has generally displayed a positive attitude to the indigenous minority culture, for example through municipally arranged celebrations of the S\u00e1mi People's Day, bilingual signs at the University, and when the city made its bid for the Winter Olympics the S\u00e1mi name of Troms\u00f8, Romsa, was included in the would-be logo of the event - which also incorporated an old S\u00e1mi symbol as its main element.\n\n\n=== 2011 language controversy ===\nIn 2011, however, the role of S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 became controversial. The Municipal Board had applied for Troms\u00f8 to join the S\u00e1mi Language Administrative Area. This would have entailed giving equal space to selected S\u00e1mi toponyms on signposts, allowing S\u00e1mi-speakers to communicate in their language with local authorities, and make means available from the S\u00e1mi Parliament for officials to learn S\u00e1mi. The political parties FrP, Venstre and H\u00f8yre, opposed the decision and made it a part of their election campaign to reverse it, claiming that Troms\u00f8 was \"a Norwegian city\" and hence it was natural neither to display S\u00e1mi toponyms along with Norwegian ones, nor make S\u00e1mi an official language along with Norwegian. The parties opposing a larger role for S\u00e1mi culture in Troms\u00f8 won the election and reversed the application. It has been claimed that the issue has \"divided\" Troms\u00f8's inhabitants between those who see S\u00e1mi culture as naturally belonging there and those who see it as alien to the area. During and after the election campaign, pro-S\u00e1mi politicians received threats and people wearing traditional S\u00e1mi garb claim to have been subjected to verbal abuse. In June 2013 the municipality nonetheless entered into a cooperation agreement with the S\u00e1mi Parliament which is intended to strengthen Sami language education and Sami culture in Troms\u00f8.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBeing the largest city in Northern Norway, Troms\u00f8 is a cultural centre for its region. It gained some international attention when on 11 June 2005 hosted one of six 46664 concerts, designed to put work concerning HIV/AIDS on the international agenda.\nMany cultural activities take place in Kulturhuset (English: lit. the culture house), including concerts by Troms\u00f8 Symphony Orchestra and plays by Troms\u00f8's professional theatre troupe, H\u00e5logaland Teater. The new theatre building was opened in November 2005. The city contains several museums. The largest are the Northern Norwegian Art Gallery (Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum) and the Troms\u00f8 Gallery of Contemporary Art (Troms\u00f8 Kunstforening).\n\nThe Troms\u00f8 techno scene is the origin of many of Norway's most important artists in electronic music, and Troms\u00f8 was a leading city at the early stages of the house and techno scene in Norway from the last part of the 1980s. The internationally recognized duo R\u00f6yksopp and the ambient electronic musician Geir Jennsen, known as Biosphere, are the most famous exports.\nThe record label Beatservice Records and the Insomnia Festival means Troms\u00f8 still leads the country in the development and promotion of the genre.\nThe local newspapers are Bladet Troms\u00f8 and Nordlys.\n\n\n== Festivals and celebrations ==\nBoth the Troms\u00f8 International Film Festival and Nordlysfestivalen (lit. the Aurora Borealis Festival), a classical music festival, are arranged in January. The end of that month is marked by the Day of the Sun (Soldagen), when the sun finally appears above the horizon after the Polar Night, which is celebrated, mainly by children. The International Day of the Sami People is celebrated at the University of Troms\u00f8 and the city hall on 6 February every year. Troms\u00f8's Latin American Festival, No Siesta Fiesta, is held at the end of February. It started in 2007 and showcases \"the best of Latin America\" in Northern Norway with film, dance, music, art, seminars, debates, markets, and a street Samba parade. Every autumn the Insomnia Festival for electronic music is hosted. It is one of the largest and most important festivals for electronic music and techno culture in Norway.\nThe Bukta Troms\u00f8 Open Air Festival, held in June and July, is a popular music festival. The Bukta festival is mainly a rock festival, but also features other kinds of modern music. The festival takes place in Telegrafbukta, a park on the south-western part of the Troms\u00f8ya island. Other popular cultural summer events among the population of Troms\u00f8 is the Karls\u00f8y festival and the Riddu Riddu festival, both held in the region surrounding the city.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nTroms\u00f8 is the home of many football clubs, of which the three most prominent are Troms\u00f8 IL, which plays in the Norwegian Premier League and is the world's northernmost Premier League football team, I.F. Fl\u00f8ya in the Norwegian First Division (women), and Tromsdalen U.I.L., playing in the Adeccoliga. Troms\u00f8 Midnight Sun Marathon is arranged every year in June and recently also a Polar Night Halfmarathon in January. The city is home to many clubs in the top division in various sports. Most notably basketball-outfit Troms\u00f8 Storm in the BLNO, BK Troms\u00f8 in the top volleyball league for men, and Troms\u00f8 Volley in the top volleyball league for women. The oldest sports club in Troms\u00f8 is Troms\u00f8 Turnforening, a gymnastics club founded in 1862, that also was the cradle of the before mentioned football club Troms\u00f8 IL.\nTroms\u00f8 was selected by the Norwegian National Olympic Committee as Norway's candidate for the 2018 Winter Olympics. This would have made Troms\u00f8 the first city north of the Arctic Circle to host the games. There were plans to use ships as the media village. In October 2008 the NOC suspended Troms\u00f8's bid, citing excessive costs. From the southern to the northern tip of the island Troms\u00f8ya, there is a floodlit cross country ski track. A ski jump is also situated on the island, close to the university.

          "This is a big bus tour, which has advantages and disadvantages. Personally we preferred the small group tour we went on as well. But here\u2019s our run down of Northern Shots: Advantages - Cheaper than a small tour - Professional photographer who will assist each person with camera",

          "We went on this trip last night and it was fantastic. Sebastian was very knowledgeable and explained everything about the lights and how they happen. We drove for about 90 minutes on a comfortable coach to find a clear and dark spot next to the sea. The walk to the beach was a",
          "So happy to be finally able to see Northern Lights! I went to Finland and I didn't manage to see it. The guides were very professional and they actually went around to teach us how to shoot the lights with our individual cameras. They also provided tripods in case you didn't",

          "I have to give this company credit, they did everything to give us the opportunity to see the Northern Lights and we did. The bus was big and clean. The tour guide was committed to her duty and had all the tech equipment to hunt down the lights....which eventually came out after",
          "This tour exceeded expectations. We were lucky and could see the NL even before the bus stopped. Our guide seemed well versed in finding the right spots and giving us helpful information. I wish they passed out flashlights as the walk to the beach was on uneven ground and it",
          "We went out on the bus tour on Wednesday the 7th of November. The bus was comfortable and I was grateful to have access to a restroom given we were unsure how long we would be out there for. Fortunately, we only had to travel about 45 minutes outside of the city before stopping",
          "We are very happy of having booked the aurora chase experience with NorthernShots Tours, not just because it was really well organised and the team was excellent, but also because the chances of seeing the aurora are a lot higher than trying on your own. We were lucky and saw",
          "We were in Tromso only for a night and we choose to do our tour with Northernshots. We started from the pickup point at around 6:10 and reached the choosen spot (in Finland) by around 8:10 pm. Our guides Milo and RJ were great and helped everyone to setup the cameras for night",

          "Although It's very difficult to actually see the auroras sometimes becuase you need clear skies and strong solar activity, Sebastian, Cristian, Milo and Laca managed to find really good spots to see them through my 3 consecutive day chase (I should have stayed longer in Tromso).",
          "We didn't quite know what to make of this tour. One would expect that one can see the Northern Lights on any clear night. So during our first night in Troms\u00f8 (with a clear sky) we looked, but didn't see anything (we thought). The next day we went to the Northern Shots office and",

          "We booked 2 nights to try to increase our chances First was with Emma - she was amazing. Very enthusiastic and knowledgable. Nothing was too much for her. Felt like she was reallying choosing places she loved. A great character and engaging. Saw great lights as we were patient!",
          "The hump backs had just arrived and we saw at least 7 and numerous orcas. There were orcas when we passed the rib boats but going on further the humpbacks were in shallower water than usual and came back up soon after diving. Lovely to be on a catamaran and on a dismal day there",
          "It was a very nice and comfortable trip with the Aurora Explorer. Unfortunately the weather was a little bit bad but nevertheless we saw loads of orcas and one humback whale. Not the best weather conditions for taking pictures. More cookies would be nice ;).",
          "We went on a Northern Lights tour only. Sadly we chose the wrong night - too much cloud and snowing. Artic Explorer did its best to find a gap in the clouds but to no avail! Iga our guide was fabulous though. She provided delicious hot chocolate and biscuits to keep us going.",
          "My son and I did the trip from Tromso about \u00a3100 each so not cheap but we sailed into whale island fjord and saw humpbacks orcas, eagles fantastic day the weather was a little rough on the way back but as it will be dark in the winter months they played a film about the orca",
          "A wonderful experience. Loads of Orcas, Humpback wales and eagles to be seen. Iga, the tour guide, was friendly and knowledgable. The boat was very comfortable with free hot drinks and a lovely clean warm suit provided. I would recommend this highly to anyone and hope to return",
          "Went on the trip last wednesday,unfortunatly the sea conditions were very rough and no whales were seen.The staff informed us we could have a return trip free which we did on friday and what a difference .I lost count off the number of orcas and humpback whales we saw and so",
          "Iva and crew looked after us really well on this comfy warm well equipped boat. We had a good briefing on the whales and motored a long way out with huge rewards, finding a real feeding frenzy of Orcas and several humpbacks. Whales wherever you looked! Also sea eagles were a",
          "We went whale watching with this company and it was amazing. From the scenery to the tour guide, Iga, teaching all about the different whales on the journey to see them, the entire trip was well worth it.",
          "Took a whale watching trip with Arctic explorer. Nice big boat with cozy warm interior, FOC coffee, tea and biscuits. It can get pretty windy outside, best to use their arctic suits when you need to stay on the decks for longer. Staff is knowledgeable and gave details regarding",
          "We had the most amazing time whale watching with Iga and the crew. We saw loads of orca and quite a few humpback whales. The boat was comfortable with free tea, coffee and biscuits. Also had the use of artic suits which were definitely needed. Only wish we were here longer",
          "Excellent experience! Iga and team did the utmost to ensure we were well informed and were able to enjoy the spectacular sights of humpback whales and orcas. We saw multiple pods of orcas and about 6 humpback whales.",
          "I took the whale watching safari on Monday, November 28 2016. The boat was very large and held a goodly amount of people. The staff were very friendly and very excited about the whales that they watch. They gave us excellent information about the Orcas and Humpbacks that we",
          "I took my girlfriend whale watching for her birthday and it couldn't have been better. The excellent crew gave full briefings and an in depth chat about the different whales. The boat itself was a perfect size for the amount of guests. The ride through the fjords were perfect",
          "Great group to be with!!! Iga is a great tour guide - so welcoming and warm. We were able to see the lights on our night even though the skies were a bit challenging. Scenery was beautiful and well worth the trip. Our group ended up also going whale watching the next",
          "Had a lovely time on the boat for whale watching. The boat was very comfortable with suits for the wind. We managed to catch both orcas and humpbacks from really close without intruding their feeding time like other boats. They gave a student discount as well with free tea and",
          "We had three whale watching tours with Artic Explorer. Two on the catamaran and one on the RIB. Both were brilliant. The crew were very friendly and welcoming. We got the best of both worlds with the RIB tour as by the time we were heading back to Tromso I was cold and wanted to",
          "We went on the large boat whale watching today.. it was utterly Incredible! We saw humpback whales, they were quite shy but on the way back we stopped and saw one very close up. We saw lots of orca feeding. Was brilliant with the warm waterproof suits and delicious waffles on",
          "right from the start as the catamaran left exactly on time we thought we were in for a good trip. We were wrong - it was a fantastic trip. The catamaran was warm and clean and got us quickly and comfortably to the whale areas. Liga, our guide, was brilliant in explaining about",
          "I had an amazing time with Arctic Explorers on their Northern Lights Cruise and whale watching on their RIB boat. Both were an unforgettable experience. Everyone I met at the company was so energy, happy and wanted to make sure we have an incredible time. They were so",
          "Blog Entries Day 1 - I have arrived! Today I have put up my tent I have already started to socialize with other people they shouted at me while I was doing my job because I made a mistake in making fire and tomorrow we are going climb the 1 of tallest mountains in the world I",
          "Amazing guides, amazing views and a lot of whales. The boat was nice and cosy and we also got suits to wear outside. We would stay warm and we also got free coffee, tea and cookies. They were really helpful and it was an once-in-a-lifetime experience!",
          "We booked an evening northern lights trip for my birthday with this company and spent the evening in the company of our tour advisors Iga and Isobel who were just delightful. We didn't see the lights that night but had a lovely trip nevertheless. A couple of days later we went",
          "We chose to go on a whale safari with Arctic Explorer (not Arctic Explorers as there is another company with an 's' at the end!) as it was recommended by another tour operator. We were happy that we did because Arctic Explorer respect the whales. When we were out in the fjords,",
          "What a day! While there are many different whale-watching options, we chose this boat because it was a larger vessel. Warm and cozy inside and lots of room for outside viewing. Obviously, the whales decide if they're going to be there or not. On our tour, they decided to come in",
          "We had a great day with them as we saw lot of whales and northern lights aswell. On a road trip you mostly get to see one leg of the lights but from sea you see the entire belt of light in the form of a semicircle like a rainbow.I would recommend road trip for steady pictures",
          "If it's a safe and informative whale watching trip you're after then without doubt I would recommend joining Iga and the crew onboard the Aurora Explorer. Iga's enthusiasm and knowledge of both orca and humpback whales was totally infectious. The free hot drinks that were",
          "We were in Tromso for the Northern lights and while we were there, we took a bunch of day trips. We went whale watching on two separate occasions; once on the rib boat and once on the catamaran. We took the rib boat on the 31st of October. While the day was bright and sunny, it",
          "Booked with Arctic Explorer (note this is different to Arctic Explorers) because they offered a longer cruise (4hrs) at the same or cheaper price than other providers and we reasoned that this could only increase our chances of seeing the aurora. Booked through the Tromso",
          "The very comfortable Aurora catamaran was skillfully staffed by all of the friendly crew. The trip out of Tromso Fjord in the morning sunlight was almost worth the fee alone. The Sea Eagles soaring above the mountains were only an introduction to a stunning display of wildlife.",
          "Comfortable boat with a friendly and knowledgeable crew. The weather was perfect and we soon came across a pod of orcas, which we followed at a respectful distance for long enough to enjoy them and get plenty of photos. All in all a really good trip that I'd recommend to anyone.",
          "First of all a big thanks to the super friendly staff, they did a great job! We got to see al lot of Orcas and it was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend this tour to everyone visiting Troms\u00f8!",
          "We arrived few days before the whale watching season began, so there were no many tours offering whale watching, but we knew first orcas had arrived, so we decided to take the risk, knowing that is nature and only a few has arrived, so we find this tour thanks to other tour that",
          "Excellent service. Excellent experience. IGA was an outstanding guide and the Orca Whales we got to see made this experience unforgettable. Highly recommended.",
          "Inga and the rest of the Artic Explorer team were brilliant! Very informative and experienced staff who looked after us fo4 this 4hr excursion. Watching Orcas in there natural state and habitat was an unbelievable experience. They are such confident animals that we were able",
          "Wanted to say a big thank you to Arctic Explorer. I've been whale watching before, and this was much better. The Orca's danced for us for over an hour. The boat was comfortable and our guide Iga shared down to earth fun facts about the Orcas. Would highly recommend and would",
          "The night before I went on a challenging chase of the Northern Lights by car (where we had to camp out in the snow in the middle of nowhere), so I found this tour to be more comfortable \ud83d\ude0c Our Arctic Explorer guide told us it's okay for us to sit inside the cabin and be all",
          "We booked this tour at the last minute when other plans fell through and it was our last day in Svalbard. We were really glad that we did. We had heard that there had been polar bear sightings on the Pyramiden glacier for several days so we thought we would try our luck. On",
          "The katamaran Aurora Explorer does half-day trips to Barentsburg and Pyramiden- the Russian settlements on Svalbard. We chose the Pyramiden since we had been to Barentsburg several times before. The boat was far from full, very nice guides/crew on board with lots of information",
          "My girlfriend and I went from the 8-10.06.2016 from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg and we had difficulties with the tour Operator Arctic Explorer in Svalbard. On the way there we had no problem but on our return trip we didn t get picked up, and nobody, if we could get a hold with",

          "We went on the night fjord tour and were happy to have the best view of the lights that night. After 2 nights of unsuccessful northern lights tours, this was a blessing. I liked that seeing the lights from a boat, you had the option to sit downstairs and stay warm, have a coffee",
          "The guys were hospitable and fun. They can't make the Northern Lights appear BUT if they could ... they would.",
          "Arrived at dock for our trip to be led away from the boat we were so posed to have been taken out on, arrived at a much smaller vessel ,which didn't look big enough for our size party, the skipper rowed with the girl saying to many he rang his boss who told him to take us,",
          "We took this tour in January, sadly we didn\u00b4t see any orcas, but we saw a lot of humpback whales, which made it a great experience! We got extra layer of clothes and hot tea to keep us warm, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, I highly recommend this company.",
          "We did the 4 Hour fjord day cruise. Restart wasn't the best as they had off-line and so needed to persuade some people to take a later sailing (albeit at a discounted rate). That said the crew handled it well and were very apologetic and the one who was the guide was helpful and",
          "A long and beautiful ride in the fjords that turned into meeting with a family of orcas! hugely emotion, a wonderful surprise that will remain forever in our memory!",
          "We booked in with the Artic Explorers for Whale Watching and on that aspect they did not disappoint. We manage to witness a number of Orcas and Hump Back Whales in their natural environment which was a truly unforgettable experience. However, this tour lacked personality, charm",
          "My girlfriend and I went on this trip on 28th of January. We booked two months in advance an we paid onboard. The trip began with safety procedures and some information about the whale. After only 10min. we left the Harbour we have seen the first whale! That day we have seen",
          "Alas! We saw whales with so much ease and for a long duration! The sea was calm and it was a great experience with Arctic Explorer! We have done whale watching in many countries and invariably, it is only a gamble. In Tromso, we couldn't believe that there are so many Humpback",
          "My wife and I used this company for our whale watching excursion in late January. It was a bit late in the \"season\" for this activity, but we gave it a shot. As luck would have it, the weather this day was the only truly poor weather we had during our two weeks in Norway.",
          "Liga and the crew were very informative and friendly. We had not the chance to see orcas, but despite being in the very end of the season, we have still seen some humblebacks. And the landscapes all around were unforgettable, we have taken a lot of fabulous photographs. So we",
          "Went whale watching on the last day of our holiday, which just happened to be the last day of whale watching, very informative crew, which made the trip far more entertaining, we met up with a pod of killer whales plus a couple of humpbacks, totally enthralling, what was",
          "When the lights don't play this is a very dull 4 hours indeed. The hostess was attentive and there were hot drinks and biscuits. We had some dim light activity about half an hour into the trip but then nothing else. If the lights oblige this would be 5* however!",
          "Northern Lights Cruise - We went out on the big catamaran as there was about 30 people ( smaller boat only takes 24). Female guide very helpful and friendly. Boat comfortable, and you can help yourself to free tea/coffee/biscuits throughout the trip. Unfortunately the night we",
          "Awesome, went on last day of holiday to tromso. Big catamaran with very helpful and informative crew around kvaloya island through the fjords to sommaroy, humpbacks and orcas. A truly magical trip with memories for life. Thanks Arctic explorer",
          "We went whale watching with Arctic Explorer on 2 successive days - we were so impressed on the first day that we repeated the experience the next. Whilst far from cheap - \u00a380 or so for a 5 hour trip - there is a good chance of close up sightings. We saw orcas and humpbacks off",
          "We weren't expecting to see very much as it was coming towards the end of the season and others we had spoken to hadn't seen very much but we wanted to give it ago just in case! We were on quite a large boat but they still managed to make it feel very personal. The tour guide",
          "very good equipped catamaran took us out on a 5 hours excursion towards whale island. very comfortable seats, thermo-clothing available, good and plenty of information about the area, about whales and birdlife. Free coffee, tea and biscuits to warm up after a time outside on",

          "I went on a Northern Lights boat tour with the Arctic explorer. It was a truly amazing experience! First, the ship went to a calm and dark spot far outside of Troms\u00f8. Everyone was equipped with thermal suits. And hot drinks were included. Then we waited for the Northern Lights",
          "Watching the whales was a last minute decision for us as we thought they would have left by end of January. But we were lucky! So we booked the trip from our hotel and the departure was literally outside out hotel! Very convenient if your hotel is near the water front. We",

          "I was going out with Arctic Explorers three days in a row now and every day was special, every day was different but every day was great fun! It was a lifetime experience to see these wonderful mammals sleeping, jumping, feeding in big numbers and to enjoy being close to them.",
          "An enjoyable morning on the boat and a great opportunity to see Whales up close! We did get to see quite a number and it would have been enhanced for me if they had surfaced just that little bit more - but, that's nature, unpredictable! Well worth the trip and the boat very",
          "This is a good way to see the whales in comfort - large catamaran with a cabin as well as outside viewing - I am not a great sailor and this was a very comfortable trip. If you don't have warm enough clothing they will supply protection suits to keep you warmer. Coffee and",
          "Me and my fiance did both the northern lights and whale safari cruises the same day, we were pleased with the knowledge and experience of both trips. The crew are very friendly, will be returning to tromso and happy to be onboard with them again. Thanks for the photo and the",

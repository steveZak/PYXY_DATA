        "wiki": "Saqsaywaman, which can be spelled many different ways  (possibly from Quechua language, waman falcon or variable hawk), is a citadel on the northern outskirts of the city of Cusco, Peru, the historic capital of the Inca Empire. Sections were first built about 1100 CE by the Killke culture which had occupied the area since 900 CE. \nThe complex was expanded and added to by the Inca from the 13th century; they built dry stone walls constructed of huge stones. The workers carefully cut the boulders to fit them together tightly without mortar. The site is at an altitude of 3,701 m (12,142 ft).\nIn 1983, Cusco and Sacsayhuam\u00e1n together were designated as sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for international recognition and protection. \n\n\n== Description ==\nLocated on a steep hill that overlooks the city, the fortified complex has a wide view of the valley to the southeast. Archeological studies of surface collections of pottery at Sacsayhuam\u00e1n indicate that the earliest occupation of the hilltop dates to about 900 CE .\nAccording to Inca oral history, Tupac Inca \n\n\"remembered that his father Pachacuti had called city of Cuzco the lion city.  He said that the tail was where the two rivers unite which flow through it, that the body was the great square and the houses round it, and that the head was wanting.\"The Inca decided the \"best head would be to make a fortress on a high plateau to the north of the city.\" But archeologists have determined that Sacsayhuam\u00e1n was originally built by the preceding Killke culture. Beginning about the 13th century, the Inca expanded on this monumental construction. \nAfter the Battle of Cajamarca during the Spanish Conquest of the Inca, Francisco Pizarro sent Martin Bueno and two other Spaniards to transport the gold and silver from the Temple of Coricancha in Cusco to Cajamarca, where the Spaniards were based.   They found the Temple of the Sun \"covered with plates of gold\", which the Spanish ordered removed as payment for Atahualpa's ransom.  Seven hundred plates were removed, and added to two hundred cargas of gold transported back to Cajamarca.  The royal mummies, draped in robes, and seated in gold embossed chairs, were left alone.  But, while desecrating the temple, Pizarro's three men also defiled the Virgins of the Sun, sequestered women who were considered sacred and served at the temple.After Francisco Pizarro finally entered Cuzco, his brother Pedro Pizarro described what they found, \n\n\"on top of a hill they [the Inca] had a very strong fort surrounded with masonry walls of stones and having two very high round towers.  And in the lower part of this wall there were stones so large and thick that it seemed impossible that human hands could have set them in place...they were so close together, and so well fitted, that the point of a pin could not have been inserted in one of the joints.  The whole fortress was built up in terraces and flat spaces.\"  The numerous rooms were \"filled with arms, lances, arrows, darts, clubs, bucklers and large oblong shields...there were many morions...there were also...certain stretchers in which the Lords travelled, as in litters.\" Pedro Pizarro described in detail storage rooms that were within the complex and filled with military equipment.\nThe large plaza, capable of holding thousands of people, was designed for communal  ceremonial activities. Several of the large structures at the site may also have been used during rituals. A similar relationship to that between Cuzco and Sacsayhuam\u00e1n was replicated by the Inca in their distant colony where Santiago, Chile developed. The Inca fortress there, known as Chena, predated the Spanish colonial city. It was a ceremonial ritual site known as Huaca de Chena.The best-known zone of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n includes its great plaza and its adjacent three massive terrace walls. The stones used in the construction of these terraces are among the largest used in any building in pre-Hispanic America. They display a precision of cutting and fitting that is unmatched in the Americas. The stones are so closely spaced that a single piece of paper will not fit between many of the stones. This precision, combined with the rounded corners of the blocks, the variety of their interlocking shapes, and the way the walls lean inward, is thought to have helped the ruins survive devastating earthquakes in Cuzco. The longest of the three walls is about 400 meters. They are about 6 meters tall. The estimated volume of stone is over 6,000 cubic meters. Estimates for the weight of the largest andesite block vary from 128 tonnes to almost 200 tonnes.Following the siege of Cusco, the Spaniards began to use Sacsayhuam\u00e1n as a source of stones for building Spanish Cuzco; within a few years, they had taken apart and demolished much of the complex. The site was destroyed block by block to salvage materials with which to build the new Spanish governmental and religious buildings of the colonial city, as well as the houses of the wealthiest Spaniards. In the words of Garcilaso de la Vega (1966:471 [1609: Part 1, Book. Bk. 7, Ch. 29]): \n\n\"to save themselves the expense, effort and delay with which the Indians worked the stone, they pulled down all the smooth masonry in the walls. There is indeed not a house in the city that has not been made of this stone, or at least the houses built by the Spaniards.\"Today, only the stones that were too large to be easily moved remain at the site.On 13 March 2008, archaeologists discovered additional ruins at the periphery of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n. They are believed to have been built by the Killke culture, which preceded the Inca. While appearing to be ceremonial in nature, the exact function remains unknown. This culture built structures and occupied the site for hundreds of years before the Inca, between 900 and 1200 CE.In January 2010, parts of the site were damaged during periods of heavy rainfall in the region.\n\n\n== Modern-day use ==\nPeruvians continue to celebrate Inti Raymi, the annual Inca festival of the winter solstice and new year. It is held near Sacsayhuam\u00e1n on 24 June. Another important festival is Warachikuy, held there annually on the third Sunday of September.Some people from Cusco use the large field within the walls of the complex for jogging, t'ai chi, and other athletic activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nList of megalithic sites\nHuaca de Chena\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBBC Article New Discoveries at Sacsayhuam\u00e1n",

          "This is the place for Inca walls. A large complex of walls, building remains, gateways and related features above Cusco. This is an essential visit for the area. If you have heard of the delicate, complex fitting of huge stone blocks into Inca walls, then it was probably done here. You must visit.",

          "We came here with a tour guide who was very knowledgeable and told us the history of this area, along with Cusco.

          "I really enjoyed walking around these ruins. It had a great view of Cusco too. We originally were going to walk up to the ruins from Cusco but glad we didn't as it was very uphill. I wish we would've known about the local bus instead of \u2026",
          "Amazing site. Nice for a quiet wander. Allow plenty of time",
          "Beautiful! Having visited this site twice now with different guests and different guides, I would say this is a can't miss. Only a few minutes taxi ride or a short, but strenuous walk out of the center of town, Sacsaywaman offers a unique \u2026",
          "Amazing place..visit if you can.",
          "My husband called this place \"Machu Picchu light\" because it was so easy to get to.",
          "Incredible Inca holy site. There was a functioning water reservoir here that provided water to the Inca capitol of Cusco. The Incas used specially cut stones to build images of sacred animals in to the wall. There is also an immense stone \u2026",
          "Awesome place to visit! It is a sacrate site, also it is worth it to pay a guide. :)",
          "It's mush smaller than other sites.  Also years older than ZMachu Picchu ruins.  Or so our guide said if you could believe anything she said",
          "On our second visit we really had a chance to fully appreciate the scope of this ruin. Views overlooking Cusco are most impressive. Intrigued to learn people did not live here and the theory presented is that it was a religious center, not a fortress.",
          "Must see! Find your private guide and explore this Inca wonder.",
          "I recommend this place, great experience!!!",
          "Magnificent! Exceptional because of the sometimes gigantic monoliths that the Incas have used to build the walls of the fort. Razor-sharp and cementless joints demonstrate the extraordinary building qualities of this civilization.",
          "Possibly Cusco's top sight.  Inca-redible history and views!",
          "Great historical Inca site",
          "It is an awesome place. The Cucco ticket gives you access to a lot of places. And this is one of them.",
          "Must visit if in cusco, beware of the horse guys, they take poor care and ride them all day. tell them about it.",
          "Nicely kept park. But is 70 soles / 20 usd per person...",
          "I have been visiting this amazing place several times. Cusco is situated high and beautiful in the Andes. The city's history goes back several millennia. Many attach the credit to the Incas for the origin, but it is quite unlikely. The \u2026",
          "Bigger stones than Machu Picchu! Such a cool place!",
          "Definitely worth the visit.",
          "Definitely worth a visit, massive site so make sure you have at least 2 hours plus to see it all!",
          "I liked this better than Machu Picchu.",
          "It is unbelievable to see those huge stones there... Makes you wonder how they got there. Incredible workmanship and skill, huge testament to the Incas",
          "No maps. No displays. Really no help understanding the history. For 70 sol, they should provide better instructions. At the check in, they said it takes 2-3 hours for all 4 sites but the distance between Tambomachay and the main entrance is 1.5 hour walk one way. This was a total waste of money.",
          "A must visit while in Cusco. Children under 10 are free. Recommend you enter from the high entrance and exit on the lower entrance where you can enjoy a short walk down hill to the city center.",
          "It's an amazing archeological park just a few minutes from Plaza de Armas un Cusco.",
          "Absolutely loved this hike and the views.",

          "Amazing ! \nBetter than Machu Pichu ! \nIn Cuzco so access is pretty easy and it also offers an amazing view of Cuzco.",
          "The price might have been too much for partial park entrance. S/70 per ticket. \ud83d\ude0f",
          "Entry fee of 70 Soles per person is ridiculous!!! Total tourist gouging which is very upsetting. If you can handle that the complex is huge and impressive with amazing massive rocks carved to perfection. If you are going to Machu Pichu though you will see more there so this is not a necessary visit.",
          "We taxied up and walked down hill to this wonderful site.  An amazing place and recommend visiting and spending some time if you are in Cusco.",
          "Interesting. Vast place with great views across Cusco. Close to Cristo Blanco statue. Great exercise if you walk up to it.",
          "Historical place you must visit to understand a bit more Inca's culture.",
          "Amazing place - take the time to visit here if you are able while in Cusco. Very  large and spread out but easy to walk. Most is flat unless you want to go into the hilly areas. Helps to have a guide as there is not much signage. Also try \u2026",
          "Amazing Inca architecture that can't denied their knowledge and skills.",
          "Very nice old archeological site. It is nice too see the old and quite huge stone construction. If you go there with a tour (\"city tour\" there might not be enough time to take photos and the cultural information.\nBut for taking pictures \u2026",
          "Inca Empire ruins.The citadel is constructed by dry stone. \nAproximately altitute: 3700m/12000feet.\nThe Saqsaywaman archaeological complex has an area of 3,000 hectares and is located North of Cusco and is controlled by the National \u2026",
          "Great place to \"feel small\". Sometimes you need to be reminded how previous civilizations dwarfed our own building skills. Our guide Carlos was amazing and am happy to connect you to him if you'd like.",

          "Loved it... Awesome place!",
          "Unbelievably huge and complex military ruins. I spent at least two hours walking the grounds, taking pictures, and picking my jaw up off the ground. There\u2019s even a natural rock slide for the kids to play on! Don\u2019t miss the quarry area and caves too.",
          "Very nice place for visit in cusco..!",
          "Saqsaywaman is one the many ruins of the Inka,s town and Temples.",
          "Not only is it expensive but if you walk here from the city be prepared to be hounded constantly by people selling horseback tours and other nonsense. Skip it.",
          "They only offer a 70 soles combination ticket for this and other locations, no single ticket available. So if you just want to see this place you will have to pay this expensive ticket. I decided to leave since I saw already the other \u2026",
          "Breathtaking structures to look at and cute llamas laying about",
          "Free ruins! Just a little hike up from Cusco. If you get a chance hire a local guide with a horse (affordable and easier to navigate at high elevation).",
          "We thoughly enjoyed our day at. Get a guide and Saqsaywaman comes alive. Well worth the 50 Sol we paid. There's a small cave you can walk through over on the Earth Mother side and some rocks for the kids to slide down. Worth checking out, then walk 15 minutes up the hill to Qenko!",
          "If you plan to walk there be prepared for a fairly long  hike at high altitude. Make sure you are acclimatized first. But the hike there was nice, getting to see some more of the city and a beautiful view of cusco from the top. The site \u2026",
          "Impressive stone walls, MP doesn't have",
          "This is a great place to go! It has amazingly big stones in its structure in a large complex built over 500 years ago. Once in Cusco, this is a must.",
          "Wonderful place, always great to go back \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Amazing experience! It was wonderful seeing the ruins and learning about more Incan history. I definitely recommend this destination!",
          "Didn't enter. Tickets are 40 usd (Lots of reviews saying 70 soles; as far as I understand that's the student price). The Acropolis cost less and I didn't enter because it was too expensive.\n\nLots of people outside trying to sell you stuff. Avoid like the plague.",
          "Sprawling remains of ancient Inca city, really interesting and good to explore for several hours. Make sure to check out the rock slides!",
          "Its a beautiful place.  Perfect place to go for a few hours of your day in Cusco!",
          "Not much to see but worth the hike for the views and to wander in a green area above the city crowds. The ruins are all roped off but you can easily see the different areas (essentially groupings of rocks in what appear to be outlines of \u2026",

          "Would have been interesting to see if it wasn't that expensive. You cannot buy individual entry tickets, only tickets for multiple sights together. You can still walk around it though. And it has an amazing history.",
          "Beautiful wall and viewpoint overlooking Cusco! There\u2019s always so many alpacas roaming around, and the park/area is enormous, and guides are walking around if you\u2019re interested in the tour. Can spend up to 2 hours there.",

          "So amazing  , be there , and you will get more questions than answers...",

          "Incredible rocks and examples of Incan systems",
          "Our guide said what is left is only about 20% left of the temple.  Most stones were taken away by the Spanish to build the Santo Domingo church.",

          "There are at least 3 entrances take a cab ask him to drop you off at highest point  , the City entrance is a steep climb to the site exit your visit  there  .bring water expect 2 hours 30 minutes visit minimum more like 4 if you do look at everything .",
          "Worth a visit, don\u2019t forget your poncho!",
          "Really impressive! Among Tambomachay, Puka Pukara, Qenqo and Saqsaywaman; this last one is a must to visit. Considered till now a mistery of the planet because of its structure with up to 125 tones of granite stone. :D",

          "Saqsaywaman is a truly impressive feat of human willpower and engineering.  The stones there are HUGE and imposing, yet all of it set up by hand.  Arguably the biggest reason that this location isn't better known than Machu Picchu is \u2026",
          "Excellent archaeological site. The stonework here is 2nd to none, the views over Cusco are excellent, and if you're lucky you'll be able to mingle with some Alpacas. Worth the trip!",
          "Great place to visit, not too far from center.\n\nTicket can cost between 70 soles and 130 soles depending how many attractions you want to visit apart from Saqsaywaman. \n\nIf you are happy paying an extra for it, there are some guides in the \u2026"

In the central region of Mexico this space is known as El Z\u00f3calo and in Central America as Parque Central (Central Park). While some large cities have both a Plaza de Armas and a Plaza Mayor, in most cities those are two names for the same place.\nMost cities constructed by the Spanish conquistadores were designed in a standard military fashion, based on a grid pattern taken from the Roman castrum, of which one of the blocks would be left vacant to form the Plaza de Armas.  It is often surrounded by governmental buildings, churches, and other structures of cultural or political significance. The name derives from the fact that this would be a refuge in case of an attack upon the city, from which arms would be supplied to the defenders.\n\n\n== Main examples of Plaza de Armas in the Hispanic world ==\nPlaza de Armas of Guatemala\nPlaza de Armas of Arequipa, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Ayacucho, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Cajamarca, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Cusco, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Hu\u00e1nuco, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Ambo, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Guadalajara, Mexico\nPlaza de Armas of Havana, Cuba\nPlaza de Armas of Lima, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Manila, Philippines\nPlaza de Armas of Pisco, Peru\nPlaza de Armas of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico\nPlaza de Armas of San Antonio, United States\nPlaza de Armas of San Juan, Puerto Rico\nPlaza de Armas of Santiago, Chile\nPlaza de Armas of Trujillo, Peru\n\n\n== Public transit stations ==\nPlaza de Armas metro station in Santiago, Chile\nPlaza de Armas in Seville, Spain\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPlace-d'Armes (disambiguation), French equivalent",

        "wiki": "Coricancha, Koricancha, Qoricancha or Qorikancha (\"The Golden Temple,\" from Quechua quri gold; kancha enclosure) was the most important temple in the Inca Empire.  It is located in Cusco, Peru, which was the capital of the empire.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally named Intikancha or Intiwasi, it was dedicated to Inti, and is located at the former Inca capital of Cusco.  Most of the temple was destroyed after the 16th-century war with the Spanish conquistadors, as settlers also took it apart to build their own churches and residences. Much of its stonework was used as the foundation for the seventeenth-century Santo Domingo Convent. It was built after the 1650 earthquake destroyed the first Dominican convent.\nTo construct Coricancha, the Inca used ashlar masonry, building from the placement of similarly sized cuboid stones that they had cut and shaped for this purpose. The use of ashlar masonry made the temple much more difficult to construct, as the Inca did not use any stone with a slight imperfection or break. By choosing this masonry type, the Inca intentionally demonstrated the importance of the building through the extent of the labor necessary to build the structure. Through the arduous labor needed to construct buildings with ashlar masonry, this form of construction came to signify the Inca's imperial power to mobilize and direct local labor forces. The replication throughout Andean South America of Inca architectural techniques, such as those employed at Coricancha, expressed the extent of Inca control over a vast geographic region.Pachakutiq Inca Yupanqui rebuilt Cusco and the House of the Sun, enriching it with more oracles and edifices, and adding plates of fine gold.  He provided vases of gold and silver for the Mama-cunas, nuns or cloistered women, to use in the veneration services.  Finally, he took the bodies of the seven deceased Incas and adorned them with masks, head-dresses, medals, bracelets, and sceptres of gold, placing them on a golden bench.The walls were once covered in sheets of gold, and the adjacent courtyard was filled with golden statues. Spanish reports tell of an opulence that was \"fabulous beyond belief\". When the Spanish in 1533 required the Inca to raise a ransom in gold for the life of their leader Atahualpa, most of the gold was collected from Coricancha.The Spanish colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo on the site, demolishing the temple and using its foundations for the cathedral. They also used parts of the building for other churches and residences. Construction took most of a century. This is one of numerous sites where the Spanish incorporated Inca stonework into the structure of a colonial building. Major earthquakes severely damaged the church, but the Inca stone walls, built out of huge, tightly interlocking blocks of stone, still stand due to their sophisticated stone masonry. Nearby is an underground archaeological museum that contains mummies, textiles, and sacred idols from the site.\n\n\n== Inca astronomy ==\n\nSimilarities are found in the semicircular temples found in the Temple of the Sun in Cusco, the Torreon in Machu Picchu, and the Temple of the Sun in P\u00edsac.  In particular, all three exhibit a \"parabolic enclosure wall\" of the finest stonework, as Bingham describes it.  These structures were also used for similar purposes, including the observation of solstices and Inca constellations.\nWithin the Milky Way, which the Inca called mayu or Celestial River, the Inca distinguished dark area or clouds, which they called yana phuyu.  These were considered silhouettes or shadows of animals drinking from the river water.  Amongst the animals named by the Inca, was a llama extended from Scorpius to Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri, in which those two stars formed the llama's eyes, or llamacnawin.  A baby llama, llama-cria, was inverted underneath.  To the left of the llamas is a red-eyed fox, atoq, which lies between Sagittarius and the tail of Scorpius.  The tail of Scorpius is known as a storehouse, or qullqa.  A partridge, yutu, was just below the Southern Cross, and a toad, hamp'atu, to the lower right.  A serpent, machaguay, extends off to the right.During the Inti Raymi, the Sapa Inca and curacas would proceed from the Haucaypata, where they greeted the rising June solstice sun, to the inner court of the Coricancha.  On a bench in the \"sun room\", the Sapa Inca sat with the mummies of his ancestors.  This and other rooms were oriented northeast\u2013southwest, shingled in gold plate, and embedded with emeralds and turquoise.  Focusing the sun's rays with a concave mirror, the Sapa Inca would light a fire for the burnt sacrifice of llamas.  Children were also sacrificed in certain circumstances; they were brought to Cusco following a ceque and huaca route of tribute.The Coricancha is located at the confluence of two rivers.  Here, according to Inca myth, is where Manco C\u00e1pac decided to build the Coricancha, the foundation of Cusco, and the eventual Inca Empire.  According to Ed Krupp, \"The Inca built the Coricancha at the confluence because that place represented terrestrially the organizing pivot of heaven.\"\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nConvent of Santo Domingo, Cusco\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPedro Cieza de Leon's The Chronicle of Peru\nInca Garcilaso de la Vega's Comentarios Reales de los Incas\nFelipe Guam\u00e1n Poma de Ayala's The First New Chronicle and Good Government\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nTourism in Peru\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Qurikancha at Wikimedia Commons\n\u201cThe Political Force of Images,\u201d Vistas: Visual Culture in Spanish America, 1520-1820.",

          "Forget about the Cathedral. Visit this inca complex converted by the ruthless conquistadores... Open up your mind!!!",
          "So, here's the thing. I ended up going to this site twice, quite by mistake. The first time was in the morning on my own, while strolling around the city. The second time was with my tour group in the afternoon (it wasn't in the description of the itinerary). In the morning,",
          "The inside itself didn't have much other than empty rooms which were ruins. However, the gardens were beautiful and a nice place to sit and enjoy the views.",
          "Our tour guide was Jessie, who was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. This tour was a complete plus for my trip to Cusco.",
          "The Qorikancha Palace was once the center of the Inca Empire. It was literally lined and laced with gold. So, of course, the Spanish Conquistadors sacked it, destroyed it and built a church in its place. The juxtaposition of ancient and colonial makes for a compelling visit.",
          "Built literally as the \"temple at the center of the world\" during the Inca period the stones that survive as the foundation for the Convento de Santo Domingo testify to the excellence of the stone masons. The artifacts that survived the conquistadores are very few but are well",

          "When you travel around downtown Cusco, you may wonder what this huge church really is. It is located next to a large park that you can see off the El Sol Avenue. The church itself is on Ahuacpinta. The building is huge and contains quite the art gallery but what is really",

          "We walked to the baroque Convento de Santo Domingo del Cusco from our hotel. Built on massive granite Inca foundations, it was once the temple of the Sun. The adult ticket was 15 soles and the student ticket was 8 soles. The whole site is stunningly beautiful; art everywhere and",
          "Not to be missed if you are in Cuzco, both for the Inca ruins still preserved inside and for the Spanish building build on the top of it.",
          "We enjoyed the interesting bits of history there, and though there were English translations, I would recommend that the museum get someone who speaks English as a first language to tidy up the translations. Glad we made it there. We got the full 16 site pass - very worth the",
          "We tried visiting on multiple occasions but never succesfully made it here during opening hours. During the holiday season they are not quite as accessible. Beware.",
          "Definitely worth the visit!Very interesting information about the history of Cusco and the Incas. No need to hire a guide since there are audio guides available (they will give you the code for the wifi and install an app on your phone, you will then receive a code for the app",
          "This amazing stonework was most definitely not done by the Inka! Tour guides always tell you that but the Inka's building style is totally different and they did not have the technology to do this amazing work. This is most probably the work of an older civilization with ties to",

          "I\u2019ve nothing to add to existing reviews except that the price went up to 15 soles. It is certainly worth that. It\u2019s frustrating that this isn\u2019t included on the tourist ticket, even though the associated museum is.",
          "I pay 15 soles as 5 USD to get in this place, this is very nice, you find original Inca ruins, they are under a huge convent but they looks as someone made it a year ago, this is very famous as the sun temple, you find local guides at the gate, you must take some of those if you",
          "The Qorikancha Temple (Temple of the Sun) was ground zero, the most important temple in the Inca Empire. It was originally named Intikancha or Intiwasi and dedicated to worshiping Inti the Sun God. The walls were covered in sheets of gold and golden statues adorned the niches.",

          "This museum has two levels with many rooms, some showing tableaus old furniture ancient paintings a lot of Catholic history and quite a bit of information about the Incas. There are also beautiful gardens and lots of stairs so be sure you can go up and down stairs easily. Wear",

          "Museum costs 8 soles for students or 15 for adults, so not expensive. There are guides outside you can hire, but you\u2019d be fine without as the brochure and signs are informative enough. You can see both the Inca construction and the Colonial structures which is an interesting",
          "When we first entered we were looking at \"another\" church however we soon realised the significance of the Incan component of this site. It was quite amazing and very well presented. Download the app on your phone as it was excellent. A must see if you are in Cusco - we spent 3",
          "If you have already visited Machu Picchu then some of the information that the guides inside will provide you, if you had a guide in Machu Picchu, you will already know or have heard. It is very crowded at key points. I do not think there is any time when the push of crowds will",

          "We spent some time visiting this place and we were impressed by the history and work the Inca people done here.",
          "Interesting combination of Inca and Spanish history. The convent is an excellent example of Spanish colonial architecture Contained within the convent are the remains of Inca temples, you can only marvel at the construction techniques of the Incas, incredible workmanship. There",

          "This was my favorite stop during our trip (minus MP of course). I loved ... well, not love, but you know... how the two cultures look together. I love how they kept the Inca walls inside and it's big. The restrooms are clean (bring money) and the grounds are beautiful. This is a",
          "This museum is well laid out and informative with English translations. A great place to appreciate the Inca architecture and understand how the Spanish destroyed it! We didn\u2019t hire the services of a guide but overheard parts of others\u2019 tours which sounded very interesting!",
          "This place shows both catholic beauty and masterfull inka engineering and architecture. It has an interesting library on the first floor, anyone can go there. A must visit!",
          "Was a very informative narration of each room you visited. Being a photographer was a little disappointed in some areas where it was prohibited. They also had a nice local contemporary art display.",
          "I wandered around this temple a few days before I left Cusco. After I returned to the states, I watched an amazing PBS special (you can google and find the links to the cities of the sky/Native America) that highlighted Quoricancha/Convento de Santo Domingo. Next time I return,",
          "Touring this site with a local guide, well-versed in Inca history made this place come alive. I appreciated the different perspectives of the Spaniards and the native people.",
          "What a treat to see the mix of Inca architecture with colonialism, and the Inca walls win out. The precision which the stones were cut have last many earthquakes and they are still standing....well done.",
          "Our hotel recommended this as the one place we had to see! The gardens are really beautiful with lots of architecture and paintings to see. You can get a local guide from outside for a nominal cost.",
          "Was the first thing that was recommended to us per our concierge to visit. Cool outside aesthetic (especially in the evening), it was a good place to spend a few hours on our first day. Though I wouldn\u2019t recommend going out of your way, it is luckily an easy walk from the plaza",
          "Well preserved church (and the ruins it is built on)...shows respect to both. Grounds and buildings are best spot in Cusco that we found. Enjoyed the art gallery on the second floor.",
          "I did really enjoy it but more for the history of the site\u2019s original purpose and the conquistadors\u2019 bastardization of that than for what you can actually see. Nevertheless, you can still see some elements of it\u2019s early grandeur and some beautiful later ceilings. It\u2019s annoying",
          "I already knew that this was separate from the actual Qorikancha but I imagine many people get a shock. I normally read every piece of information in a museum but skipped things here. There were some interesting points and it was a so-so use of my time given that I wasn\u2019t paying",

          "Highly recommend visiting this site. Best to get the knowledge of a local guide who will probably catch you at the door. Don\u2019t feel pressurised but accept the offer as there is no way you get the true understanding of what you\u2019re seeing without a guided tour. Should cost no",
          "This site has both Qorikancha, the richest Incan temple, and the church and convent that was built on top of it. Qorikancha is deserving of its separate description, and a must see. The church is worthwhile too, with exhibits and a lovely garden.",
          "The remains of Qorikancha show the incredible skill the Incas had in building. The stones are shaped with extreme precision. Some disassembled stones show that they were not just placed on top of one other, but fitted together like 3-D jigsaw puzzles. It's a shame that so much",
          "This was an Inca temple with gold coated walls and solid gold statutes, which are left to your imagination because the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro stripped most of its gold. What you see is the remains of the temple and the conversion to a religious convent by the",
          "Everything is better with a guide. Wonderful visit. Fulfilling. So much to learn of the syncretism of local people and Spaniards.",
          "This place is a must see to learn about the planning and engineering that took place to put the massive stones together without any \"modern\" tools. Our tour guide was very informative and pointed out several,things that we would not have know or heard about. I would not only",
          "Qorikancha was the very first stop on our guided tour of Cusco and the Sacred Valley. We admired it from our hotel across the street and knew that we would explore it, either with our guide or on our own! A guide is very helpful as there are few placards with information. It is",
          "A visit to this temple/monastery is worth it. It\u2019s a blend of cultures and history. We learned a lot and came to appreciated the blending of cultures that is Peru.",

          "Different periods are mixed in this museum. Take a guide, because the explanations make everything so much more interesting. Do not forget to go on the side of the toilets, where you'll find beautiful gardens.",
          "but, Included in the Boleto Turistico pass so popped in for a quick visit. Exhibit is very small and a bit disappointing. Also, easy to miss as it's located underground.",
          "Included with the Boleto Turistico pass and close to our hotel, we decided to visit this very small underground museum situated in the park area below the Qorikancha. There are some ceramics and some skulls. Low lighting and cramped quarters make it difficult to spend much time",
          "The tour is crowded and confusing, with guides and groups sharing the same small places at the same time so almost impossible to hear explanations sometimes. Lack of organization from the door until the end of it. But worth a visit, important historic site.",
          "This place really got our attention. Located right next to Plaza De Armas ( the historic center of Cuzco ) its a place that will most likely take an hour or two of your time. The entrance fee is about 30 soles ( for two people), they have a little souvenir shop. At the gates you",
          "We went here as part of our half day pre booked tour with our operator. Our guide was extremely helpful and told us lots of information about the place pointing out historic artifices and paintings. Had we not had the guide and just walked around the important significant things",
          "Set in an elevated position overlooking the Jardin Sagrado, this museum offers the visit an insight into Inca structural capabilities. The museum shows part of the original temple structure and one is left in awe trying to imagine the complete works and walls gilded in gold.",
          "Nice museo to have a glimpse of the history and how the spaniards destroyed much of the Inca culture and buildings. Its saddens the heart.",
          "A great museum to explore. Allow some time to see everything. Entry fee is about 15.00 Sol for adult ticket. We had a guide to explain the history and it was well worth it.",
          "Everywhere you go in Cuzco you see the Inca presents. Same here. The city really took care of this place and knows the importance of it. Check it out!",
          "This place is so beatyful and interesting. You van not visit Cuzco without visiting this place. There is so much of all Cuzcos historic, you will get to know here. And the building in it self is worth watching. I recommend paying for a guide. Do it!",
          "Before being San Domingo, it was Qorikancha. the biggest Inca Temple. Absolutely worth visiting to see incredible structures of Inca walls and rooms in near perfect condition.",
          "Beautiful building , home to some wonderful art and Inca artefacts BUT what a chaotic mess... paid 15sol to enter so very reasonable but then... there were literally thousands of people.. all clustered in their language groups with guides yelling over the top of each other and",
          "This is a great stop to see very rare Inca intact structures that were unearthed during an earthquake - because all of the Spanish stuff built on top collapsed. A true gem to see in the city.",
          "It has very good painting collection. It was built over an Inca temple, now remnants of the temple including walls are part of the exhibition. It is a must if you are in Cusco.",
          "This is interesting as noted it is both an Inca ruin and a church--so the combination is something to see. But I frankly found many of the other Inca Ruins to be more interesting. This place does get crowded too--and you definitely need a guide to see the place and what it is",
          "Be sure to have a tour guide take you through as the history is incredible. We visited as part of the overall Cusco City Tour which I would highly recommend.",
          "The building is pretty cool, and there is some interesting history, but honestly it wasn\u2019t that interesting. There are a couple rooms with some stones, and a few boards with history, but not much else. The garden in the back had a good view so that was nice. Wouldn\u2019t recommend",
          "This site is interesting enough but we felt it suffered from a bit of an identity crisis in that it doesn't know if it wants to be an Inka ruin or a Spanish colonial church. It is of course both but the two don\u2019t crossover all that well in the presentation. It\u2019s touted as one of",
          "This attraction is about 10 mins away from the Plaza de Armas. It is a very beautiful building both during the day and at night. The museum is interesting to visit to understand the history of the people and culture.",
          "This place is rather unique and special as actually a convent was built around an old Inka temple, which today still partially is visible. The convent itself is yet another sample of Spanish colonial architecture which to us seems so impressive, but is looked-at differently from",

          "I was keen to visit this site however on Sundays they only open at 2pm so getting there at the opening time meant a very large crowd. The ticket line moved fast and once in there is a lot to see. I move toward the back and then upstairs so you can get great views of the",
          "An old monastery built upon an even older Incan ruin makes for a very interesting visit, specially since the incan ruin can be seen from within the monastery, giving the place a very eclectic feel that i have not seen anywhere else.",
          "It gives a bit a strange feeling to see the old inka walls on which the new christian building is constructed. But interesting anyway",
          "This is a must go for history lovers. It was the ancient Inca Temple of Inti, the sun god, an it has impressively preserved structures of the original temple. I recommend you get a guide to walk you through the place since the offered information is not enough in my opinion.",
          "Get a guide to truly appreciate the story and tragedy of this sacred Inca site which still demonstrates the amazing construction skills on the civilisation and a central point of their culture",
          "The church building sits on top of what was once an Inka temple. Truly a shameful reminder how Catholicism destroys cultures and civilization. The surviving Inkan wall of interlocking polygonal rocks illustrates their architectural and mathematical genius. It\u2019s fantastic that",
          "A must see if interested in Cusco\u2019s past. This place does not offer tours (?!) or at least I could not find any. There are, however, people standing by the entrance, who offer tour guide service. We made a mistake not to hire one, there is lots to see. Apparently the convent is",
          "Koricancha is the most impressive example of how Inca and Hispanic cultures fused together. The temple is a symbol of Western dominance. The site is a living example of the co-existence of Peru's past with European architecture. The temple was built with finely carved stones.",
          "Our guide took us to the convent to show us a number of different things. You can see how the Spanish covered the walls prior to an earthquake helping to start the reclamation of true Incan walls. There is also interesting artwork that has subtle details changed to implicate the",
          "I wish someone could tell me who did the contemporary oil paintings in the Choir room above the main chapel here. They were intriguing and were just the cherry on top of what was a very interesting afternoon. I would spring for the extra 10 sole's for a guide. My group of",

          "As part of our half day tour we visited here with 3 children, 10,14&16. Interesting culturally and architecturally , even the 16 year old had questions to Ask especially about the damage done by recent earthquake tremors!",
          "The Spanish tried to wipe out all vestiges of Incan worship when they converted the Incan capital of Cusco into a Spanish town. This included building big churches on top of Incan temples. In this case, it was Qorichancha, or the \"golden palace\" - where supposedly many golden",

          "We were hurried through here on our group tour. I recommend having a private guide who can tell you more than our guide was able to cram in, given our short time there. No picture taking allowed.",
          "I thought it'd be a lot more exciting than it was. The building and gardens are beautiful from the outside but the inside leaves a bit to be desired. The incan walls are super cool but that's about it.",
          "Nice visit in Cusco but not as exceptional as I expected. I recommend you to take a guide to understand everything about this temple.",
          "It\u00b4s a magnificent construction, has green areas and stone constructions all over the place. Without a doubt it will make you travel to the past and appreciate the history, ii will surprise you. Very spectacular!",
          "We had an excellent guide who was born in Cusco and knew the site inside out. This was a fascinating tour of a wonderful building with many Inca treasures - some obvious - the wonderful stonework - and some hidden.The Inti Raymi (Festival of the Sun 21 - 24 June) procession and",
          "We went with kids of 14 and 10 and we all enjoyed the visit. Definitively worth a visit! It was quite crowded even though we arrived within 30 minutes of the opening, but that did not hinder us. There are quite a few number of guides offering their service, but in my opinion",
          "We were so sick of anything related to Spanish conquest of Peru and Catholicism by the time we got here that we almost skipped this gem of a city within a city. A guided tour is highly recommended. We learned all about how much it would have royally sucked to be a nun here in",
          "One of the most important stops in Cusco - beautiful place with tons of history. We visited here as part of a city tour and really enjoyed it. Amazing examples of the architectural perfection the Inca were able to achieve. Wish we could've spent time in the gardens - they were",

          "The actual Qorikancha site was absolutely one of our favorite museums. We hired a guide on the day of the summer solstice (june 21) and learned all about their calendar system, their belief and importance on the stars, and had a fantastic tour with a local professor. Highly",
          "Entrance is included in cusco boleto turistico. But it's kind of a scam as you only get access to a small dark deteriorated museum with few pieces of old in a stuff. And very confusing and poorly written explanations ( both in Spanish and english). The scaled designs of the",

          "Visited as part of a day tour of Cuzco and was impressed. Great example of a church built over the ruins of an Inca temple. Having a guide is recommended to get the history. Inca temples retained within the church gives an interesting history. Recommend a visit whilst in Cusco.",
          "Pay for a guide, we didn\u2019t and just walked through ourselves and missed a good portion of the history. Even without a guide, the place was amazing. The church paintings and items were wonderful to see. Added with an outside area to walk through made the 2 hours worthwhile.",

          "Qorikancha is a special place in Cusco history, and a tour gives you both the insight and the experience of seeing how cultures clashed, since the Catholic Spaniards built a church right in the ruins of the Quechua temple site. My family found it a very moving history lesson,",
          "If you're going to be in Cuzco don't miss this place. I was in the city once and never saw it as I was preoccupied however on my second trip here I visited. Its amazing to see the walls of the temple still there. This was once the most important temple in the entire Inca",
          "Having completed the Inca trail, we'd learned a little history before visiting Qorikancha, which made it all that more interesting. Really enjoyed the artwork - particularly the Cartagena piece showing Qorikancha at the heart of Inca Empire with lines extending outwards, each",
          "This convent incorporated the Inca temple and ruins into there cathedral . So you see quite a bit of the Inca history and how they lived and used Astronomy. Highly recommended to take a tour guide that can show you the how Cusco is known as the Naval ( belly button ) of the Inca",
          "I arrived the first time with the city tour which consisted a good explanation about the place. The place itself is beautiful from the inside and outside and sometimes there are activities outside on the garden of the temple",
          "This is a must see place in Cusco. The mix of Inka and Spanish and the history behind this site are impressing. A guide will tell you so many things you would otherwise miss. Take a tour of this one.",
          "Located quite close to the main plaza . This Spanish Domingo is built on the foundation of the most important temple of the Inkas . One can see the different material use by the two different culture . Interesting visit .\u2019",
          "Definitely get a guide. There is so much to see here - a mix of Incan and Spanish conquistadors. One of the few Incan structures still in place in Cusco.",
          "Very large cathedral in the central square of Cusco. Ornate with multiple sections. No photographs allowed and only a small gift area so it is difficult to have memories. Guide is helpful.",
          "From the outside it's interesting to see the Inca-Spanish combination in the construction. Also similar combinations in other buildings in the area. We didn't pay the 15 Sol to go inside Santo Domingo. One can appreciate it from the outside and save money",
          "The Qoricancha in Cuzco is the major historical place in the town. Here is the Inca's main temple, which was robbed, destroyed, and then use as the foundation for the Catholic cathedral. Beautiful garden, and the Inca's stones",
          "Qoricancha ceramics museum is not too large, has interesting ceramics, skulls and mummies. No needs in guide, we spent 1 hour and that was enough, no lines. Located near the Qoricancha Temple",
          "You can easily spend an hour or two here with so much history it's hard not to get lost into the exhibits. This site is separate from the boleto turistico but we'll worth the few soles per person it takes to get in.",
          "Loved this place - so much history!! It was worth it to pay for a guide, if not you missed so many of the details.",
          "We did not know what the museum was about. We thought there is something outside, bu then they said that is just outside. There is nothing to see here. Save your time. It is included in the Boleto Touristico, but waste of your time.",
          "What a great place to visit. Enjoyed it more than the cathedral. The pillars, artwork, gold coated walls and pure gold statues and the history is so interesting. The tombs of the first two Peruvian saints, Santa Rosa de Lima and San Mart\u00edn de Porres. Tour guides in the front",
          "Worst museum we've been to in a long time. Don't get it confused with the the actual museum on the actual site nearby which is definately worth seeing. The displays were ancient and look like they were created and translated by school children. Don't take my word for it, look",
          "this was really cool. the area has an underground museum that opens up into this grass area.quite a different experience. but don't be concerned because even though you go down into the museum part, it is quite open and easy accessed so don't be scared in any way. I did not go",
          "I actually liked this Convento more than the Cathedral and other shrines in Cusco. This is the place where there was an important Inca temple and on top of it there is now a Spanish Convent. There is a small admission fee to get in, well worth it. You walk in and you can",
          "Probably the most interesting about it is that it is a church built on the base of an Inca's temple. Above that not specifically impressive.",
          "Absolutely a must see while in Cusco. Take 2 hours to stroll or on a tour for the full history and stories behind the scenes.",
          "Spaniards didn't leave much after conquest but some walls of the Inka temple survived showing high precision of stone masonry design for earthquakes. very impressive workmanship includes water piping connections made from stone",
          "Best visited as a guided tour because there is lot of background and history about Cusco to be learnt. This is a must see of course.",
          "This little museum is the repository of some of the artifacts from the Qoricancha Temple which is very nearby. It didn't take long to visit and some of the displays were quite interesting. It was included as part of our Boleto Turistico del Cusco. We were inside no longer than a",
          "Well mostly, some has been added to since but a fascinating look at an original Inca temple and how it\u2019s planned and laid out. A must see in this land of the Incas.",
          "This is very busy although the chapel is open to the public. You need to buy ticket before entering and the local weekly ticket is not part of the deal",
          "The artwork is wonderful. The almost fully intact inca temple located inside the boundaries of the property is quite amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Hire a guide in order to understand what you are looking at. We learned a lot!",
          "nice church, it has free entries. the view from outside is nice, it has great garden. gets busy with tourist.",
          "The museum consists, in fact, of two separate parts, with two separate entrances. One part is ruins of Inca Temple and a church built on top of it. Many photos of this part are on TA site. A great place to visit with or without an excursion. The guides in front are expensive.",
          "Glad we visited but probably woudlhht have if it hadnt just been part of our tour. It was good to see the original set out for Incan life and culture and to hear the stories alongside it all. Definitely needs a tour or audio or you lose some of the significance.",
          "Structure is imposing but its history is the most significant. Little bit of a stroll from the center unless you take the pedestrian passage which we discovered later. Lots of tour groups to follow around. Tip: Use your student ID and don't confuse the catacomb museum",
          "Worth a visit to see the results of another Incan Temple destroyed by the Spainish. Some of the original Temple stones remain. Photos are not permitted inside due to the old paintings, but you are free to photograph the building and it\u2019s beautiful courtyard. A guide is a must,",
          "Located centrally in Cusco and well worth a visit. Glad we made the effort. The Inca foundations/remains are substantial and were incorporated into the Spanish Cathedral. As with other structures, those built by the Incas survive the earthquakes whereas the Spanish efforts are",
          "Visited this site with our tour group. Our tour guide provided by Condor Travel was very informative and gave us all the historical information regarding this particular site. Shame of how people were back then by destroying beautiful sites, which of course they didn\u2019t consider",
          "Very nice, this is the last and the best place visited in case you hide the archeological Cusco tour, very interest, full of history, really worthy!",
          "After the 1960 earthquake, the Inca temples upon which the church was built was given preference in the reconstruction. This was the center of the ancient capital from which the invisible 'ley lines' radiated out across the Inca empire connecting all the sacred stones,",
          "Yet again the Spanish destroyed an Inca Temple to build a church to prove \"my religion is better than your religion\". This temple was the centre of the Incan world and a temple to the sun. The only parts of the temple remaining are foundations to the church, which has been",
          "Qorikancha, located in Cusco, provides the tourist with a good understanding of how things transitioned in the Columbian era. though the main part of the original Inca structures were destroyed by the Spaniards, they kept many of the original Inca walls, incorporating them into",
          "What remains of the old Inca part of this church is interesting and has a lot of history. To appreciate this place, a guide is a must. Someone who can explain all of the little details makes it come alive. Photos are restricted regarding the paintings but not the rest of the",
          "Authentic Peruvian food and entertainment. Upstairs from a beautiful courtyard and away from the street hustle. Fresh and perfectly prepared.",
          "We visited so many sites in Cusco that it's hard to keep them all straight. Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and layer your clothes because it's quite warm when you're in the sunshine and it chills down very quickly and is quite cold at night. So please plan ahead when",
          "This was our first stop on our walk to the old city centre. We enjoyed the church built atop an old inca temple and the history around it. It also gave some pretty views of the city.",
          "The beautiful gardens and curved foundation walls are a sight to behold. I'm glad the Spanish invaders didn't destroy the garden or the foundations. Inside the 'church' are remnants of the old temple...absolutely stunning. Ancient history hidden among the original foundations",
          "To see the combination of the 2 cultures is amazing, Inca and Spanish combined is awesome, great walking tour!!!",
          "This temple as many other Inka constructions was distroyed by Catholic invaders. Nevertheless it's a great historic place to visit with a good Guide.",
          "This is the center of the Incan empire. You should schedule 2 hours to look through this building. Go slow, contemplate, have a tour guide or download a description.",
          "Qorikancha covers some Inca history and showcases the engineering feats of the Inca's. The church is beautiful, with amazing paints and arches. Its great trip for a couple of hours.",
          "Qorikancha is the main Inca temple and Spanish built cathedral on top of it. So it has nice mixed architecture, original Inca walls including interesting circular walls made of big stones without using mortar. On the other hand the adjacent Qorikancha museum (part of big tourist",
          "We had time to spare on our last day in Cusco and came here as a way to stay out of the rain. What a treat! This is a convent and church (with separate entrance) built over an Incan temple, part museum and part art gallery. You can hire a guide at the entrance but there are",
          "The museum has some interesting pieces to offer, but it could use some more love, especially at the information boards, they look old, dirty and confusing.",
          "15 Soles is too much for the little things it has to offer. Sure the inca temple is awesome and super interesting, but there is not much left of it, that you can see. Most of it can bee seen from outside and the religios paintings didn't do it for me. Save your money.",
          "It is a Catholic but, unlike virtually all other churches in Cusco, they actually preserved the Inca ruins within. That was strictly the focus of our tour but that was OK. It was more interesting than the more modern stuff. Probably the best Inca ruins without having to take a",
          "The gardens around are beautiful, if you are lucky and get a nice day with no rain is good to have a lunch in the garden and enjoy the view.",
          "A beautiful church that contains both Inka and Spanish architecture, with amazing paintings and arches. A must see.",
          "Did this in the morning on our first full day in Cusco. When we went to buy our tickets, there was a Peruvian man outside who told us he was a professor and would give us a personal tour for a fee. We were skeptical but decided what the heck and after negotiating the fee went",
          "a good museum with many things to know and learn about the history, come to this place with the service of the city tour in the city of Cusco.",
          "We came here only because we had paid for the tourist ticket when we visited Sacsayhuaman, and we had some free time. It was underground, and a little hard to find. I took a photo of an empty display case! It desperately needs some funding. In the end it was quite funny and but",
          "It was incredible to see the Incan architecture, religion, history, and art displayed all in one place. It has everything, from a museum, paintings, mini temples, and a wonderful mix of Spanish and Incan architecture!",
          "The interior of Convento de Santo Domingo is amazing with astounding artwork. The exterior is comprised of Spanish colonial architecture and Incan architecture. You can tell the distinct Incan architecture from the Spanish architecture.",
          "I would\u2019ve liked to have spent more time here but alas we were on a tight schedule. This is the fourth church built on this site. Earthquakes in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries destroyed the previous ones. I know it\u2019s \u2018just another church\u2019 but there was something magical",
          "This museum was described as the mummie museum to us, and they do have a couple Inca mummies. Its a small museum, and if you do not have a lot of time I would recommend going to the Museum of regional history instead.",
          "This cathedral was built upon the ruins and founations of an Inca temple. We visited as part of a city tour and having a guide was definitely worthwhile. A beautiful place with a lot of history, but you need a guide as there is very limited signage.",
          "We visited this site as part of a Cusco city tour. Very interesting history and ruins, exemplifying the precision of Inca architecture. Make sure you have a guide or at least an audio-tour to get the most of the explanation of each building, their significance, and even details",
          "Great example of Incan construction, history, art, and religious history. We took a brief tour and are so happy that we did. You can often find tour guides outside waiting for customers. If they are official tour guides, go with them. They are highly educated and can provide you",
          "This site is one of the \"must\" sites, if you want to understand more about the Inca. I wish there would be more written explanations in English, next to every point of interest.",
          "This sight was wonderful. This was the location of the Inca Temple of the Sun. It is basically a Spanish church built on an Inca temple. Remnants of the Inca structures can be seen. There is a rose garden out back. The bathrooms are clean. Admission is cheap.",
          "Worth the time to stop here on your tour. The gardens are lovely on the outside and so interesting on the inside. We went on a guided tour and glad we did!",
          "There are a lot of tour groups that venture into this beautiful place. Our tour guide was extremely informative and had a wealth of knowledge for both the Incan ruins as well as the Christian component to this sacred place. I highly recommend this place as it is easy to get to",
          "The guide was wonderful showing us the old Inca Temple of the Sun now a Christian convent. The Incan stone work was simply amazing. The knowledge the Inca's had of the perfect location for the temple to catch the sun at there perfect moment, amazing.",
          "Also part of the cusco city tour Highly recommend having a guide to take you through Our Guide was very good and we actually spent almost 45 mins in here going through the history Great visit and must do in cusco U can see the Incan building design as the base of this",
          "The header says most of it. Informational signs are excellent and gives a good background on the Inca site. The religious art is also interesting and gives comprehensive info on the symbols and meaning in the paintings.",
          "Cusco was the \u201cVatican\u201d of the Inca Empire and Qorikancha was the crown jewel, the holiest of holies equivalent to the Sistine Chapel. It is essential to visit all the important Inca sites with a knowledgeable guide to learn the cultural significance of the buildings. Even a",
          "Very interesting, we stopped here as part of our tour with Vantage and enjoyed the Convent & the incan ruins that this convent was built on top of .",
          "One of the highlights of our stay in Cusco! We were so happy we had a very well informed guide to explain the significance of what we were seeing. The Inca people built the temple with extraordinary precision, each rock smoothed and fashioned to fit for a perfect, smooth",
          "A must-see when visiting Cusco. This place is beautiful and full of history. I loved the gardens and the Iglesia de Santo Domingo.",
          "We went on a Sunday afternoon...bad move. The place was infested with tour groups and pushy tour guides that had no concept that other people might want to look at the place. Avoid the tour groups if you can.",
          "The tour of the convent was interesting, especially the Incan ruins that the convent is built upon. The view looking of the city at sunset was very pretty.",
          "This is a large site with plenty to see. Consider getting a guide to help bring it to life for you. It has a pretty convent, a museum and nice views.",
          "You can really tell the original Inka stone work and what the colonials added on afterwards. Gardens are pretty",
          "If you are interested about Inca history, you will know what happened almost 500 years ago at this place. Originally named Intikancha for reverence to Inti (God of sun), it is located at the old Inca capital of Cusco. Destroyed around the 16th century war by the so-called",
          "This place was originally the Sun Temple for the INCAS. Then, the Spanish built a church on top of it. You can still see par tof the old temple. It's simply amazing how they built all buildings. Definitely worth to visit",
          "The museum is small and has some English translations. The day we went there seem to be an issue with the plumbing. No wows or compelling reasons to make a dedicated trip. Sad to say.",
          "You run out of adjectives, awesome place. Nice displays, Still a functioning church, nice grounds. Spanish and Inca-",
          "Interesting Architectural / culture of spanish assimilation of locals, Nice details inside of former palace. Peru is still in transition, We spoke with many Quecha and native pride is bounding. Ex. Many streets now have a spanish name and an indigenous name.",
          "The overlay of the catholic church on top of the Incan site as it was revealed by a prior earthquake was rather interesting, and the wall with the milky way mural was particularly enlightening...still better with a guide, though!",
          "Whilst Machu Picchu is a brilliant outdoor exhibit of a town, Qorikancha shows the same under cover. Now integrated into the Dominican church the spectacularly artful Incan stone cutting is visible both as internal walls & the external terracing fronting a large parkland. There",
          "What a surprise to find this cathedral just across the road from my hotel and to see the incredible blend of Inca stone carved from Basalt in the style with no mortar and great joints with the Spanish and Moorish architecture built above. The church was originally a sacred",
          "Unique place, full of a mystique energy. My recommendation is to visit it at noon, the sounds and the light will play with your mind!",
          "Do not miss this Cusco historic attraction on your visit. It's beautiful and well-worth your time for its relaxing educational value and splendid exhibits.",
          "Beautiful setup and lots of history will reveal itself visiting this beautiful site. One of the must-do things while in Cusco. Respite from the busy downtown and a lovely learning experience with very nice expositions.",
          "After seeing so many enthusiastic reviews I was a bit disappointed with the place. Of course it is important for its history and is just beautiful inside and outside, but it is rather a short visit. I paid 8 soles for the entrance (student discount) plus 25soles for a private",
          "I wish we had paid for a guide to better explain the history of the Inca sun temple. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating place.",
          "Built as many other structures by the Spaniards on the foundation of the Inca structure that was destroyed by the spaniards, this place has lots of history.It was just up the street from our hotel on the way to the main square...we could have easily spent the whole morning at",
          "We see a big difference in Inka stone layering techniques vs the Convent sanctuary which choose to take the Inka stones to build.",
          "Right in the middle of town and very easy to get to. Tickets cost 15 soles and aren't included in the general pass. Queues were long and lots of tour groups. This is a Catholic Church built over and around some Incan structures. All in very good condition and worth a visit.",
          "We went here as part of our City Tour of Cusco, interesting temple with lots of history, this place used to be covered in golds. Lots of good paintings. Well worth the visit.",
          "Located in Cusco and originally built by Incas as the House of the Sun (Coricancha) or temple in honor of Inti. It is said plates of gold adorned the walls and the masks and jewelry on Seven deceased Incas (rulers). Like the cathedral, the Spanish built over the Coricancha",
          "The place is full of history and you can see the Inca structures as well as the Spanish Convent that was build on top of it. It is part of Cusco\u00b4s UNESCO world heritage, definitely worth a visit!",
          "Across the street from our hotel, this monestery-Inca temple sits on 10 acres. There is a fantastic modern art museum on the top level - the workers there were so bored, we saw one of them bring a taser in, and amused ourselves as they \"zapped\" each other and ran from room to",
          "We initially thought it a large church and were confused when the national policeman told us it was a temple when we asked. You have to enter the cloister to see the Inca temple hidden inside. Expansive site offers the opportunity to admire both the temple and the church",
          "We visited the Convent after returning to Cusco from Machu Picchu. The old Spanish exterior of the Convent is beautiful and so is the courtyard. The green garden area also looks amazing in the sunshine. There are a nice collection of paintings and history about the Incan",
          "We visited this place as it was included in our packaged ticket for Cusco ruins (the Boleto Turistico Del Cusco is130 soles for 7 days), but I found the museum could be better curated, and we could have better spent our time visiting other ruins.",
          "Remarkable stonework and significant history in this amazing place. Felt much more formal than many other sites, but in line with its importance.",
          "The entrance fee is 15 soles just over \u00a33 ( $4.50US) on the lower level you have Inca walls and convent courtyards upper level art gallery",
          "This place is a Dominican church built on top of and around several Quechan temples. It's interesting to compare the precise structure of the \"barbarian\" Quechan walls with the ugly rock and mortar construction by the \"superior\" Europeans.",
          "There is an entry fee associeated with this, its about 10sol. Do recomend to visit during the night it is nicelly iluminated",
          "The convent was purposely built on top of holy Incan ground, once all the gold was conveniently removed. The tour does not shy away from this history, and is well worth the time to see the original Incan structure that the convent built over but has since been recovered. While",
          "Catholics will enjoy this very much and anyone interested in the history of the area. Some pre-Columbian relics remain.",
          "I came with a group tour pretty fresh off of my overnight flight, so admittedly I may not have been in the best frame of mind to tour any building. Our guide did point out the interesting Incan walls that are still standing inside of the church and gave us some history about",
          "This place is amazing, mainly due to the massive stonework below. It's impressive how precise and extensively these stones were worked and adjusted together.",
          "Takes some imagination to work out the five temples on this site. However it was interesting to see the little that was not destroyed like the cornerstone which helped the structure together.",
          "It was the place where we learned how the old relegation was integrated into the new and how, in some subjects, the Quetchua (headed by Inka) were scientifically evolved. Undoubtedly worth a visit.",
          "This was absolutely amazing and interesting place to visit. We especially liked the paintings and sculptures . The way it was built to escape earthquake damage was also interesting",
          "I came here as part of a tour that saw multiple sites. Having a tour guide explain the history of the structures made the visit much better, but this is definitely a stop you can skip. We had a very short visit and this is NOT a place I would recommend by itself.",
          "Once covered in dazzling gold, if Cusco was the navel of the Inca Empire, this temple was the center of the navel. All the temples honored different facets of the cosmos including the sun and moon with beautifully accurate windows and alcoves. The center of the courtyard, is the",
          "Is only 15 soles, so is worth the visit. just 2 blocks from Plaza de Armas. Get a tour guide. He or she can make you get the best of the tour. Take a camera to take pictures of the garden.",
          "We visited here as part of our city tour. The church was built over the Inca Sun Temple. The history was very interesting about how the Incas used to sacrifice a young girl to the Sun God asking for the sun to return at the winter solstice. Our guide explained the history very",
          "Beautiful attraction with lots of history to be gleaned from it. Overwhelming European influence so do not expect (for lack of a better word) authentic illustrations of Peruvian culture or style. It is very much so an exhibition of European style.",
          "Visited as part of the Cusco city tour, I felt a bit sad while inside. You can see that it is a mixture of Inca ruins on top of which the Spanish conquistadors built a religious edifice. At every corner you can see the destruction they brought upon South America. Beautiful but",
          "I was a bit unsure of the visit, fearing the religious Spanish overlay of the Inca past would be a bit underwhelming,. But it was excellent, there are some magnificent ruins inside, a couple of which are breathtaking.",
          "Taken with a guide it was fascinating to learn this church is constructed upon Inca ruins. There are man th preserved ruins which have survived earthquake and show the knowledge of the natives in being abld to build to conditions. You will not fully appreciate the place without",
          "Our wonderful guide from 'Alpaca' took us through this historic place. Lots to look at but we wouldn't have enjoyed the visit nearly so much without a guide explaining things to us & telling us lots of stories!",
          "I didn't realize this was such a hot spot. I was just wandering and saw the crowds in front. Naturally i was curious. 15soles to enter, you're immersed with some incredible history, art and religious artifacts. Also has a beautiful square. I ended up surrounded by many",
          "We were on a tour of Peru, and the best way to see this Cathedral is with a tour guide that knows Inca history. He explained how this Colonial city built in the17th century atop existing Inca foundations,creating one of a kind architecture. and how the Cathedral, the Santo",
          "This is an interesting building. Originally build as an Inca temple it was later turned into a Catholic Church which utilised some of the existing architecture. It was really interesting to see how the two different architectural styles exist in the same building",
          "Great place for discover the mix between spanish and Inca people. I really like this place. It can be done within the city tour. I recommend.",
          "Fascinating history touring the Convento de Santo Domingo and the Templo del Sol. Of particular interest was the Inca architecture.",
          "Maybe I liked it more because I could take pictures. This is the place where Spanish and Incan cultures cane together as the Spanish brought stones from the mountains above after destroying the Inca city. They built temples here to woo the locals into converting. Beautiful,",
          "Visit this attraction not for the convent but for the Incan treasures inside. The edifice entrance fee does not cover a tour and therefore you are left on your own to understand, interpret and decide whether you like the museum exhibits inside. In our case, we read in advance so",

          "This museum is the very center of the Inca empire. It houses the Temple of the Sun, which is considered the most sacred site of the Incas. Our private guide was absolutely invaluable in explaining the significance of this place. The museum has displays of the masonry used by the",

          "We went with a guided tour and our guide was fabulous which made a huge difference here in particular. We saw very little signage, which would make a self-guided tour difficult. The site is an excellent location to see original inca/pre-inca stonework contrasted with the",
          "If you love history and admire historic churches with 16th and 17th century European and Peruvian architecture, then put this on your list of places to check out while in Cusco",
          "The Inca ruins are nothing spectacular here. The church is quite nice. There's a bit of information at the start to set the scene, and some art exhibitions upstairs",
          "This site was included in one of the attractions of the city guided tour. Most of the tour operators will have this on their itinerary. Although the museum may be elaborate with some well preserved artifacts, the crowd and the lack of proper guidance makes visiting this place",
          "Oorikancha (Koricancha) the Temple of the Sun was one of the holiest sites in Peru. It was destroyed by the Spanish in the 1530\u2019s. The convent of Santo Domingo was built on its ruins. There are a lot of interesting things to see in both the convent and the surrounding grounds.",
          "We initially went the the museum with our tourist pass and decided to go in after. We opted against having a tour guide and wandered around. It might have been interesting to have a tour guide to understand further the history of this building. It had lovely artifacts on display",
          "Provides some good insight into Inca culture and later colonial Spanish culture in Peru. There's some very good information about Incan Pantheon and how they structured their empire that you will definitely keep in mind while visiting other places.",

          "I was so underwhelmed. I admire the feat of architecture but I can't believe it has so many 5 star reviews. Another brick in thr wall of a super crowded street. Explore every other part of cusco first!",
          "There is no doubt that the Inka were great builders and great engineers. Their construction skills were certainly very well honed and the way in which the stones in their walls were cut to fit together perfectly is quite wonderful. This is regarded as the best example of such",
          "We were walking to a few other places in Cusco and ended up walking down this street. To us it was a kind of cool stone wall but that's about it. Strange to see people taking pictures with it. Maybe would have been more interesting if we did it as part of a tour to learn a",
          "It's pretty cool there are different theories as to what is real about it, what is local lore... I thought it was O.K. I would not go out of my way just to see it though.",
          "Beautiful but probably not worth a special trip. Not much else in the vicinity, and you will probably get enough of a view of it during your other comings and goings around the city.",
          "I did not find this stone any special than others at all. All other stones were very impressive and they were built magnificently. base of the building was very impressive.",
          "It's just a stone.. I mean, it's amazing that the incans build this huge wall of stones, and it does have 12 angles.. Luckily it was on our path, wouldnt go there just for this. Also very crowded, huge line to take a picture.",
          "i am sorry i dont get what all the fus is about & dont dare touch this rock or else !! I guess rocks with 12 sides is super rare and hard to cut. lots of people stop here to take pics. if you touch it be prepared to get yelled at even though it's on an open alley/walkway.",
          "After spending the entire prior day in Machu Picchu, this was a bit overrated for my family and I. We may have enjoyed it more if we went before Machu Picchu.",
          "I don't know enough about stonemasonry or architecture to be overawed by this large stone. It's a very large 12 sided stone, in a big wall built by the incas many years ago. I thought as a whole all their temple walls to be aesthetically pleasing, and this 12 sided stone is no",
          "You'll know when you get there because of the giant crowd gathered in this narrow alley trying to take photos or sell you things. There are tons of other examples of this type of masonry in the same wall, which seem to go unnoticed by most of the tourists. Ok, the 12 Angled",
          "Centrally located, this attraction at first sight appears to be somewhat \"humble\". Once explained it is fascinating to think of the work that went into it. A good photo stop!",
          "Pretty darn underwhelming. I'd walked by it multiple times before someone told me what it was. Yes it's cool but you should go out of your way to see it? Eh.",
          "We stayed 3 blocks from the Twelve Angle Stone it is impressive to see the work of the Incas. Be prepared for a lot of people passing by and many street vendors trying to sell you things.",
          "It was by chance we stumbled about the street where the famous stone is located. I am amazed to see many ppl on this narrow street wanting to take that perfect picture. I am also guilty of such action! Knowing it\u2019s history and how it\u2019s been used now leaves me at a loss for",
          "I find it incredible that a relatively primitive civilisation managed to create stones like this. It isn't very well signposted but there is always a small crowd around it so, once you are on the right street, the location is obvious.",
          "This is a very interesting stone and others used in pre-Inca construction. It is part of the Archbishop's Palace's wall and I would say that, not only this stone but all the stones that make up the walls of this street are very interesting. Literally on this street, one can",
          "Yes the stone has 12 angles. Yes Incas would have taken their most brilliant masons to get this carved/ cut and fit in well (given the lack of tools then). Yes it fits perfectly well into the wall But you will honesty see better examples of Inca architecture all over But given",
          "As the title suggests. Whilst it's impressive when you consider that the Inca's managed to build this hundreds of years ago and we still don't fully understand why, I think going out into the sacred valley to view some of the bigger remains and ruins is more impressive. By all",
          "We were exploring and just happened to go past it. But it's pretty far from the city center, so probably not worth the trek up to see it. But what we did see was pretty spectacular.",
          "this was really interesting. it takes a bit to find it on the wall but is well worth the adventure plus you get to see the mastery of the Inca building of the wall. Absolutely amazing!!!",
          "Waste of time! Nothing special. Many people told me about it like a very special thing to know, but it there is a lot of amazing things to know in Cusco to waste your time looking for this one.",
          "Folks just come and take pictures next to it, and then leave. If you\u2019ve seen other Incan walls, then you can skip this.",
          "A famous stone in one of the historical walls of Cusco, appearing on every travel guide. In Sacsayhuaman you'll be able to see stones with even more than 12 angles though ...Having this said, it still worth the walk through those streets and appreciate the perfect walls made by",
          "If you go to New York City, you need to see the statue of Liberty, if you go to Paris you need to see the Eiffle Tower...if you go to Cusco you need to marvel at the Twelve Angle Stone....and you can even get your photo taken with the 'sapa Inca' dressed in full regalia for a",
          "This one you have to look for but if you find it you feel like you accomplished something. It is on one of the small alleys and it is very easy to walk past as there are walls like this all over old Cusco. We were staying at the Monasterio hotel and this was just a block away.",
          "If you have visited any Inca ruin you will have already been amazed at the perfection achieved in the cutting of the rock faces to achieve dry wall construction with incredibly tight joints. Within the old city along several alleyways remains of Inca walls can be seen, upon",
          "To the untrained eye, this just looks like a stone wall. To those familiar with the area and the building techniques, this is an example of the extraordinary stone masonry and architectural design engaged in by Incas.",
          "We love to walk and actually stumbled on this street by accident in the late evening. It was so amazing to see the shapes and sizes and to think of how many years ago this was built we went back the next day in daylight to see it again.",
          "The twelve-angled stone is composed of a formation of diorite rocks and is recognized by its fine finishing and twelve-angled border, an example of perfectionist Incan architecture. The block is categorized as Cultural Heritage of the Nation of Peru and is located in the city of",
          "went here because of the hype and how it's the logo for a type of beer. I didn't spend a lot of time here, approx. 15mins. It was cool seeing the architecture and how resourceful these people were but the place itself isn't a must-do in my opinion",
          "Amazing these craftsmen must have been something really special. With a shortage of tools their ability is far superior to anything you will see to say.",
          "Beats me how with rudimentary tools the incas could make such precise cuts in the stone and that after so many years the wall is stil, stamding.",
          "We spent some time in this area after dinner one night. While walking in the area for all the nearby Shopping, we stopped here after the recommendation by Trip Advisor. The walkways are narrow and it can be crowded . I do wish we had a tour guide or someone was there to tell",
          "This wall is in a high tourist traffic area outside the Plaza de Armas. Worth the few minutes it takes to check it out.",
          "On one of the pedestrian streets radiating out from paza, big ole carved stone, legend has it, it is the keystone to the whole building. At times there will be many tourists lined up to shoot the obligatory photo- other times people walking by ignorant. Often you will find an",
          "With all the hype i was disappointed on this one. Yes it does have 12 angles, yes its precision cutting. And i walked past it 10 times every day i was in Cusco. But its part an an entire wall of the same stuff!! And with so many touts trying to hit you up for photos & money, id",
          "The 12-sided stone is amazing, but so is the rest of this little road. It has one of the most intact Inca walls of all the city.",
          "The stone is very interesting but be on your toes for people offering to help you locate the stone. There are few locals who wait for tourist to get close to the stone then pointing it out. If you acknowledge that you see it/them, they will ask for a tip for their assistance. if",
          "Its hard to imagine how this stone was cut, and integrated in with all the other ones that surround it, flat in the wall!",
          "It's cool to see, though it's literally a stone on the side of a building in an alley. If you didn't know what to look for, you wouldn't find it.",
          "This is a fascinating and impressive wall. The shapes of the stones have this jazzy feel about them and the way they fit together is astounding. Love the way the walls tilt to help withstand earthquakes.",
          "It is amazing to think of the work that went into shaping this stone and all the other Inca stones. You can miss the avenue if you are walking from San Blas to the Plaza de Armes. There's usually a man dressed up in Inca warrior garb wanting to sell you a picture.",
          "Located at the side of the Cathedral, we took time to visit here. Where else would you find a 12 angled stone? It must have taken so long to shape this stone. Well worth a photo and lots to talk about when you get home",
          "The skills of the Inca builders is no better exemplified by the 12 angled stone where all the adjacent stones fit perfectly with no motar holding things together. DO NOT TOUCH the 12 angled stone.",
          "This was an interesting little side trip as we stayed very close by. The workmanship of the stone wall and how this one was made to fit was very neat to see and learn about.",
          "Don't worry about putting this on your schedule, you'll get past the 12-angle stone many, many times while in Cusco. Stop by when it's not crowded and take your pictures.",
          "Interesting stonework, although not any more special that the stonework at Sacsayhuman or Qorikancha. It is a very popular stop for tours, which means they frequently clog up the relatively narrow walkway.",
          "Is free and is right by the Plaza de Armas. You dont need to pay and it has an interesting story. Shops, restaurants and craft sellers are near by.",
          "It is just a stone with 12 angles in a wall....I found several more in cusco and nobody takes pictures of them hahahaha :) Anyways, is steps away the main square, so go and check yourself.",
          "These stones are enormous and all fit together perfectly. I doubt that it could be reproduced today. The 12 sided stone and the entire wall appears to have been fitted together while the granite was \"soft\"???",
          "Wondering why the stonework is so perfectly made? You would think the UFOs descended to Cusco or Euclid gave the Incan masons a golden caliper to create precisely stacked stones. Well one thing is true- it has to be seen to be believed that this wall exists in a quaint and dark",
          "If you stay in the San Blas area you walk by this spot every day. It's very busy as it's an important part of the historic area. Worth it to listen to a guide telling about the shapes to be seen in the ancient stone wall.",
          "There was a man dressed as an Inca king one evening while another man pointed out the twelve angle stone. It shows that the Incas were pretty amazing!",
          "Twelve Angle Stone is an example of the craftsmanship of the Inca stone masons at their very best. The precision to have just two rocks exact is inspiring but to fit one rock with 12 sides touching eleven other rocks with not even a tissue paper gap, is stunning.",
          "Worth seeing, but prepare for a crowd right in front of it, with people of course trying to sell you things when all you want to do is to look at this piece of rock.",
          "The Twelve Angle Stone is part of another amazing Inca wall. I don't know how they created such precision stonework, I don't think anyone does. In the same lane way is a Spanish wall, very poor workmanship compared to the Inca's.",
          "Craftsmanship! You might be fooled by the different size of stones, but it's all done on purpose, the angle of the walls and the interlocking stones. Amazing.",
          "The Twelve angle stone is an archaeological artefact in Cusco and it was part of a stone wall of an Inca palace. We saw it during our tour visit of the city.",
          "Inca wall leans inward with smaller stones as the foundation. The Spanish Wallis straight with medium stones. The Spanish walk has shifted from recent earth quakes, while the inca wall is amazing. Go around the corner to spot the snake and the puma. Nice area to walk",
          "People are super excited about this stone. It is OK but nothing overwhelming. The bishop house and the small alleys behind are much nicer.",
          "The Twelve Angle Stone is definitely worth a visit if you are in Cusco. It is / was part of a stone wall of a Inka Palace. Nothing super special but part of the Inka history.",
          "This stone is about 2 blocks north on the side street of the Cathedral. You get there and see an amazing collection of stones, but this one is known all over the world.",
          "It is so iconic of Cusco, no problem finding it, just look for the crowd, the problem is getting a photo without people in the way! Not worth going out of your way to see but if you are passing do stop in and take in the amazing workmanship!!!",
          "Our guide kept telling us: you come to Peru with 10 questions, but you'll leave it with 1000! And this is one of the additional questions: how did they do it.... Interesting. You will find it in a nice narrow street, can't be missed because there are always people.",
          "The twelve angle stone is fare away of being a tourist attraction. You will find a guy dressed out as an Inka standing next to a stone and he want you to pay him for takling a picture of a stone, which has nothing to offer... The stone is a stone in a wall, that's it.......!",
          "If you are interested in seeing how the inkas build their walls and the ingenuity involved this is an easy must see in the city centre. Be prepared for the lama women and the inka man charging for photos and for the street to be crowded. Go at 8am and beat the rush if you want a",
          "This is one of the best examples of Inca stonework. On a small street not too far from the Plaza de Armas. Worth a stop and a picture.",
          "The reason for visiting Peru and ancient sites could be to encounter and wonder at these superb monolithic stones and foundations built without Mortar, these stones these stones are FIT to each other and will allow these walls to stand for millenium...",
          "I tried to find it via Google Maps but was unlucky even though Google helped me find everything else. Thankfully a local helped me find it. It's great to see along with other great stone features close by.",
          "This piqued my curiosity enough that I decided to go looking for it just prior to our departure. it is impressive but note that some of the angles are small so you really have to know what you' re looking for and where on the wall. Follow the other tourists or just ask a vendor.",
          "The 12 Angle or Corner Stone is part of the remains of an Inca structure that was built without mortar and using primitive stone, copper and bronze tools. I have no idea how they were able to fit the joints so closely. The wall is certainly worth a look as you walk between San",
          "There are stones from Inca. Nothing spectacular. I think it's a history behind it. The stones are big and right on the street.",
          "Although not easy to find, one cannot help admiring the skill with which this stone was fitted alongside its neighbours.",
          "Must see. Unbelievable as to how it was constructed in the past. You can take pictures and look at it but no touching this magnificent structure",
          "We faith in the human being seeing what people can do with tehy work together with a purpose. Centuries and the stones who spanish don\u00b4t have broken, still remain in this places!",
          "It's a stone that someone has invented a story about! Yes craftsmanship and all that but really?! Go see Machu Picchu... that's impressive, not this stone.",
          "Inca stonework is extraordinary just about everywhere. Much of it reminds me of similar stonework in Egypt. It's not at all clear thousands of years later how they managed to put gigantic stones in a wall (or whathaveyou) and fit them perfectly using no visible mortar. The 12",
          "Every Inca stone in Cuzco is precious however this is a specialty. It is impossible to miss the spot as it is located on a busy street and everyone is pointing the stone as you pass by. The \"legoish\" stone architecture is always fascinating in Inca structure and this is the",
          "The 12 Angle Stone is special. It isn't' \"just a stone.\" It's an important remaining aspect of Inca history and architecture right in the city! Chances are, you'll pass the stone if you take a city tour or go shopping in the San Blas neighborhood. I recommend taking at least a",
          "If you're in Cusco, chances are you'll be nearby, font go out of your way to see it, (in my opinion) there are plenty of original stacked stone walls in Cusco, if you didn't know anything about it, you would easily pass it by without noticing. again, its cool, worth stopping by",
          "Apparently this is special. We walked up and down the street trying to find it. not signed well. Just a stone in a wall of stones",
          "Alot of history behind this stone which you will visit if you do a City Tour of Cusco. We did a quick 2 hour tour which was arranged by our Travel Agency.",
          "Fascinating... maybe. Interesting... possibly. This attraction is one of those that is a more scholarly than touristic. Worth a look but it won't take long!",
          "The twelve angle stone is off of a quaint alley type street with stone walkway. There are multiple souvenir shops along the alley. There may even be a musician playing some music. The stone wall itself is a thing to behold. It glows at night with the overhead lighting.",
          "Definitely a must see if you're traveling Peru appreciating the wonders of the Inka craft and stonework. A little tricky to find but well worth it.",
          "You only have to walk past this astonishing piece of stone to marvel at the Incans skill and artistry, with minimalist tools to hand. They were an outstandingly talented culture. Thank God the Spaniards did not succeed in destroying everything the Incans had achieved!",
          "This stone, built into the middle of a wall, has such an interesting background and proves the incredible talent the Incas had for engineering. Very easy to find and a quick visit",
          "It is not very hard to find the twelve angle stone because of all the foot traffic around it. Just look for the place where everybody is posing for pictures.",
          "these steps are fallacious and stunning. For going to shop, restaurant, hotel, and anywhere in Cuzco you have to step up and down.",
          "we passed by this street so many times and this stone is just breath taking and the reason why I dont give five stars to this review is that there are so many people along this street trying to sell you thing which we considered too much",
          "Don't miss this amazing pedestrian walk flanked on both sides by this extraordinary Incan architecture.If you join the free walking tour at the Plaza De Armas they will take you there and explain it's magic.",
          "Just a few blocks off Plaza de Armas you can walk by this awesome example of the skill of ancient builders, dressing and setting myriad of stones of differing sizes and shapes. It is amazing to see these huge boulders fit perfectly without the use of modern tools",
          "Yes the specific stone in this long wall has 12 right angles and is easy to miss. The wall is an exemple of Inca masonry .Short walk along a nice cobblestone narrow street. The shops around the area are good to buy Peruvian things. Look for Calle Hatunrumiyoc . If you don't",
          "The title sums it up. Originally I just thought....what's the big deal. But after learning about how it was made and the symbolism etc, I had much renewed respect and understanding. This sits next to a central throughway for pedestrians so you cannot (and should not!) miss it.",
          "It actually is interesting enough, but is pretty touristy with crowds and men in Inka costumes, etc. But none the less it is only a few blocks off Plaza de Armas and is pretty impressive stone work. One night when I was there, an old woman standing by kept yelling \" No Tocar\"",
          "You may ahve heard of it and it's true. Walking diatance from the main square you will find this unique stone, surrounded by tons of tour guides who foor les than $20 can take you to other little pic spots like this one.",
          "Pretty neat walking amongst history where you can compare Spanish against Inca stone work. Great walking tour that covers Inca and colonial periods. If your somewhat fit, the altitude should not be an issue.",
          "It is an amazing little street with these stones along the route. There is an incline to get up and down, but take it slowly and take it in. There are shops along the route who sell some incredible local arts, crafts and clothes etc.",
          "I wouldnt call this an attraction, hardly even a photo stop. Yes, its a large natural stone put into place and was able to stand the test of time. If you dont know what youre looking for, you will walk right past it, We only caught it because there was a crowd of people",
          "Fantastic expression of the Inca architecture, really is admirable, splendidly united the 12 angles with other stones of the wall... Muy muy bueno",
          "Like many have mentioned, it is easy to walk by and not realize you missed an important Inca architecture. My hotel was very close to this site and I asked the hotel concierge why people were taking pictures. I googled information about the stone and walked by the street",
          "I walked by this 12 sided stone for 5 days while I was in Cusco. The very large stone was cut with 12 sides and every stone that surrounded this stone was cut perfect. I do not know how the Inca's did it.",
          "While walking though Cusco we encountered the twelve angle stone. The stone itself is jus t that, a stone, but the walls are quite incredible as they are original Inca and have Spanish Colonial buildings built right on top of them. Quite a combination and excellent example of",
          "These Inca stone walls are dotted about all over central Cusco, some only a couple of rows high but you feel compelled to touch them as they are a perfect fit.",
          "Its like a typical 1-michelen-star attraction: If you happen to pass by its nice to see, and its a great way of seeing how crafty the Incas were, but not really anything extraordinary,",
          "This is a huge block of stone cut with 12 different points to add strength and stability to a building. Peru is highly prone to earthquakes so very clever Inca engineers from hundreds of years ago figured out that this was a good anti-earthquake device. There are many other",
          "Incredible to see how precise the stones are laid. That being said, it is a wall. definitely worth brief stroll by.",
          "These blocks are very beautiful. There is a specif one that has 12 angles but the real thing is to fell the mystical air in the place and think about how they had such a great idea. It\u00b4s an archeological artefact. It\u00b4s located in Cuzco, Peru. The stone itself is part of a stone",
          "In a technology was phenomenal and this rock is a testament to the mind blowing perfection Incans required in architecture however it still just a rock.",
          "I thought this would be mind altering. Though this is a very impressive stone after seeing Machu Pichu and other Inca buildings this was ok. Also, as expected the locals use this as an opportunity to gather around and pester to sell things to you. I recommend if you are in the",
          "In an alley, 1 block from the Plaza de Armas, you can find this famous12-angled stone in the foundation of the old palace of the archbishop of Cusco. Nowadays a museum. Almost always guarded by the Inca himself. He is available for photos with him and the stone. Don't touch the",
          "Amazing what was done by hand eons ago. The quality of work is amazing. It is along a road so easy to see",
          "An interesting stone, but what makes it more interesting is that we found a corner stone nearby that had been damaged by an accident and we could clearly see that the ajoing stones were so perfectly cut on all surfaces, Dont know how they did this",
          "A convenient and centrally located site further demonstrating the skill of the Incas. While you can visit on your own at any time, often there are local \"guides\" there who are more than willing to provide a context for the stonework - tips appreciated, but not essential -",
          "I didn't know about this stone until my husband mentioned it so we decided to check it out on our last day in Cusco. Yes, it is just a stone but you should read up about it before you look for it. More than likely you'll walk pass it numerous times while walking the streets of",
          "It's amazing the inka wall and how the inkas prepare and position the stones to ensure stability, even prepare for earthquakes. We were walking by ourself and for 10 soles a person in front of the stone gave us a full explanation of the wall, we confirmed the story with books",
          "we walk about 3 times by the stone. Each time a lot of people where gethering there, were talking and looking at it. Each time we sad, what the hell are they doing ? So we look it up on the internet and find out it is a stone with 12 corners. From the main square take the",
          "Walk straight from Plaza del Armas past Starbucks and up a small side street. Eventually you will come to the stone in a wall of I can stone's. Its unusual but really there are so many more interesting aspects of Inca architecture and stone work, i am told a Norwegian tourist",
          "Unless this stone was pointed out to you, you'd probably just walk by it. No special signs. Most likely you'll see other tourists taking photos so that's how you'll know where it is without a guide. Interesting fact is that one of the national beer companies of Peru adopted",
          "Need to know about the angles and adjacent stones to fully comprehend what the 12 angle stone is all about. Quite the engineers were the Icas.",
          "Walking the streets of Cusco's historic district, you likely will pass this quietly unsung piece of history. Probably the only way you realize ti's there will be by the people who stop for photos in front of it. A fun thing to see. Free and no reservations needed!",
          "If you are walking by it's interesting, but not worth going out of your way for. There are bigger rocks in more remote locations.",
          "We walked by this the first time without realizing it. I'd highly recommend for families, as kids can treat this as a treasure hunt of sorts. Finding the stone itself means pulling out a map of the narrow alleyways of central Cusco, and perhaps getting lost a time or two.",
          "Peruvians were also taking their tourist photos of the 12 angle stone but not sure if this is because of the Incan history or the depiction of the stone on the popular Cusco-made beer. The wall itself all along is one one amazing artistry with fine masonry work. Very close to",
          "It's a good idea to try and visit these alley when it's quiet. In the late afternoon and evening it is very busy with tourists and street vendors. You will find it hard to see the amazing stone work. It's worth trying to visit first thing in the morning when it's less busy",
          "It's such a treat to wander along this ancient alleys and see the detail created by our ancestors, making walls that last over time. Why this one stone required so many angles only the stone mason knew but it is fascinating. Enjoy the many cafes and craft & gift shops in this",
          "One of the most important thing is do not touch the wall...so as to preserved it. Its an amazing architecture ahow how crever Inka are",
          "Incredibly fitting together--still solid after 500 or more years. Wonderful masonry. Hard to believe it can be worked so ably.",
          "There was almost always lots of people standing near this stone to get their pictures taken. There is also an 'Inka King\" dressed up and ready for photos to be taken with him...for a tip of course. Very interesting the location and angle of the stone.",
          "Amazing structure. Exquisite and in keeping with the perfection of many other Inca structures. Early in the morning there is sometimes a man dressed as an Inca King waiting to take photos with you at the stone. It's a fun thing to do.",
          "I liked this place but many people take pictures with this rock so you will have to wait for a while.",
          "We went here on a City tour we did of Cusco. I highly recommend you do a City tour of Cusco, you learn so much about the history and the culture. Otherwise you will miss so much. This was a very interesting part of the tour.",
          "If this is the first Inca wall you will see, you will be impressed. In our case, we had already seen 13 and 14 angled stones so we got used to the great skills that the Inca people had.",
          "This 12 angle stone in interesting because it shows how the Inca's constructed their buildings; almost earthquake-proof. The stone is guarded by a lady who corrects people who are touching the stone ... :-)",
          "This is a two-minute stop but it's a must see in Cusco. Extremely impressive masonry. How'd they do it?!",
          "A must to examine an amazing ancient architecture feat. Look closely, however, it is easy to pass right by - usually a crowd of people in front of it.",
          "The angles are super....constructed to withstand an earthquake and yet so perfectly constructed with primitive tools? How....some say Aliens...others well...you decide. Opposite the Stones are the Spanish equivalent..lol..definitely man/woman made..no aliens here lol... Just off",
          "Our guide had to show us were it was or we would have missed it. Undoubtedly the way the Incas built their wall was masterful. The whole wall is very impressive and this is the most impressive stone of the lot. But it is a stone. You either appreciate the whole complexity of it,",
          "Thought there was a face in the rock, turns out it is just a rock with 12 angles. Much disappointed ... There is much more to see in Cusco. It is free and you will see it as you are walking. Everyone just takes photos with this one rock, always very busy. Nothing special ...",
          "If you enjoy overcrowded allyways in front of a wall, this is the sight for you! It is a large, well-carved stone is an Incan wall much like the other Incan walls you will see n Peru and Machu Picchu, except here, you have to elbow fellow tourists out of the way to see it. The",
          "Was on a self directed walking trip and found the stone near the plaza in Hatunrumiyoq street. Waited and was able to take a photo without passing foot traffic. The whole wall is spectacular and I can see why this stone is singled out. Worth a detour to see it and it is not far",
          "The 12-angled stone seems to be a major sight in Cusco. It is always full with people, and it seems that everyone wants their photo taken with this stone. Sure, it is nice, but it is the whole of Inca masonry that is nice, not this single stone. The problem with the fact that",
          "La piedra de 12 angulos is cool to see, but it is not mesmerizing. If you are in town and have just a few days, then this is a quick easy historic site to see. There is no lines and no fees to be paid. If you are in town for longer than a few days, I would not waste my time",
          "Visited with family during the night. It is a narrow walkway and the stone is there and people are taking lots of pictures. Not supposed to touch it. Of course had to take a picture.",
          "This is a stone with many angles part of a greater wall with lots of stones and lots of angles. It is on the tourist trail in Cusco. You can't miss it with many people doing selfies and often a man dressed as an inca beside it. It is pretty cool to imagine the work that went",
          "It is near the plaza, also a must-go if you are in Cuzco. You get to see other stones around the corner, that also have history. You can pay a tour guy over there, to explain it to you.",
          "we loved walking around here and just taking in the stone work around the place. can get busy but everyone wants to see it;. good shops around too",
          "Seeing the stone with 12 angles, wedged with such preciseness within the other stones, is really something. It's amazing to think of how incredibly tight, the stones fit together, without mortar! How did they do it? Fascinating! Love the narrow street it's on as well.",
          "nice to see and take a pic but there is so much inca stonework around, it kind of gets lost in the mix. this stone is part of a long wall in a narrow street (alleyway). can't miss it because there is a big guy dressed like an inca warrior standing around waiting to get paid",
          "We found the many examples of Inca work intriguing and this is a fine example of their workmanship and ability to cut and fit rocks with no metal tools.",
          "Yes it's interesting how the stones were cut, yes it's interesting at how they were laid, yes its interesting how they were moved all the way from wherever to Cusco. But it is just another stone in the wall.",
          "This attraction was located on a narrow street. It was an excellent location for an interesting picture. There are many vendors and shops next to this attraction.",
          "Without modern tools or measuring devices.....amazing!! It is on a main walkway to San Blas, just ask those nearby or watch for people staring at a wall.",
          "The workmanship of the Inca masons is in full display with this rock. A good 5 minute explanation from a good guide or a guide book will be sufficient to set you up for further visits and appreciation of Inca structures",
          "Most popular place to take pictures in Cuzco. And the 14 sides? What about \"inside\" and \"outside\"? Wonder how they cut this stone?",
          "This is a popular walking street in Cusco. The stone wall is part of the foundations of a church/museum.",
          "this is very close to the main square in Cusco. it is amazing how they were able to cut stones like this 500 years ago",
          "This street indeed it is very nice and also the amazing stonework on this rock is breathtaking all though being in Cusco is not worth at all, if you can avoid going to Cusco and just directly to Machu Pichu and out of there it is worth the trip, in Cusco the people are with this",
          "This stone is in the downtown shopping area and well worth stopping to look at. The Incas cut the stones to fit each other and used no mortar to build the walls. Amazing engineering.",
          "I enjoyed walking down this street to get several photos of the original inca stonework. The 12 sided stone was quite impressive.",
          "Pretty cool to see this and honestly it is a miracle that the Spanish did not destroy this like all of the other Incan buildings in Cusco. It is worth a visit, but the other ruins around Cusco are much more impressive. Don't pay anyone to take your picture in front of it. Just",
          "The 12 angled stone is just a stone in the middle of the wall, huge one notwithstanding. In and of itself, it is just a stone that is elaborately cut ... but in the bigger context of the remains of a well constructed wall, it does testify to a great heritage in construction.",
          "How the ancient Inca people manage to cut a big rock to fit exactly in the wall. The rock is adjusted in 12 parts... really amazing",
          "The twelve angle stone was right on our way from the Amaru Hostel down to the Plaza de Aramas. It is always easy to spot because either the Inca actor dressed in all his regalia, or young men trying to get a few soles by sharing the details about the rock are right there by it.",
          "A classic example of extreme Inca stonework. It's just there in the small street/ally nearby to the plaza so hard to miss.",
          "Walk by and take your picture here. Done. There is a guy dressed up as an Inka here too, snap his picture too. Easy to find on the way to St Blas shopping area and church. Don't miss out on the Bishops museum inside... Great Cusco art!",
          "I didn't know about this stone when we saw people taking pictures along the wall, until i read about it later in Trip advisor. One thing to keep in mind while visiting this place is pick pockets. This is a crowded street. My daughter last her phone (picked from her coat pocket)",
          "Ok it's a nice example of an Inca wall and there is a stone with 12 angles on it as part of the wall. But I don't understand why endless groups of people want their photo taken with the stone.",
          "This is a mystery, and a place to wonder the technology of inka people. Not even a sheet of paper can penetrate. Very well done. This is located behind the plaza de armas.",
          "Surely worth walking by the wall to see the craftsmanship of the wall. Pretty amazing how perfect it was built.",
          "It was a bit confusing to get there as I had expected something else. Once I located (many people taking pictures by it) it was interesting to see and study it. Not a must see item on your to see/do list but while roaming around the streets of Cusco, to pass by it.",
          "This is a perfect example of Inca ingenuity and craftsmanship. It's worth an up close visit though the street can be very congested.",
          "However, the coolest thing about this stone is that it made us look at every Inca site wall for the rest of our trip (and we saw more than 20 sites including those along the Inca trail) trying to find 1 with more angles. We found 10 and 11 but none others with 12.",
          "This is down a narrow cobblestone street and is free. There are plenty of locals to tell you about the stone for a few dollars. Our \"guide\" was informative and also showed us the puma and snake around the corner - which I had totally forgot about! Make sure you see all 3!",
          "The Twelve angle stone, quite apart from it's cultural significance - symbolising the twelve ancient royal ruling families of the Incan Empire - is a work of fantastical engineering, and part of a wall breathtaking in the methods of its construction. Incan stonework was",
          "This was pointed out to us by our guide. It definitely shows the amazing engineering done by the Incas. The more intricate the cuts equates to more praises to their gods. To see how the stones all fit so tightly together is just mind boggling.",
          "Okay if you are walking up to San Blas look for this stone but I'm not sure I'd make a special trip to see this minor Inka site.",
          "The architecture of this wall was beautiful! Here you could often hear someone playing an instrument (at least at night, most times) and during the day, you would see women holding baby Alpacas for photos and men selling their art that holds the symbolic representations of",
          "The stone is massive and does have twelve angles but how does it warrant an entry on here. There is a man dressed as an Incan Warrior there but he is just trying to make money off the tourists. It is fun to watch people take pics with the wrong stone though.",
          "My guide took me, as part of a walking tour, to visit this rock. I'm not 100 percent sure what all the fuss is about but it certainly generates a lot of interest. Grab your selfie stick and take a look!!",
          "The 12 angle stone is nice and all, but why stop at 12?! Just around the corner (across the street from La Bodega 138) there is a stone with 14 angles :)",
          "This stop may only take you 5 minutes to look at but don't just look with your eyes. Use your heart; take the time to emerge yourself in the history and extraordinary skills of this period. Touch the stone, feel the lines and precision. Imagine each turn and angle. Appreciate",
          "This is a cute thing to stop by to see really quickly. It's easy to find, about a block off from the main square. The stone is really neat to look at, but just as a stop by.",
          "This is very close to the Plaza de Armas. Easy walk. Many vendors on the street, as well as tiendas. There is a collection of shops selling handcrafted items a block away.",
          "It is free to see this unique stone in a wall showcasing Inca architecture. There is usually a man dressed as an Inca who you can take pictures with for a tip! Just don't touch the stone!!",
          "The stone walls are actually a site of historical changes with old wall in the bottom and newer wall on top. It's really interesting if you have someone who knows and can explain it to you. It's also cool to see the aqueducts around it as well as narrow streets with flowers and",
          "Everyone loves seeing this stone, and it is interesting, but it takes about 5 minutes. Dont expect anything more than just a stone in the wall. That being said, it is pretty cool!",
          "If you happen to be walking down this alley and you see the stone, great. If you don't see it in person and just see a picture of it, you've gotten most of the effect. There is more impressive stonework at Sacsaywaman.",
          "Great stone wall with multi-corner very smooth joints. It shows advancements of Inkas. This is in the lane just adjacent to the main cathedral.",
          "If you stay in Cuzco for any length of time you will undoubtedly pass the \"wall\" many times. It never disappoints, as the history leaps out at you despite the hoards of tourists always posing in front, me included. Although discouraged, it is impossible not to run your hand",
          "Amazing if you understand the geometry & engineering behind it. If not, it's just a large stone that attracts crowds. Pretty cool, just not as awe-inducing as some of the other structures we had the pleasure of seeing!",
          "This isn't highlighted on the maps, but holds great significance to locals as symbolic of Incan architecture.",
          "On our trip to Peru, we were finally going to Machu Pichu and we would go there from Cusco. While walking through town, we passed this rock. It's absolutely incedible the Inca's have built a wall in which this rock is fiting precisely. You'll start thinking about \"how did they",
          "he was agape at how it could be done...theonly thing is that they dont permit to caress or kiss the stone as a signal of respect, i would like the people who oversees it will be more open-minded. in conclusion, i liked it very much. recommended.",
          "I am amazed at the ability of hoq they could do this without the modern techniques or no computers...if they molded the stone to have 12 angles...how they did do this?",
          "Some say it is awsome, but the others say is this it? I feel it is absolutely awsome. If you think of the carving skills back in hundreds of years ago, it is just phenomenal. Yes, it is a mid sized stone, but it had a lot more story to tell.",
          "We specifically went looking for this stone because we had heard about it. It was worth the look! It really does have 12 corners! And stones that fit all around it! The Incas were an amazing people! Make sure you find this stone when you visit Cusco!",
          "Large and perfect geometric creation of the ancient Inca in Cuzco to watch. Grande y perfecta creaci\u00f3n geom\u00e9trica de la antig\u00fcedad inca, en la ciudad de cuzco para observar.",
          "I had wandered down this path on the first night in Cusco, marvelling at the Inca stonework that has survived earthquakes, but went back to look at the 12 angle stone. Each piece fits together with the ones beside it, using no mortar, so in a tricky jam like this one, the stone",
          "I would not actually describe this as an attraction, but it is cool to see for anyone who loves stones. The architecture and the two animals are interesting, but you can just walk by and spend a minute or two admiring it.",
          "I visited here with my wife. I had expected it could be difficult to find this stone out of hundreds of stones on the wall. However, there were several local people in front of the stone and they pointed out the stone to us. The shape of this stone was really unique.",
          "It\u00b4s just a block from the main square and close to the beautiful neighborhood of San Blas.. but it\u00b4s nothing outstanding really. . Avoid people pretending to be tour guides from selling you their service",
          "Really is great. Incredible inca s work. You can stay at hotel near here with craftman walls. Very big walls. and nice works. HISTORY !",
          "We passed by this stone on a walking tour from San Blas back down to the Plaza de Armas. We were fortunate to be with a great local guide who gave us some history of this impressive stone wall. The wall containing the 12 sided stone is actually the wall of the archbishop's",
          "The stonework is impressive but the crowds are not. It's basically a mob with people taking pictures and swinging around selfie sticks. You can't really enjoy it or take time to admire the intricate detail because there are so many people. A walk by is probably all you need,",
          "Coming down from San Blas to the main square and there it is. Great craftsmanship, wish knew how to make something like this. While we wouldn't come to Cusco just for this, it's part of a great walk around the old part of town.",
          "This is an interesting detail that might be overlooked if you don't know what to look for. However, it's free, you'll probably pass through it, and it's a nice example of the amazing building techniques of the Incas.",
          "It's is free and original. Not much to see. But if you are taking a walk near it, it is worth checking out.",
          "After doing a little research on these stones, it's incredible to me the intricacy and sheer craftsmanship that went into making them fit together so perfectly. They say you can't even fit a piece of paper between the stones, and that's true. Also, to be able to walk past this",
          "Different from so many attractions, this is a free, passing by, interesting feature of the city to see. Be sure you can't put an ID or credit card between two stones in this wall. They used no cement or mortar of any kind, but still these walls have been there for over 500 years.",
          "It took our local taxi driver quite long time to find this place. obviously, it is fairly trivial to local eyes. and i think they are right. so don't bother to visit it unless you happen to stop by.",
          "The first touch of Incas genius, encourages for the further exploration. Situated in a narrow street, a few steps from the central market. Attention at night - not very safe place!",
          "I read about this stone, and didn't realize we walked past it each day to and from the main plaza to/from San Blas area. Just find the people dressed up for what appeared to be no reason, and that's where the stone is. Took a picture, and checked it off my list. I wouldn't go",
          "The wall itself is interesting because the stones fit together so well and were made with Incan technology available. It is earthquake-resistant and cool to look at, but not much otherwise. This really means nothing unless you have some background. Basically, this area shows",
          "This really means nothing unless you have some background. Basically, this area shows off Incan architecture very well, and this 12-sided stone just stands out because it has so many sides and would have had to be specially carved into that shape. You'll see it because other",

          "The 12-angle stone is pretty much just a stone inside a wall. If you don't know what it is, you really won't even notice it, other than the fact that there is usually a man dressed as an ancient Inca right next to it for most of the day charging for pictures. It has a very",
          "Don't touch the stone or the locals will get cross with you!!! Very cool to see this example of Inca masonry, pretty incredible",
          "My origin is Spanish, from South America, and that's probably why I really see among others, the importance of this \"Stone\", which in fact, is not just that, is more; you have to understand the measurements, the precision and the perfection of it, that constitutes a incredible",
          "yes, we have seen stone masonry of high order in several parts of Peru, but that does not mean we can walk by here without a gasp... it's smooth, flawless and above all, FREE to view. you can't miss it as you walk through to plaza de armas. enjoy...",
          "I agree with other reviews, although the stone is impressive due to its size and workmanship, the overall walls are amazing. The local dude that stands by the stone took us around and showed us the snake and the puma, as he said these two representation are more visible in",
          "One interesting stone among many in a wall on a city block. Worth the walk over, otherwise not on a par with the wealth of more interesting things to do and see in the city",
          "Our guide made a point of insisting that we see this stone, which he seemed to think was a big deal. The wall of which it is a part is, like all Inca walls, amazing, but it is just a rock.",
          "The stone is in the middle of an Incan wall on a pedestrian street that leads to the Plaza de Armas. It is worth seeing for the historical significance and to see the entire, mortarless wall build by the Incas. However, there are a lot of vendors in the area as well as \"tour",
          "The stone itself is a good example of the Inca dexterity in stonemasonry. It is placed in the wall of the archbishop palace (a former Inca palace). If you walk along its perimeter you will see a sign in front of a store with the contours of a snake and a cougar although they are",
          "Honestly the one twelve sided stone is not that big of a deal by itself. You can find many stones in the wall with many angles that seem just as \"amazing\". I think the real angle is the guys who stand there all day \"volunteering\" to take your picture - for a few coins. They",
          "Located quite close to the central square it's only a short walk. But the walk is probably longer than how long you'll spend looking at this stone. It's pretty ingenious, but at the same time will only take up a few minutes of your time!",
          "You cannot miss this stone when walking around Cusco. It is in a narrow alley which links the Cathedral corner of Plaza de Armas, with San Blas district up the hill. It would be easy to miss if it wasn't for the man dressed as an Inca King and some women with baby Llamas just",
          "This particular stone is perhaps the most well known showpiece example of the mastery of stonework that the Incans possessed. It is displayed not only in this one piece, but of course as the whole; how everything else fit around it with such precision. It is best appreciated",
          "During my five months in Cusco I've seen many (Japanese and American) tourists gather around this stone to take pictures of it, which seems odd until you hear the story behind the stone. (Then it seems even odder). You see, this rock has 12 sides, which apparently makes it very",
          "The twelve sided stone in Cusco is certainly overhyped. But it is worth a visit. While you wander the streets of the intriguing city you'll be surprised on how many times you pass it. The stone itself is very interesting and a great example of the regions craftsmanship from",
          "The twelve angled stone is a truly amazing Inca artefact and was used as inspiration for the logo of the omnipresent Cusquena beer. It takes only a minor stroll in the centre of Cusco to reach and admire ... Just ignore the many trinket and painting sellers around you. Small",
          "This stone is hidden back on a dead-end road (at least it is right now due to construction). Be wary of locals telling you information and then expecting money. We saw this happening a lot. The stone itself is very interesting and a great example of craftsmanship from long ago.",
          "The stone and the way it fits perfectly into the wall is amazing. There are other stones in the same wall that were impressive as well. On its own it would have been a great site to see, but with the crowds lining for a picture of it and difficulties finding it, not as",
          "While much is said about the 12-angled stone being an example of Inca ingenuity, the entire wall itself is really the neatest thing to see. Very close to the Plaza de Armas, so worth a few minute stroll to see. Be aware: part of the wall next to the 12-angle stone has started",
          "Definitely an interesting structure of massive stones interlocking to form the lower part of the building, but, you know it's not that big a deal. Maybe I didn't quite get it, but I preferred the version of these interlocking stones at the Santa Domingo church juxtaposed with",
          "The stone itself is ingenious and special, but I have to say that the wall in total is probably the most special: really unique, not to miss whej in Cusco. And it's free ;-)",
          "Have a look at the care of the Incans wall with the twelve sides and then have a look up and look at the sub standard extension from the spanish, the difference is stark. The way that they carved the stones would have taken major kills",

        "wiki": "The Inca Empire (Quechua: Tawantinsuyu, lit. \"The Four Regions\"), also known as the Incan Empire and the Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in the city of Cusco. The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century. Its last stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\nFrom 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods. At its largest, the empire joined Peru, western Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, a large portion of what is today Chile, and the southwesternmost tip of Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia. Its official language was Quechua. Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred Huacas, but the Inca leadership encouraged the sun worship of Inti \u2013 their sun god \u2013 and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama. The Incas considered their king, the Sapa Inca, to be the \"son of the sun.\"The Inca Empire was unusual in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the Old World. Anthropologist Gordon McEwan wrote that:\n The Incas lacked the use of wheeled vehicles. They lacked animals to ride and draft animals that could pull wagons and plows... [They] lacked the knowledge of iron and steel... Above all, they lacked a system of writing... Despite these supposed handicaps, the Incas were still able to construct one of the greatest imperial states in human history.  Notable features of the Inca Empire include its monumental architecture, especially stonework, extensive road network reaching all corners of the empire, finely-woven textiles, use of knotted strings (quipu) for record keeping and communication, agricultural innovations in a difficult environment, and the organization and management fostered or imposed on its people and their labor.\nThe Incan economy has been described in contradictory ways by scholars:\n ... feudal, slave, socialist (here one may choose between socialist paradise or socialist tyranny) \nThe Inca Empire functioned largely without money and without markets. Instead, exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. \"Taxes\" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire. The Inca rulers (who theoretically owned all the means of production) reciprocated by granting access to land and goods and providing food and drink in celebratory feasts for their subjects.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Inca referred to their empire as Tawantinsuyu, \"the four suyu\". In Quechua, tawa is four and -ntin is a suffix naming a group, so that a tawantin is a quartet, a group of four things taken together, in this case the four suyu (\"regions\" or \"provinces\") whose corners met at the capital. The four suyu were: Chinchaysuyu (north), Antisuyu (east; the Amazon jungle), Qullasuyu (south) and Kuntisuyu (west). The name Tawantinsuyu was, therefore, a descriptive term indicating a union of provinces. The Spanish transliterated the name as Tahuatinsuyo or Tahuatinsuyu.\nThe term Inka means \"ruler\" or \"lord\" in Quechua and was used to refer to the ruling class or the ruling family. The Incas were a very small percentage of the total population of the empire, probably numbering only 15,000 to 40,000, but ruling a population of around 10 million people. The Spanish adopted the term (transliterated as Inca in Spanish) as an ethnic term referring to all subjects of the empire rather than simply the ruling class. As such, the name Imperio inca (\"Inca Empire\") referred to the nation that they encountered and subsequently conquered.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antecedents ===\nThe Inca Empire was the last chapter of thousands of years of Andean civilizations. The Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be \"pristine\", that is indigenous and not derivative from other civilizations.The Inca Empire was preceded by two large-scale empires in the Andes: the Tiwanaku (c. 300\u20131100 AD), based around Lake Titicaca and the Wari or Huari (c. 600\u20131100 AD) centered near the city of Ayacucho. The Wari occupied the Cuzco area for about 400 years. Thus, many of the characteristics of the Inca Empire derived from earlier multi-ethnic and expansive Andean cultures.Carl Troll has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allow for the elaboration of the staple food chu\u00f1o. Chu\u00f1o, which can be stored for long periods, is made of potato dried at the freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Such a link between the Inca state and chu\u00f1o may be questioned, as potatoes and other crops such as maize can also be dried with only sunlight. Troll did also argue that llamas, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of llamas and alpacas in Pre-Hispanic America. The link between the Andean biomes of puna and p\u00e1ramo, pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire, he opposed environmental determinism, arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nThe Inca people were a pastoral tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century. Peruvian oral history tells an origin story of three caves. The center cave at Tampu T'uqu (Tambo Tocco) was named Qhapaq T'uqu (\"principal niche\", also spelled Capac Tocco). The other caves were Maras T'uqu (Maras Tocco) and Sutiq T'uqu (Sutic Tocco). Four brothers and four sisters stepped out of the middle cave. They were: Ayar Manco, Ayar Cachi, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) and Ayar Uchu; and Mama Ocllo, Mama Raua, Mama Huaco and Mama Qura (Mama Cora). Out of the side caves came the people who were to be the ancestors of all the Inca clans.\n\nAyar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold. Where this staff landed, the people would live. They traveled for a long time. On the way, Ayar Cachi boasted about his strength and power. His siblings tricked him into returning to the cave to get a sacred llama. When he went into the cave, they trapped him inside to get rid of him.\nAyar Uchu decided to stay on the top of the cave to look over the Inca people. The minute he proclaimed that, he turned to stone. They built a shrine around the stone and it became a sacred object. Ayar Auca grew tired of all this and decided to travel alone. Only Ayar Manco and his four sisters remained.\nFinally, they reached Cusco. The staff sank into the ground. Before they arrived, Mama Ocllo had already borne Ayar Manco a child, Sinchi Roca. The people who were already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a good fighter. When the enemy attacked, she threw her bolas (several stones tied together that spun through the air when thrown) at a soldier (gualla) and killed him instantly. The other people became afraid and ran away.\nAfter that, Ayar Manco became known as Manco C\u00e1pac, the founder of the Inca. It is said that he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When the time came, Manco C\u00e1pac turned to stone like his brothers before him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Cusco ===\n\nUnder the leadership of Manco C\u00e1pac, the Inca formed the small city-state Kingdom of Cusco (Quechua Qusqu', Qosqo). In 1438, they began a far-reaching expansion under the command of Sapa Inca (paramount leader) Pachacuti-Cusi Yupanqui, whose name literally meant \"earth-shaker\". The name of Pachacuti was given to him after he conquered the Tribe of Chancas (modern Apur\u00edmac). During his reign, he and his son Tupac Yupanqui brought much of the modern-day territory of Peru under Inca control.\n\n\n=== Reorganization and formation ===\nPachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into the Tahuantinsuyu, which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). Pachacuti is thought to have built Machu Picchu, either as a family home or summer retreat, although it may have been an agricultural station.Pachacuti sent spies to regions he wanted in his empire and they brought to him reports on political organization, military strength and wealth. He then sent messages to their leaders extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high quality textiles and promising that they would be materially richer as his subjects.\nMost accepted the rule of the Inca as a fait accompli and acquiesced peacefully. Refusal to accept Inca rule resulted in military conquest. Following conquest the local rulers were executed. The ruler's children were brought to Cusco to learn about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate them into the Inca nobility and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire.\n\n\n=== Expansion and consolidation ===\n\nTraditionally the son of the Inca ruler led the army. Pachacuti's son T\u00fapac Inca Yupanqui began conquests to the north in 1463 and continued them as Inca ruler after Pachacuti's death in 1471. T\u00fapac Inca's most important conquest was the Kingdom of Chimor, the Inca's only serious rival for the Peruvian coast. T\u00fapac Inca's empire then stretched north into modern-day Ecuador and Colombia.\nT\u00fapac Inca's son Huayna C\u00e1pac added a small portion of land to the north in modern-day Ecuador. At its height, the Inca Empire included Peru, western and south central Bolivia, southwest Ecuador and a large portion of what is today Chile, north of the Maule River. Traditional historiography claims the advance south halted after the Battle of the Maule where they met determined resistance from the Mapuche. This view is challenged by historian Osvaldo Silva who argues instead that it was the social and political framework of the Mapuche that posed the main difficulty in imposing imperial rule. Silva does accept that the battle of the Maule was a stalemate, but argues the Incas lacked incentives for conquest they had had when fighting more complex societies such as the Chim\u00fa Empire. Silva also disputes the date given by traditional historiography for the battle: the late 15th century during the reign of Topa Inca Yupanqui (1471\u201393). Instead, he places it in 1532 during the Inca Civil War. Nevertheless, Silva agrees on the claim that the bulk of the Incan conquests were made during the late 15th century. At the time of the Incan Civil War an Inca army was, according to Diego de Rosales, subduing a revolt among the Diaguitas of Copiap\u00f3 and Coquimbo.The empire's push into the Amazon Basin near the Chinchipe River was stopped by the Shuar in 1527. The empire extended into corners of Argentina and Colombia. However, most of the southern portion of the Inca empire, the portion denominated as Qullasuyu, was located in the Altiplano.\nThe Inca Empire was an amalgamation of languages, cultures and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour. The following quote describes a method of taxation:\n\nFor as is well known to all, not a single village of the highlands or the plains failed to pay the tribute levied on it by those who were in charge of these matters. There were even provinces where, when the natives alleged that they were unable to pay their tribute, the Inca ordered that each inhabitant should be obliged to turn in every four months a large quill full of live lice, which was the Inca's way of teaching and accustoming them to pay tribute.\n\n\n=== Inca Civil War and Spanish conquest ===\n\nSpanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro and his brothers explored south from what is today Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526. It was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure, and after another expedition in 1529 Pizarro traveled to Spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy. This approval was received as detailed in the following quote: \"In July 1529 the Queen of Spain signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Incas. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in Peru, or New Castile, as the Spanish now called the land.\"When the conquistadors returned to Peru in 1532, a war of succession between the sons of Sapa Inca Huayna Capac, Hu\u00e1scar and Atahualpa, and unrest among newly conquered territories weakened the empire. Perhaps more importantly, smallpox, influenza, typhus and measles had spread from Central America.\nThe forces led by Pizarro consisted of 168 men, one cannon, and 27 horses. Conquistadors ported lances, arquebuses, steel armor and long swords. In contrast, the Inca used weapons made out of wood, stone, copper and bronze, while using an Alpaca fiber based armor, putting them at significant technological disadvantage\u2014none of their weapons could pierce the Spanish steel armor. In addition, due to the absence of horses in the Americas, the Inca did not develop tactics to fight cavalry. However, the Inca were still effective warriors, being able to successfully fight the Mapuche, which later would strategically defeat the Spanish as they expanded further south.\nThe first engagement between the Inca and the Spanish was the Battle of Pun\u00e1, near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador, on the Pacific Coast; Pizarro then founded the city of Piura in July 1532. Hernando de Soto was sent inland to explore the interior and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at Cajamarca with his army of 80,000 troops, that were at the moment armed only with hunting tools (knives and lassos for hunting llamas).\nPizarro and some of his men, most notably a friar named Vincente de Valverde, met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue. The Inca offered them ceremonial chicha in a golden cup, which the Spanish rejected. The Spanish interpreter, Friar Vincente, read the \"Requerimiento\" that demanded that he and his empire accept the rule of King Charles I of Spain and convert to Christianity. Atahualpa dismissed the message and asked them to leave. After this, the Spanish began their attack against the mostly unarmed Inca, captured Atahualpa as hostage, and forced the Inca to collaborate.\nAtahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the room he was imprisoned in and twice that amount of silver. The Inca fulfilled this ransom, but Pizarro deceived them, refusing to release the Inca afterwards. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Hu\u00e1scar was assassinated elsewhere. The Spaniards maintained that this was at Atahualpa's orders; this was used as one of the charges against Atahualpa when the Spaniards finally executed him, in August 1533.Although \"defeat\" often implies an unwanted loss in battle, much of the Inca elite \"actually welcomed the Spanish invaders as liberators and willingly settled down with them to share rule of Andean farmers and miners.\"\n\n\n=== Last Incas ===\n\nThe Spanish installed Atahualpa's brother Manco Inca Yupanqui in power; for some time Manco cooperated with the Spanish while they fought to put down resistance in the north. Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, attempted to claim Cusco. Manco tried to use this intra-Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco in 1536, but the Spanish retook the city afterwards. Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them. In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was conquered and the last ruler, T\u00fapac Amaru, Manco's son, was captured and executed. This ended resistance to the Spanish conquest under the political authority of the Inca state.\nAfter the fall of the Inca Empire many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the vertical archipelago model of agriculture. Spanish colonial officials used the Inca mita corv\u00e9e labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally. One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the titanic silver mine at Potos\u00ed. When a family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family was required to send a replacement.The effects of smallpox on the Inca empire were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Other diseases, including a probable Typhus outbreak in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, and measles in 1618, all ravaged the Inca people.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe number of people inhabiting Tawantinsuyu at its peak is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 4\u201337 million. Most population estimates are in the range of 6 to 14 million. In spite of the fact that the Inca kept excellent census records using their quipus, knowledge of how to read them was lost as almost all fell into disuse and disintegrated over time or were destroyed by the Spaniards.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe empire was extremely linguistically diverse. Some of the most important languages were Quechua, Aymara, Puquina and Mochica, respectively mainly spoken in the Central Andes, the Altiplano or (Qullasuyu), the south Peruvian coast (Kuntisuyu), and the area of the north Peruvian coast (Chinchaysuyu) around Chan Chan, today Trujillo. Other languages included Quignam, Jaqaru, Leco, Uru-Chipaya languages, Kunza, Humahuaca, Cac\u00e1n, Mapudungun, Culle, Chachapoya, Catacao languages, Manta, and Barbacoan languages, as well as numerous Amazonian languages on the frontier regions. The exact linguistic topography of the pre-Columbian and early colonial Andes remains incompletely understood, owing to the extinction of several languages and the loss of historical records.\nIn order to manage this diversity, the Inca lords promoted the usage of Quechua, especially the variety of modern-day Lima  as the Qhapaq Runasimi (\"great language of the people\"), or the official language/lingua franca. Defined by mutual intelligibility, Quechua is actually a family of languages rather than one single language, parallel to the Romance or Slavic languages in Europe. Most communities within the empire, even those resistant to Inca rule, learned to speak a variety of Quechua (forming new regional varieties with distinct phonetics) in order to communicate with the Inca lords and mitma colonists, as well as the wider integrating society, but largely retained their native languages as well. The Incas also had their own ethnic language, referred to as Qhapaq simi (\"royal language\"), which is thought to have been closely related to or a dialect of Puquina, which appears to have been the official language of the former Tiwanaku Empire, from which the Incas claimed descent, making Qhapaq simi a source of prestige for them. The split between Qhapaq simi and Qhapaq Runasimi also exemplifies the larger split between hatun and hunin (high and low) society in general.\nThere are several common misconceptions about the history of Quechua, as it is frequently identified as the \"Inca language\". Quechua did not originate with the Incas, had been a lingua franca in multiple areas before the Inca expansions, was diverse before the rise of the Incas, and it was not the native or original language of the Incas. In addition, the main official language of the Inca Empire was the coastal Quechua variety, native to modern Lima, not the Cusco dialect. The pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom, with whom the Incas struck an alliance, had made this variety into a local prestige language by their extensive trading activities. The Peruvian coast was also the most populous and economically active region of the Inca Empire, and employing coastal Quechua offered an alternative to neighboring Mochica, the language of the rival state of Chimu. Trade had also been spreading Quechua northwards before the Inca expansions, towards Cajamarca and Ecuador, and was likely the official language of the older Wari Empire. However, the Incas have left an impressive linguistic legacy, in that they introduced Quechua to many areas where it is still widely spoken today, including Ecuador, southern Bolivia, southern Colombia, and parts of the Amazon basin. The Spanish conquerors continued the official usage of Quechua during the early colonial period, and transformed it into a literary language.The Incas were not known to develop a written form of language; however, they visually recorded narratives through paintings on vases and cups (qirus). These paintings are usually accompanied by geometric patterns known as toqapu, which are also found in textiles. Researchers have speculated that toqapu patterns could have served as a form of written communication (e.g.: heraldry, or glyphs), however this remains unclear. The Incas also kept records by using quipus.\n\n\n=== Age and defining gender ===\n\nThe high infant mortality rates that plagued the Inca Empire caused all newborn infants to be given the term \u2018wawa\u2019 when they were born. Most families did not invest very much into their child until they reached the age of two or three years old. Once the child reached the age of three, a \"coming of age\" ceremony occurred, called the rutuchikuy. For the Incas, this ceremony indicated that the child had entered the stage of \"ignorance\". During this ceremony, the family would invite all relatives to their house for food and dance, and then each member of the family would receive a lock of hair from the child. After each family member had received a lock, the father would shave the child's head. This stage of life was categorized by a stage of \"ignorance, inexperience, and lack of reason, a condition that the child would overcome with time.\" For Incan society, in order to advance from the stage of ignorance to development the child must learn the roles associated with their gender.\nThe next important ritual was to celebrate the maturity of a child. Unlike the coming of age ceremony, the celebration of maturity signified the child's sexual potency. This celebration of puberty was called warachikuy for boys and qikuchikuy for girls. The warachikuy ceremony included dancing, fasting, tasks to display strength, and family ceremonies. The boy would also be given new clothes and taught how to act as an unmarried man. The qikuchikuy signified the onset of menstruation, upon which the girl would go into the forest alone and return only once the bleeding had ended. In the forest she would fast, and, once returned, the girl would be given a new name, adult clothing, and advice. This \"folly\" stage of life was the time young adults were allowed to have sex without being a parent.Between the ages of 20 and 30, people were considered young adults, \"ripe for serious thought and labor.\" Young adults were able to retain their youthful status by living at home and assisting in their home community. Young adults only reached full maturity and independence once they had married.\nAt the end of life, the terms for men and women denote loss of sexual vitality and humanity. Specifically, the \"decrepitude\" stage signifies the loss of mental well-being and further physical decline.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn the Incan Empire, the age of marriage differed for men and women: men typically married at the age of 20, while women usually got married about four years earlier at the age of 16. Men who were highly ranked in society could have multiple wives, but those lower in the ranks could only take a single wife. Marriages were typically within classes and resembled a more business-like agreement. Once married, the women were expected to cook, collect food and watch over the children and livestock. Girls and mothers would also work around the house to keep it orderly to please the public inspectors. These duties remained the same even after wives became pregnant and with the added responsibility of praying and making offerings to Kanopa, who was the god of pregnancy. It was typical for marriages to begin on a trial basis with both men and women having a say in the longevity of the marriage. If the man felt that it wouldn't work out or if the woman wanted to return to her parents\u2019 home the marriage would end. Once the marriage was final, the only way the two could be divorced was if they did not have a child together. Marriage within the Empire was crucial for survival. A family was considered disadvantaged if there was not a married couple at the center because everyday life centered around the balance of male and female tasks.\n\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nAccording to some historians, such as Terence N. D'Altroy, male and female roles were considered equal in Inca society. The \"indigenous cultures saw the two genders as complementary parts of a whole.\" In other words, there was not a hierarchical structure in the domestic sphere for the Incas. Within the domestic sphere, women were known as the weavers. Women's everyday tasks included: spinning, watching the children, weaving cloth, cooking, brewing chichi, preparing fields for cultivation, planting seeds, bearing children, harvesting, weeding, hoeing, herding, and carrying water. Men on the other hand, \"weeded, plowed, participated in combat, helped in the harvest, carried firewood, built houses, herded llama and alpaca, and spun and wove when necessary\". This relationship between the genders may have been complementary. Unsurprisingly, onlooking Spaniards believed women were treated like slaves, because women did not work in Spanish society to the same extent, and certainly did not work in fields.  Women were sometimes allowed to own land and herds because inheritance was passed down from both the mother's and father's side of the family. Kinship within the Inca society followed a parallel line of descent. In other words, women ascended from women and men ascended from men. Due to the parallel descent, a woman had access to land and other necessities through her mother.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nInca myths were transmitted orally until early Spanish colonists recorded them; however, some scholars claim that they were recorded on quipus, Andean knotted string records.The Inca believed in reincarnation. After death, the passage to the next world was fraught with difficulties. The spirit of the dead, camaquen, would need to follow a long road and during the trip the assistance of a black dog that could see in the dark was required. Most Incas imagined the after world to be like an earthly paradise with flower-covered fields and snow-capped mountains.\nIt was important to the Inca that they not die as a result of burning or that the body of the deceased not be incinerated. Burning would cause their vital force to disappear and threaten their passage to the after world. Those who obeyed the Inca moral code \u2013 ama suwa, ama llulla, ama quella (do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy) \u2013 \"went to live in the Sun's warmth while others spent their eternal days in the cold earth\". The Inca nobility practiced cranial deformation. They wrapped tight cloth straps around the heads of newborns to shape their soft skulls into a more conical form, thus distinguishing the nobility from other social classes.\nThe Incas made human sacrifices. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca Huayna Capac in 1527. The Incas performed child sacrifices around important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca or during a famine. These sacrifices were known as qhapaq hucha.\n\n\n=== Deities ===\n\nThe Incas were polytheists who worshipped many gods. These included:\n\nViracocha (also Pachacamac) \u2013 Created all living things\nApu Illapu \u2013 Rain God, prayed to when they need rain\nAyar Cachi \u2013 Hot-tempered God, causes earthquakes\nIllapa \u2013 Goddess of lightning and thunder (also Yakumama water goddess)\nInti \u2013 sun god and patron deity of the holy city of Cusco (home of the sun)\nKuychi \u2013 Rainbow God, connected with fertility\nMama Killa \u2013 Wife of Inti, called Moon Mother\nMama Occlo \u2013 Wisdom to civilize the people, taught women to weave cloth and build houses\nManco C\u00e1pac \u2013 known for his courage and sent to earth to become first king of the Incas. Taught people how to grow plants, make weapons, work together, share resources and worship the Gods\nPachamama \u2013 The Goddess of earth and wife of Viracocha. People give her offerings of coca leaves and beer and pray to her for major agricultural occasions\nQuchamama \u2013 Goddess of the sea\nSachamama \u2013 Means Mother Tree, goddess in the shape of a snake with two heads\nYakumama \u2013 Means mother Water. Represented as a snake. When she came to earth she transformed into a great river (also Illapa).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Inca Empire employed central planning. The Inca Empire traded with outside regions, although they did not operate a substantial internal market economy. While axe-monies were used along the northern coast, presumably by the provincial mindal\u00e1e trading class, most households in the empire lived in a traditional economy in which households were required to pay taxes, usually in the form of the mit'a corv\u00e9e labor, and military obligations, though barter (or trueque) was present in some areas. In return, the state provided security, food in times of hardship through the supply of emergency resources, agricultural projects (e.g. aqueducts and terraces) to increase productivity and occasional feasts. While mit'a was used by the state to obtain labor, individual villages had a pre-inca system of communal work, known as mink'a. This system survives to the modern day, known as mink'a or faena. The economy rested on the material foundations of the vertical archipelago, a system of ecological complementarity in accessing resources and the cultural foundation of ayni, or reciprocal exchange.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n=== Beliefs ===\n\nThe Sapa Inca was conceptualized as divine and was effectively head of the state religion. The Willaq Umu (or Chief Priest) was second to the emperor. Local religious traditions continued and in some cases such as the Oracle at Pachacamac on the Peruvian coast, were officially venerated. Following Pachacuti, the Sapa Inca claimed descent from Inti, who placed a high value on imperial blood; by the end of the empire, it was common to incestuously wed brother and sister. He was \"son of the sun,\" and his people the intip churin, or \"children of the sun,\" and both his right to rule and mission to conquer derived from his holy ancestor. The Sapa Inca also presided over ideologically important festivals, notably during the Inti Raymi, or \"Sunfest\" attended by soldiers, mummified rulers, nobles, clerics and the general population of Cusco beginning on the June solstice and culminating nine days later with the ritual breaking of the earth using a foot plow by the Inca. Moreover, Cusco was considered cosmologically central, loaded as it was with huacas and radiating ceque lines and geographic center of the Four-Quarters; Inca Garcilaso de la Vega called it \"the navel of the universe\".\n\n\n=== Organization of the empire ===\nThe Inca Empire was a federalist system consisting of a central government with the Inca at its head and four-quarters, or suyu: Chinchay Suyu (NW), Anti Suyu (NE), Kunti Suyu (SW) and Qulla Suyu (SE). The four corners of these quarters met at the center, Cusco. These suyu were likely created around 1460 during the reign of Pachacuti before the empire reached its largest territorial extent. At the time the suyu were established they were roughly of equal size and only later changed their proportions as the empire expanded north and south along the Andes.Cusco was likely not organized as a wamani, or province. Rather, it was probably somewhat akin to a modern federal district, like Washington, DC or Mexico City. The city sat at the center of the four suyu and served as the preeminent center of politics and religion. While Cusco was essentially governed by the Sapa Inca, his relatives and the royal panaqa lineages, each suyu was governed by an Apu, a term of esteem used for men of high status and for venerated mountains. Both Cusco as a district and the four suyu as administrative regions were grouped into upper hanan and lower hurin divisions. As the Inca did not have written records, it is impossible to exhaustively list the constituent wamani. However, colonial records allow us to reconstruct a partial list. There were likely more than 86 wamani, with more than 48 in the highlands and more than 38 on the coast.\n\n\n==== Suyu ====\n\nThe most populous suyu was Chinchaysuyu, which encompassed the former Chimu empire and much of the northern Andes. At its largest extent, it extended through much of modern Ecuador and into modern Colombia.\nThe largest suyu by area was Qullasuyu, named after the Aymara-speaking Qulla people. It encompassed the Bolivian Altiplano and much of the southern Andes, reaching Argentina and as far south as the Maipo or Maule river in Central Chile. Historian Jos\u00e9 Bengoa singled out Quillota as likely being the foremost Inca settlement in Chile.The second smallest suyu, Antisuyu, was northwest of Cusco in the high Andes. Its name is the root of the word \"Andes.\"Kuntisuyu was the smallest suyu, located along the southern coast of modern Peru, extending into the highlands towards Cusco.\n\n\n=== Laws ===\nThe Inca state had no separate judiciary or codified laws. Customs, expectations and traditional local power holders governed behavior. The state had legal force, such as through tokoyrikoq (lit. \"he who sees all\"), or inspectors. The highest such inspector, typically a blood relative to the Sapa Inca, acted independently of the conventional hierarchy, providing a point of view for the Sapa Inca free of bureaucratic influence.The Inca had three moral precepts that governed their behavior:\n\nAma sua: Do not steal\nAma llulla: Do not lie\nAma quella: Do not be lazy\n\n\n=== Administration ===\nColonial sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about Inca government structure, such as exact duties and functions of government positions. But the basic structure can be broadly described. The top was the Sapa Inca. Below that may have been the Willaq Umu, literally the \"priest who recounts\", the High Priest of the Sun. However, beneath the Sapa Inca also sat the Inkap rantin, who was a confidant and assistant to the Sapa Inca, perhaps similar to a Prime Minister. Starting with Topa Inca Yupanqui, a \"Council of the Realm\" was composed of 16 nobles: 2 from hanan Cusco; 2 from hurin Cusco; 4 from Chinchaysuyu; 2 from Cuntisuyu; 4 from Collasuyu; and 2 from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the hanan and hurin divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (hanan suyukuna and hurin suyukuna).While provincial bureaucracy and government varied greatly, the basic organization was decimal. Taxpayers \u2013 male heads of household of a certain age range \u2013 were organized into corv\u00e9e labor units (often doubling as military units) that formed the state's muscle as part of mit'a service. Each unit of more than 100 tax-payers were headed by a kuraka, while smaller units were headed by a kamayuq, a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while kuraka status was hereditary and typically served for life, the position of a kuraka in the hierarchy was subject to change based on the privileges of superiors in the hierarchy; a pachaka kuraka could be appointed to the position by a waranqa kuraka. Furthermore, one kuraka in each decimal level could serve as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that a pachaka kuraka might also be a waranqa kuraka, in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.\n\n\n== Arts and technology ==\n\n\n=== Monumental architecture ===\n\nArchitecture was the most important of the Incan arts, with textiles reflecting architectural motifs. The most notable example is Machu Picchu, which was constructed by Inca engineers. The prime Inca structures were made of stone blocks that fit together so well that a knife could not be fitted through the stonework. These constructs have survived for centuries, with no use of mortar to sustain them.\nThis process was first used on a large scale by the Pucara (c. 300 BC\u2013AD 300) peoples to the south in Lake Titicaca and later in the city of Tiwanaku (c. AD 400\u20131100) in present-day Bolivia. The rocks were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed. The tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable, despite the ongoing challenge of earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\n\n=== Measures, calendrics and mathematics ===\n\nPhysical measures used by the Inca were based on human body parts. Units included fingers, the distance from thumb to forefinger, palms, cubits and wingspans. The most basic distance unit was thatkiy or thatki, or one pace. The next largest unit was reported by Cobo to be the topo or tupu, measuring 6,000 thatkiys, or about 7.7 km (4.8 mi); careful study has shown that a range of 4.0 to 6.3 km (2.5 to 3.9 mi) is likely. Next was the wamani, composed of 30 topos (roughly 232 km or 144 mi). To measure area, 25 by 50 wingspans were used, reckoned in topos (roughly 3,280 km2 or 1,270 sq mi). It seems likely that distance was often interpreted as one day's walk; the distance between tambo way-stations varies widely in terms of distance, but far less in terms of time to walk that distance.Inca calendars were strongly tied to astronomy. Inca astronomers understood equinoxes, solstices and zenith passages, along with the Venus cycle. They could not, however, predict eclipses. The Inca calendar was essentially lunisolar, as two calendars were maintained in parallel, one solar and one lunar. As 12 lunar months fall 11 days short of a full 365-day solar year, those in charge of the calendar had to adjust every winter solstice. Each lunar month was marked with festivals and rituals. Apparently, the days of the week were not named and days were not grouped into weeks. Similarly, months were not grouped into seasons. Time during a day was not measured in hours or minutes, but in terms of how far the sun had travelled or in how long it had taken to perform a task.The sophistication of Inca administration, calendrics and engineering required facility with numbers. Numerical information was stored in the knots of quipu strings, allowing for compact storage of large numbers. These numbers were stored in base-10 digits, the same base used by the Quechua language and in administrative and military units. These numbers, stored in quipu, could be calculated on yupanas, grids with squares of positionally varying mathematical values, perhaps functioning as an abacus. Calculation was facilitated by moving piles of tokens, seeds or pebbles between compartments of the yupana. It is likely that Inca mathematics at least allowed division of integers into integers or fractions and multiplication of integers and fractions.According to mid-17th-century Jesuit chronicler Bernab\u00e9 Cobo, the Inca designated officials to perform accounting-related tasks. These officials were called quipo camayos. Study of khipu sample VA 42527 (Museum f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde, Berlin) revealed that the numbers arranged in calendrically significant patterns were used for agricultural purposes in the \"farm account books\" kept by the khipukamayuq (accountant or warehouse keeper) to facilitate the closing of accounting books.\n\n\n=== Ceramics, precious metals and textiles ===\n\nCeramics were painted using the polychrome technique portraying numerous motifs including animals, birds, waves, felines (popular in the Chavin culture) and geometric patterns found in the Nazca style of ceramics. In a culture without a written language, ceramics portrayed the basic scenes of everyday life, including the smelting of metals, relationships and scenes of tribal warfare. The most distinctive Inca ceramic objects are the Cusco bottles or \"aryballos\". Many of these pieces are on display in Lima in the Larco Archaeological Museum and the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History.\nAlmost all of the gold and silver work of the Incan empire was melted down by the conquistadors, and shipped back to Spain.\n\n\n=== Communication and medicine ===\nThe Inca recorded information on assemblages of knotted strings, known as Quipu, although they can no longer be decoded. Originally it was thought that Quipu were used only as mnemonic devices or to record numerical data. Quipus are also believed to record history and literature.The Inca made many discoveries in medicine. They performed successful skull surgery, by cutting holes in the skull to alleviate fluid buildup and inflammation caused by head wounds. Many skull surgeries performed by Inca surgeons were successful. Survival rates were 80\u201390%, compared to about 30% before Inca times.\n\n\n=== Coca ===\n\nThe Incas revered the coca plant as sacred/magical. Its leaves were used in moderate amounts to lessen hunger and pain during work, but were mostly used for religious and health purposes. The Spaniards took advantage of the effects of chewing coca leaves. The Chasqui, messengers who ran throughout the empire to deliver messages, chewed coca leaves for extra energy. Coca leaves were also used as an anaesthetic during surgeries.\n\n\n=== Weapons, armor and warfare ===\n\nThe Inca army was the most powerful at that time, because any ordinary villager or farmer could be recruited as a soldier as part of the mit'a system of mandatory public service. Every able bodied male Inca of fighting age had to take part in war in some capacity at least once and to prepare for warfare again when needed. By the time the empire reached its largest size, every section of the empire contributed in setting up an army for war.\nThe Incas had no iron or steel and their weapons were not much more effective than those of their opponents so they often defeated opponents by sheer force of numbers, or else by persuading them to surrender beforehand by offering generous terms. Inca weaponry included \"hardwood spears launched using throwers, arrows, javelins, slings, the bolas, clubs, and maces with star-shaped heads made of copper or bronze.\" Rolling rocks downhill onto the enemy was a common strategy, taking advantage of the hilly terrain. Fighting was sometimes accompanied by drums and trumpets made of wood, shell or bone. Armor included:\nHelmets made of wood, cane, or animal skin, often lined with copper or bronze; some were adorned with feathers\nRound or square shields made from wood or hide\nCloth tunics padded with cotton and small wooden planks to protect the spine\nCeremonial metal breastplates, of copper, silver, and gold, have been found in burial sites, some of which may have also been used in battle.Roads allowed quick movement (on foot) for the Inca army and shelters called tambo and storage silos called qullqas were built one day's travelling distance from each other, so that an army on campaign could always be fed and rested. This can be seen in names of ruins such as Ollantay Tambo, or My Lord's Storehouse. These were set up so the Inca and his entourage would always have supplies (and possibly shelter) ready as they traveled.\n\n\n=== Banner of the Inca ===\n\nChronicles and references from the 16th and 17th centuries support the idea of a banner. However, it represented the Inca (emperor), not the empire.\nFrancisco L\u00f3pez de Jerez wrote in 1534:\n\n... todos ven\u00edan repartidos en sus escuadras con sus banderas y capitanes que los mandan, con tanto concierto como turcos.(... all of them came distributed into squads, with their flags and captains commanding them, as well-ordered as Turks.) \nChronicler Bernab\u00e9 Cobo wrote:\n\nThe royal standard or banner was a small square flag, ten or twelve spans around, made of cotton or wool cloth, placed on the end of a long staff, stretched and stiff such that it did not wave in the air and on it each king painted his arms and emblems, for each one chose different ones, though the sign of the Incas was the rainbow and two parallel snakes along the width with the tassel as a crown, which each king used to add for a badge or blazon those preferred, like a lion, an eagle and other figures.\n(... el gui\u00f3n o estandarte real era una banderilla cuadrada y peque\u00f1a, de diez o doce palmos de ruedo, hecha de lienzo de algod\u00f3n o de lana, iba puesta en el remate de una asta larga, tendida y tiesa, sin que ondease al aire, y en ella pintaba cada rey sus armas y divisas, porque cada uno las escog\u00eda diferentes, aunque las generales de los Incas eran el arco celeste y dos culebras tendidas a lo largo paralelas con la borda que le serv\u00eda de corona, a las cuales sol\u00eda a\u00f1adir por divisa y blas\u00f3n cada rey las que le parec\u00eda, como un le\u00f3n, un \u00e1guila y otras figuras.)-Bernab\u00e9 Cobo, Historia del Nuevo Mundo (1653)\nGuaman Poma's 1615 book, El primer nueva cor\u00f3nica y buen gobierno, shows numerous line drawings of Inca flags. In his 1847 book A History of the Conquest of Peru, \"William H. Prescott ... says that in the Inca army each company had its particular banner and that the imperial standard, high above all, displayed the glittering device of the rainbow, the armorial ensign of the Incas.\" A 1917 world flags book says the Inca \"heir-apparent ... was entitled to display the royal standard of the rainbow in his military campaigns.\"In modern times the rainbow flag has been wrongly associated with the Tawantinsuyu and displayed as a symbol of Inca heritage by some groups in Peru and Bolivia. The city of Cusco also flies the Rainbow Flag, but as an official flag of the city. The Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo (2001\u20132006) flew the Rainbow Flag in Lima's presidential palace. However, according to Peruvian historiography, the Inca Empire never had a flag. Peruvian historian Mar\u00eda Rostworowski said, \"I bet my life, the Inca never had that flag, it never existed, no chronicler mentioned it\". Also, to the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, the flag dates to the first decades of the 20th century, and even the Congress of the Republic of Peru has determined that flag is a fake by citing the conclusion of National Academy of Peruvian History:\n\n\"The official use of the wrongly called 'Tawantinsuyu flag' is a mistake. In the Pre-Hispanic Andean World there did not exist the concept of a flag, it did not belong to their historic context\".National Academy of Peruvian History\n\n\n== Adaptations to altitude ==\nIncas were able to adapt to their high-altitude living through successful acclimatization, which is characterized by increasing oxygen supply to the blood tissues. For the native Inca living in the Andean highlands, this was achieved through the development of a larger lung capacity, and an increase in red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, and capillary beds.Compared to other humans, the Incas had slower heart rates, almost one-third larger lung capacity, about 2 L (4 pints) more blood volume and double the amount of hemoglobin, which transfers oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. While the Conquistadors may have been slightly taller, the Inca had the advantage of coping with the extraordinary altitude.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Important Incan archeological sites ===\n\n\n=== Incan-related ===\n\n\n=== General ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 (2013). \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 XVI\u2013XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432: \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430.

          "Like most Peruvian markets, the San Pedro is an explosion of color mixed with sights and smells that are welcoming and sometimes off-putting. Whatever you want, you can find it here. My husband and I especially like wandering the food isles as you never know what you'll find.",

          "There is a variety of food, juices, clothing and souvenirs that can be found here. Managed to get some good bargains, buying blankets, ponchos and jumpers which was what we were after. Walk around first and see what's out there before you start buying though. Would recommend",
          "Anything you could want to buy in Peru can be found here, jewelry, Alpaca clothing, handmade bags, gifts of all kinds, and food. The back of the market is full of food stands serving authentic Peruvian food. Many of the vendors accept Visa making it convenient for travelers not",

          "Wonderful place to wonder around. Excellent place to purchase chocolate, fresh fruits, flowers & local goods. Be sure if you see something you like to shop around before you buy. Another vendor will save you a few soles. But it really ends up to who will talk with you about",

          "I cook, it is a hobby and a passion, and so toodling around this market was so much fun for me. It is within walking distance to the areas most tourists stay in Cusco. It is a covered market (meaning out of the rain) and occupies an entire block. I purchased my breakfast here",
          "I always enjoy markets in another country as you see their day to day life without as much touristic glitter. The ingredients for food are particularly interesting as the corn, potatoes, fruit and vegetables will show up in most Peruvian restaurants so i find it fun to learn",
          "Pleasant way to spend a morning and buy your lunch along the way. The fruit juices were great. There must be at least 20 women competing for your business and they do sell to take away. The cheeses are fantastic and if you ask you can try before you buy.",
          "I loved walking through the market. It was BUSY on Saturday, but that made it special. You've got your meat section with sausage being made there, pork cut to order (pigs heads hanging too), and more. You've got your cheese section, grains/quinoa section, flowers, fruits, fruit",

          "I didn't get very much from visiting the market, it was very noticeable that a lot of the food wasn't being kept in the best condition so I wasn't really tempted to eat anything. It was visually quite interesting but the smells were quite intense.",
          "This and the neighboring markets are so awesome. Great eats with 2 or 3 course meals starting at 5 Soles, but you should spring for the 15 Soles Lechon single portion and split it with someone. Literally the best Lechon I've ever had and not for lack of trying around the Globe.",

          "A must visit for shopping for souvenirs and for local food. Anything a street vendor wants to sell you in the tourist areas, you will get here with no hassle and half the price. Local food, this is the place. Sit down and enjoy a \"Menu Completo\" where the meal is prepared",
          "Walking through this market and the surrounding shops was fascinating. Yes, there are lots of vendors of typical tourist stuff. But the locals shop here too, for food and fabrics, etc. And definitely do yourself a favor and get a jugo fresco; orange mango was delicious. But",

          "It is full of things making your eyes amazed and mouth watering. Heaps and bunches of fruit you perhaps did not ever see or think they exist. Prices are very friendly for European, at least. You could try \"sopa\" right there, it smells and looks delicious. There are plenty of",
          "We son and I had a great time exploring the San Pedro Market. It was an excellent balance of local provisions and tourist fun. Most of the merchants offered samples of their products and we bought quite a few things we tried. We had been warned about pick pockets and thieves,",
          "The market includes food, bags, backpacks and trinkets. The prices are really low, though you can definitely negotiate. There isn't much variety in terms of merchandise, but you'll definitely find something to keep",
          "Many vendors selling everything from Alpaca wool hats & blankets, t-shirts, purses, scarfs, pull overs, and other souvenirs. Food court area with interesting food selections as well. I love local markets as there is no better way to get a feel for the local culture than by",

          "Make sure to grab a juice at the market and stack up on fruits or anything you might need. Always bargain, specially when buying fruit by the kilo. The food is good, but it's not for everyone. Most of the locals eat there so the food is safe.",
          "This is a big and very interesting supermarket to see and explore in Cusco. It is a very lively place with lots to see, smell, taste, and buy. There are so many vendors selling affordable souvenirs, clothes, juices, vegetables, fruits, bread, cheese, meat and types of food. This",
          "We visited the market to buy fresh fruit thinking we would get a better price then at Orion Supermercado. We soon found out if you are \"gringo\" the price doubles. When we told the lady her prices are higher then the supermercado her reply was , \"then go shop there\". So we do!",
          "This is one of the biggest and most interesting markets in Peru and maybe in South America. It has everything inside and outside too. Other advisors already wrote rave reviews about the place and I don't want to write the same thing. Their pictures show it all. We were in Cusco",
          "I have to say we didn't quite know what to expect when we walked in but found it absolutely mesmerising all of the different stalls selling all kinds of different foods; fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, breads, beans, pulses, grains all in huge sizes and quantities! In",

          "This place is very cool! The juice vendors and the food counters! We had a 2 course meal of fresh Peruvian food and a drink for a total of 10 sol. We left very full and satisfied. This is a great place to get souvenirs as the vendors are there to help but they don't harass you",
          "This is one of the most diverse and lively markets I've seen, with everything from food to clothes to sundries being sold. The sections for breads and cheese are extensive, and there are also a couple of casual sit-down restaurants to get a cheap meal. A feast for the senses!",
          "We visited the market as part of a private tour of Cusco. Just a short walk from the main square. So much to see - it is a feast for the eyes! We stopped for a glass of fresh juice- delicious! If we had more time we would have returned for a more leisurely visit",

          "We loved this market. We ate here on a few occasions, food is cheap and cheerful. The juices and smoothies were delicious and the ladies very friendly and chatty. We bought fruit, nuts, oats, eggs etc. here and it's great value, all very fresh too. A great spot to visit!",
          "Chicken soup...fresh fruit juice...cheese...and many more local cheap stuff... you can expect to pay less than 5sol for food. Handcraft here are cheaper than those stores around the main plaza. Bargaining is a must!!",
          "Some people say that something you can.'t miss when you visit a town is to visit its market and this is a very colorful place full of all kinds of products. As a peruvian I have visited many markets in my city but going to this one in Cuzco was more than I ever expected. So many",
          "Everything is for sale here, from souvenirs to fresh fish, meat, cheese, fruit juices and complete meals. Great experience.",
          "Great place where all kinds of fruit, meat, herbs, spices are sold and eaten in seamingly make-shift stalls! Real people doing real business. Just wander around and try some stuff you like, the food is conveniently organised by category. A little downside is that the tourist",
          "If you're going to be staying in Cusco for a while and you want to cook yourself a meal the San Pedro market is the place to go to get your ingredients. The market is decently clean and there is a huge variety of vendors selling every fruit/veg/meat you can imagine. There are",

          "A bustling & popular market in Cusco centre, with a huge range of souvenir, produce & food stalls. I recommend grabbing a made-to-order fruit juice from one of the many stands as you enter & also visiting Mari\u2019s food stand (#837) at the back of the market for delicious cheap",
          "Loved it here. Right past the Arch of San Francisco, a quick walk from the main square. The first thing you'll see when walking in are the rows and rows for fresh juice. Do yourself a favor - order a refreshing, fresh juice and sit down to relax. They have stools all over the",

          "The market is not that great in terms of stalls and variety of products. They sell the same things as everywhere else. However one thing that is really good about the market is the many food stalls serving cheap set lunches which are available for between 5-10 soles. I recommend",
          "A great place to buy souvenirs and eat lunch. Try the food stalls! You will not be disappointed. And so cheap! A full meal for about 5 Soles.",
          "Happened to be in the immediate area during one of Cusco's infrequent rainstorms. The mercado is reasonably watertight. It is divided into a central area of 2 or 3 lengthy corridors that demarcate the \"food court,\" a periphery of stalls that offer soft goods, and additional rows",
          "Easy to find a few blocks from plaza de armas .Large building with tons of food ,fresh squeezed fruit drinks , cheese, meats.Quinoa,nuts & several stalls preparing meals. Very social gathering around a meal.plus tons of touristic items,backpacks, bags,t shirts,key chains, mugs,",

          "This market was fun to explore but I must say, after being around most of Peru, it is NOT cheap. Of course it's cheap if you're a westerner but compared to the rest of the markets in , say, Arequipa, Lima and other most other cities, you'll likely be paying more here than the",
          "Markets are great to experience culture. Locals are doing there grocery shopping, eating the breakfast and are haggling for the best and lowest prices. This market is no exception and a must visit while visiting Cusco. It is situated in the centre of the city and can be seen in",
          "Awesome market. Highlight of my entire trip in Peru. Food, clothing, desserts, spices and seeds. Anything you could ever want is here. It shows the culture of cusco. Women are tailoring clothing in the entrance and then the typical vendors selling the fabrics and bags.",

          "This is a typical market in South America, where you can get pretty much everything. There are tons of different stalls though they tend to be grouped according the their specialty. It is a crowded place and I would not recommend people eating here unless you have a bullet proof",
          "Crowded, and beware of pickpockets, but otherwise a great place to buy souvenirs, We had done our teenagers souvenir shipping from regular touristy places, and found the exact same things for a fraction of the prices, we ended up getting more things just because they were so",
          "This Mercado has \u201ceverything\u201d a shopper wants and needs. Starting with clothing, handicrafts to the actual fruits, vegetables, meats, herbal items and magic potions. The meats, including the famous Cuy (the pig) are all found here. Even if you do not want to buy, you can get",
          "We did not get to eat at the market, so we just shopped around. It is very similar to a farmers market- mostly fresh produce, a food court, and clothing. There were lots of alpaca sweaters to choose from and relatively cheap - you can definitely bargain. I love visiting farmers",
          "San Pedro Market is a hub for locals (and visitors) to gather and buy produce, meats, and other goods. It's a bustling, crowded place with loud corridors and a variety of products. You could spend a few hours walking it, and it's surrounding plaza. I got mixed opinions from",
          "The central market in Cusco is a veritable mix of fresh produce, juice bars, local food and souvenir shops. We stopped by most days to have breakfast juices and/or lunch at one of the many stalls. The ceviche is tasty and we love the different fish. If your on a budget you'll",
          "As I do as a ritual every time I go to Cusco is visit this market. Most of tourists go to have a very interesting tour: taking pics of fruits and regular life in Cusco. In my case, I go shopping from bread or cheese for family and friends and mostly, I go to drink fresh fruit",
          "This market is large, colorful, active, and offers everything from food to flowers to clothing. The market opens early and winds down in the late afternoon. This market offers a chance to experience Cusco, take pictures, enjoy \"Peruvian home cooking\" at a kiosk, and ask",
          "Organised into different sections/rows, the market has it all- from fresh produce to cheap tourist knick-knacks. The fresh fruit juice was a delicious. I highly recommend the chicken noodle soup (free soup and noodle refill!)! We saw locals and tourists eating there so had no",
          "If you like local markets this is the one for you. There are the most amazing set of ladies selling fresh fruit drinks prepared before your eyes, great value and great taste. The rest of the market is all fresh food- meat, cheese, veg, fruit. Anything you could want. Plus the",
          "A must see when you come to Cusco. I believe this is the largest market in Cusco, and certainly has a fabulous selection of foods and souvenirs at excellent pries. On Saturdays the market is more oriented to locals, but still worth the visit. Keep your stuff close at all times!",

          "This was definitely one of the most interesting stops in any of the urban centers I visited while in Peru. You can learn a lot about a culture by checking out their local foods. This place is huge. You'll find meats, vegetables, herbals, textiles, shamanic goods, tourist",
          "Nice little market which has all the juice, meats, cheeses, nuts, and souvenirs you want. There is also a health section to fix any aliments. Not that i tried any, but it's a good free tourist attraction to look. Make sure to see Shirley at stall 81, she makes a mean juice",
          "Visited during a Sunday afternoon so some stalls were closed up. There are plenty of souvenir stalls but of greater interest are the food stalls. Fresh juices with fruits we weren't familiar with but all delicious. Always interesting to see how cultures sell their food and how",

          "Huge local market with a variety of different goods for sale. Meats, vegetables, fruits, flowers, section of food stalls, etc. Easy to walk to from Plaza de Armas. We took a taxi from Plaza San Blas only because they had all the roads closed and blocked on Friday the 24th",
          "This is a must see for those who are traveling in Cusco. This is a true marketplace for the locals. My group did not buy anything in the market place, but that was not from a lack of buying opportunities. The market is an easy walk from the central square even with children",
          "The market is big. It contains different sections as fruit, vegetables, meat, cooked food, clothes, souvenir, etc. The fresh extracted fruit juice is delicious, and costs no more than 5 soles for two cups. Cooked food stall is crowed with locals. The food looks interesting, but",

          "This place really worth a visit! It is a proper market with various type of fruits, food, vegetable, fish, etc., but I liked this market more than any other I have seen in Peru or Bolivia. It is a great place to have there delicious and cheap lunch and also if you want to try",
          "I loved my time in the Mercado Central!! Be sure to stop and have a smoothie. One will easily serve two to three people. While some may be put off by the sights in the meat aisles, it gave me an appreciation for Peruvian nose to tail eating. Lots of shopping available for",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "Not to be missed when visiting Cusco. The Cathedral is huge, in fact you'll visit 3 churches that had different purposes. We had a guide for the visit and that was very helpful. Incredible to see this in the middle of the Inca world!!",
          "This is possibly the most ornate cathedral I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019ve been to the Vatican! It\u2019s truly lovely. No pictures are allowed inside, so you can either purchase a book or commit it to memory. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit.",
          "We went to see the old paintings from XVI, XVII and XVIII century. Worth it because we have seen ton of paintings and sculptures. For sure we hired a local guide to learn and get the information. It takes one hour and a half to walk around.",

          "Cusco Cathedral is very large, with some beautiful things to see inside! Sadly, no interior pictures allowed. Definitely worth a visit. There was one painting of the Last Supper where we were pretty sure they were eating cuy (guinea pig), we thought that was an interesting",
          "So glad I visited this monument. The art, beauty, gold, silver, statues...everything was just full of history and beauty. Unfortunately, we were harrassed by the tour guides because we did a self guided tour. They accused us of stealing their work. Also, ALL descriptions have",

          "A beautiful building which has stood the test of time. It always amazes me how they built such fantastic places when there was no modern tools like today. If you like looking around old buildings this is a must as it's not only the brickwork that is amazing but the wood carvings",

          "The Cathedral is definitely worth a visit. Even if you have seen enough churches elsewhere in the world, this one is very special with many Incan (or other mysterious) features incorporated, discreetly or otherwise. It will be good to hire a guide to explain you all the stories",
          "We stopped by here during our Cusco visit. The church is large and beautiful! Be on the lookout for the Peruvian version painting of the Last Supper! Why it\u2019s the Peruvian version? Because the Guinea Pug was painted as the Last Supper meal!! Unfortunately, you are not allowed to",

          "Overly ornate and clearly has much history but I cant say I enjoy visiting religious relics. I normally avoid visiting religious places but this was part of our tour. If you like massive edifices showing the riches of the church then I am sure this will stand out. No photos",

          "Absolutely unbelievable. This is 100% a must. You HAVE to go here. What an amazing place. The architecture is stunning, old and baroque. The inside is gorgeous and just as beautiful as the outside. If I had to describe this in one word, it would be unreal. So beautiful",
          "This is the best cathedral I\u2019ve ever visited and was a joy to visit. The cathedral is comprised of 3 wonderful churches within the same complex. Apparently took 300 years to complete and you can see why.",
          "I guess as the cathedral is religious based I should be giving it 5 stars. An interesting and cultural visit as you see how the cathedral has developed over the years.",
          "If you like visiting these types of places then this is a good example of Spanish colonialism meets South America. Not photos allowed inside and try to go with a guide.",
          "To see its true treasures you have to get inside. It's golden and light everywhere. The only thing I didn't like much was the entrance. The man ask for it very unfriendly and pushed us forward. Maybe there are alternatives. In case not, you should give this cathedral a visit!",
          "What should have been an interesting tour was completely spoiled by having other tour groups moving past ALL THE TIME and a guide who clearly wanted to rush us through. So we learnt very little. A shame.",

          "Built using lots of the rocks and gold coming from the Inca sites surrounding Cuzco. Entrance fee 25 soles. The cathedral is divided in 3 parts, each of which contains multiple large paintings, golden art and more over-the-top decorations. You'll enter the least decorated first.",
          "We stopped only because of the rows of \"army\" troops (complete with guns) lined up facing this spectacular church! When the doors opened, I got in line & went into this spectacular church, in the heart of Cusco. While I didn't stay for the service, I stayed long enough to",
          "The cathedral is very large with numerous artworks by local artists of the time. In the art you can see how cultures were merged to ensure the church was able to \"win over\" the populace. Regardless of the issues it gives an insight to the history",

          "We hired an English speaking guide. Well worth it as we were told so much about the Spanish attempt to stamp out Inka beliefs. The size and amounts of silver used in the alter are incredible. Open for Mass to enjoy a Spanish homily of 20min! Buy the book as no photos allowed.",

          "Our guide said most Pope will make it a point to visit this Cathedral during their tenure. And once inside you will be amazed why. The display of religious artifacts and relics all in solid gold and silver will mesmerize you. I was in Vatican the year before, but there is no",
          "The Cusco Cathedral houses around 300 paintings from the Cusco school. The church has a symbolic pulpit beautifully carved in one piece wood which is dated almost 400 years ago.",
          "Absolutely beautiful Cathedral with gorgeous works of art and gold and silver items. Very interesting tour through the building shedding light on the Spanish and Inca influences.",
          "Cathedral is loaded with history and great art. We visited it while in Cusco on our tour with PeruAgency Tours.",
          "This cathedral started out as what you come to expect, but the further you delved into its stories and history the more you realised the input the local beliefs have had. The belief in mother nature is intricately woven into the traditional religious beliefs to create some",
          "You actually get to see three churches in one building. The architecture, carvings, statues are breathtaking. Plenty to see and well worth a visit, made all the more enjoyable by our guide from Coltur.",
          "Quite expensive to enter plus extra for a guide (we payed 40sol for half an hour) but very impressive. Would also recommend to hire a guide as there was a lot of information that else you wouldn't have known.",
          "The architecture is stunning! Against the bright blue sky, it's a beautiful building with interesting architecture!",
          "There\u2019s a huge surprising sensation when I went visiting Cusco. On one hand there\u2019s the beauty and pride of ancient Spanish colonialism in South America and unfortunately on the other hand dire poverty and dirt and litter and dust filling up the air and environment when you go",
          "I'm not religious, but it's really that this place, between history and architecture, has got you so much time and so many things happened, that you can not but be really caught up in what you see. super recommended",
          "Gorgeous cathedral, no wonder it\u2019s a crown jewel in Cusco. English speaking tour guides are available for hire at the doors. About 20S per person. Worth every bit. There also and audio your available at the ticket counter. Sticking views not to be missed",
          "This Catedral is BIG... you almost get lost. I had a bad feeling in this church. Wrong energy. So many paintings, so many statues. So many people who watch if you dont take a picture. The guides that you gave to pay, do the job as a routine. They tell the same story all",
          "Stunning gold and silver guided cathedral with interesting Incan \u201cEaster eggs\u201d in the canvases. Also multiple architectural types in one space. No photos allowed inside.",
          "The impressive Cusco Cathedral that was built on the site of a former destroyed Inca temple is full of impressive gold leaf covered alters and statues created with gold stolen from the Incas by the Spanish conquistadores. It offers a striking example of their crusade to",
          "We were here on a tour and we did not have enough time to truly explore. It's a beautiful cathedral and clearly one of the focal points of the city.",
          "Interesting and worth a visit to what they claim is the largest Catholic Church in South America (may require some verification).",
          "If you are into overly sentimental ,mawkish catholic treacle, visit this site. The art is indeed wonderful but it is overwhelming with dripping catholic maudlin iconography.",
          "Inside the plaza is a great architectural and archeological display of how the Inca were able to construct their empire of stone. Evidence of tongue and groove carving into the stone is demonstrated and not visible at any ruins but is a great revelation.",
          "Recommend taking the tour to get the most out of the visit. My guide pointed out various signs of resistance to Spanish evangelization and the mixing of Andean spirituality with Christian ideology, all of which I would have missed viewing it on my own",
          "Seen one, seen them all, although this one is built on the ruins of earlier Inca buildings so thats different.",
          "it looks pretty grand from outside, I couldn't get in. the view from the plaza is super. its quaint to see a macdonalds just next to it!",
          "The architecture, art & history of this beautiful cathedral in downtown Cusco is worth a visit. If you have a private knowledgeable tour guide, this may likely make your experience better. There are stories about some of the art, especially, that are best learned with a local,",
          "I really don't want to leave this small town. It looks lovely. There are restaurant and shops at the square. It is good to spend time here for a couple of days.",
          "A magnificent cathedral with beautiful paintings, elaborate carvings and gorgeous golden alters. Worth a visit.",
          "We went here in the afternoon because we really wanted to see the Last Supper mural-the main course is Cuy! It was quite cool and we were pleasantly surprised by the cathedral itself. It is HUGE and all the detailed carvings and colors are unreal! We didn't have a guide,",
          "This one of the biggest cathedrals i have ever come accross. More or less four churches in one and most still authentic",
          "If you go into the cathedral, look for the Last Supper Mural. There is Guiney Pig is being served on the dinner table and Jesus is signalling with his fingers that he wants two of them, one of the apostles is looking right at you as well. A lot of money was taken from the locals",
          "Cusco cathedral is really three cathedrals end to end, built ad different times, and as a result with an enormous sense of space inside. The really interesting thing is the artwork, mostly produced by local painters, who impart aspects of Peruvian life into paintings depicting",
          "For entrance you must pay 25 soles which seems excessive and just a tourist money grab unfortunately. Despite this the magnificence of the building can be appreciated from just the exterior for free! The place can be observed in all its glory from the main central plaza.",
          "Of course the Cusco cathedral is a must see, but 25 soles to visit seems a bit steep. That said, I suggest you spend an additional 5 soles to gain entrance to San Cristobal and the Templo San Blas so you can amortize the cost over three sites and make a nice morning or afternoon",
          "I have been in a lot of cathedrals during my travels and this one rates right up there at the top. The amount of silver and gold that was used in the various chapels and alters is just mind boggling. The original alter made of wood is spectacular as is the newer alter that was",
          "Across from the Jesuit church is the cathedral, which is really 3 churches in one complex. There is art and gold everywhere. One very interesting painting is the last supper with a guinea pig on the table. You could not make this up.",
          "Construction of this impressive building began 460 years ago - on the site of an Inca temple, using stone blocks from the temple and another nearby Inca site. The Spaniards even used Inca labour for the construction! Despite the attempted obliteration of the Inca culture, this",
          "The Cusco catherdral does not hold huge expanses for seating people but it is the richness of the altars and the art work that makes it so appealing. Look for the original painting of Jesus at the last supper eating Guinea pig. Look at the black Jesus and wonder how and why",
          "The Spanish invaders to Peru removed Inkan structures and built stunning and ornate churches. Here there are three distinctly different churches blended together with a different theme within each one. They are spectacular and the ornateness and the artwork is truly something to",
          "It was SO beautiful and spectacular to be here during the day and even at sunset- some Of my most favorite photos were taken here and the history of the cathedral is truly interesting.",
          "After a morning of touring the city our guide took us to Cusco Cathedral. Since we had several young adults and teenagers, we should have done the Cathedral on a separate day because after the city ruins and so much more to see, the teenagers were a bit overloaded by the time",
          "When you walk in and around and through this cathedral you get the feeling that it's one of the most beautiful cathedrals anywhere. The magnificence of the many side altars is a sight to behold! We had our tour director who explained so much to us. This is clearly a MUST - DO",
          "You have not visited Cusco if have not seen this place. a 3-part church, in an impessive well maintained status (altough severly damaged by earthquakes).",
          "What an amazing Cathedral, it is huge, we had a guide for this which I would highly recommend, there is a lot of gold leaf and silver in this Cathedral. certainly worth the visit if you are in Cusco",
          "Just looks big from the outside, but the inside is another story. Full of statues and religious symbols it is marvelous. Sadly, photography is not allowed. But a must see if you visit Cusco. Highly recommend a guide so you can understand what you are looking at.",
          "The tour was so much more than I imagined it would be. Very informative and the cathedral is beyond beautiful.",
          "Yes, we only went in to see the Last Supper with Guinnea Pig painting, but ended up lingering in order to truly take in the grandeur of this building. Would definitely recommend.",
          "Part of our tour, this massive cathedral holds so many details of the history of Cusco. Gold leaf tabernacles, paintings and cedar carvings that are mild blowing. Worthwhile going with a tour to explain all the details of this massive Cathedral",
          "Be sure you have plenty of time to appreciate this building It goes on forever with many interesting side chapels.",
          "The cathedral is ver interesting with many intricately carved alters clad in gold leaf. To appreciate the many paintings and sculptures it is probably better to have a guide to point things out. Don't miss The Last Supper with the aposles all sitting around a roast guinea pig.",
          "This place is nice as a museum, you will find many paintaing belong to the old local people, the worse is that you must pay 25 soles, and the next day I saw that people got it for free during the morning in the masses hours.",
          "There is no overlooking the majestic Renaissance-style Cusco Cathedral on the Plaza de Armas. This is really a complex of 3 churches, joined together, that includes the Church of the Holy Family and the Church of Triumph. Completed in 1654, the Cathedral took a mere 100 years to",
          "It is a must to visit the cathedral. You cannot miss it. It is located at the main square surrounded by more cultural buildings",
          "My visit to Peru drove home the unbelievable atrocity the Spanish unleashed on the hapless locals, decimating them and stripping them of their rich culture, simple heritage and limitless engineering skills. All in the name of religion. The beauty is that the Inca survived that",
          "The place is nice, very colonial but you have to pay a ticket of 25 soles, as US$ 8, inside you can not take any picture.",
          "This cathedral is large and very beautiful. Many interesting pieces of art. Not be missed when in Cuzco.",
          "once again go with a tour. this is one of the most beautiful and interesting cathedrals in Peru. it is a combination of Inca and Catholic interpretations, the black Jesus is very non traditional representation. the guinea pig in the last supper painting,the extra person etc",
          "They sell the option to the Christ (where you will get panoramic Views) DON\u00b4T BUY IT... The access is FREE!!! Overall the cathedral is good to see if you are interest in history/architecture. You will also be able to observe some paintings of the characters that passed through",
          "Lovely interior and facade. Contains the original painting of the Last Supper with the cuy. Perhaps a bit pricy, and not included on the tourist ticket.",
          "In this Cathedral you can see the black Jesus, and the Last Supper with a roasted guinea pig - seriously! No photos or videos at all allowed.",
          "People visiting Cusco would definitely want to visit this cathedral . It is a master piece Spanish architecture built in the heart of Cusco",
          "The reason for going here was to see the picture of the last supper with the guinea pig as the meal. The artist was an Incan, designed but the Spanish to convert the Incas into Christians. Judas in the picture is of the leader of the concistadors. The eyes follow you as you move",
          "A must see in Cusco. This is one of the largest, most beautiful cathedrals we've seen. It was a great example of what the Spanish did after they conquered the Incas. There is a lot of silver items and the Cathedral contains a black Jesus. Also has the Last Supper painting that",
          "This is a wonderful example of the way in which a Catholic cathedral demonstrates features that reflect South American Indian roots as much as the Spanish European. Paintings created in the Cusco workshops of European design but people with local Ketchwan features. Foods,",
          "The Cusco cathedral is wonderful as all \u201cPlaza de Armas\u201d. This is a place you can\u2019t miss. Before you go do Machu Pichu stay few days in Cusco and the Sacred Valley.",
          "Also known as the Basilica Cathedral of Cusco, this magnificent edifice dominates the Plaza de Armas (see my review) n the downtown core of Cusco. It was deliberately built by the Spanish on top of the main Incan palace, and used massive stones taken from Sacsayhuaman (see my",
          "We toured the Cathedral with a guide, which I would recommend, it\u2019s a large Cathedral with many interesting art works and engravings, created by locals and incorporating local indigenous culture, a guide will help point these out to you. Loved the Last Super Painting and the",
          "This very large and elaborate church will surely by on your tour. I was iight-headed here as I had not yet adjusted to the altitude. Hard to take it all in.",
          "Most cities in the world have Cathedrals, some better than others, thus us one of the better one\u2019s. It is huge, in 2 sections. It takes awhile to get through it and depending on how much time one has, it is well worth spending some time here.",
          "An amazing display of Catholic Church paraphernalia- my only grumble is that photos are not permitted",
          "Well worth the visit. It is beautiful. I was surprised at how large it was inside. We had a very informative guide Dushka who gave a great insight into the histroy of the Cathedral.",
          "To enter this church they want $50 soles (almost $15 USD) for the two of us. NEVER in Mexico, Colombia, the US, etc. have I encountered this! This is a church! Not a business! There are lots of other things to see in Cusco. Don't waste your money!",
          "Plan to spend at least an hour here to really see the many works of art-- the church is packed with things to see. There are areas where you may and may not take pictures and the guards enforce the rules. I'm glad we had a guide to explain what we were seeing. I'm not sure if",
          "Very nice church.The jesus worn skirt and in black skinned,which you can't see anywhere in the world.Lots of history behind and a guide is needed to get it explained.The last supper painting is fantastic and judas looking at you is different..Lots of beautiful paintings.",
          "We went for the mass on Sunday morning at 8:00am, beautiful service . The Cathedral is inside is huge and beautiful",
          "Although Cusco Cathedral is very beautifully decorated, it did not seem so adorned with gold as those we had seen in Quito. The paintings are magnificent and it is possible to spend as much time there as you wish For a complete experience of how Peru rebuilt after a serious",
          "I was impacted by the collections of religious paintings to admire. Plus you can attend mass. You can spend hours admiring the paintings from centuries past.",
          "Beautiful cathedral lots of highly decorated work in gold, there is a lot to take in. They have a painting of the last supper featuring a guinea pig. You can get an audio guide or pay for a local tour guide. Entry fee was 50 sols (\u00a312).",
          "When staying in Cusco on your Machu Picchu visit, make sure to visit the Cusco Cathedral. To get a real feeling for the Peruvian architecture, the cathedral offers a sense of that \"old world\" feel. Inside is a treasure of rooms and areas and wardrobes that will complete your",
          "Very nice cathedral, this trip is included in our package do we need to go or else we lose our money, but it's nice experience to see beautiful and historic churches",
          "This is not to be missed. The cinnamon Christ had just returned from cleaning when I toured. The silver vs. wood altars are interesting. It's such a sad statement being built on the torn-down Inca edifice and culture.",
          "Spent about an hour at the Cusco Cathedral and loved every minute. Our tour guide offered wonderful information about all the art and different parts of the cathedral. So glad we saw this on our trip to Cusco!",
          "Cusco Cathedral is rich in both beauty and history. The Cusco Cathedral is located on the main square in Cusco. The religious paintings and alters are jaw dropping in their beauty. The cathedral is still used for daily morning mass. The only unfortunate rule is that no photos",
          "It\u2019s a pleasant building, although I\u2019ve seen many much nicer cathedrals and also personally preferred the neighbouring Jesuit Church. It\u2019s expensive for what it is. I lost seventy sols at the entrance. When I realized and went back they were just completely disinterested and",
          "What an incredible church! You can buy tickets right at the entrance. There is so much to see. Get a guide they have all languages available.",
          "Baroque chapels and alters, all with an Andean twist. Fascinating. Then go to the near corner of the square to the most beautiful Starbucks in the world. Weird but true.",
          "I cannot praise this visit high enough. Our tour guide was familiar with all the history and the art. I actually wept at seeing some of the art. A must see of some of the most moving indigenous religious art you will ever have the gift of seeing!",
          "This large cathedral is loaded with artwork - many lovely examples. The resources that went into it are impressive, and makes you wonder about the relationship of the Spanish, the church and the native population.",
          "The Cusco Cathedral was built in the Plaza de Armas. It replaced the Inca temple that the Spanish conquistadores found in that same place, took it down and built a Christian church.The main altar is beautiful all done in silver. The main attraction in the Church is the Black",
          "Alas, you can not take pictures inside this church but I will remember this forever. It not only is a beautiful cathedral with a history that goes back hundreds of years but the restorations that have taken place have not altered the beauty or history. A must see.",
          "This is beautiful inside, worth the ticket price. The main altar is done completely in silver, and there is a painting of the last supper with cuy as the main dish.",
          "You need to see this. The alters are amazing. It is a very large church with two large side chapels. Too bad one can not take photos here.",
          "Stepping inside the cathedral makes you feel like you\u2019ve stepped back in time. The art is amazing and is at a scale that will take your breath away. If you are in Cusco for any time at all- make time for this.",
          "We decided to go to church on the Sunday and it was absolutely stunning inside the cathedral. You are not allowed to take any photos inside but that is understandable. The service was beautiful and we took holy communion which made it even more special for us all.",
          "This is supposed to be a must visit, but if you go, you will have to tell stories about it. The entrance is a bit expensive, and you have to pay for a guide while inside. Invest on a good/certified one. I am Peruvian and know a bit about Pweruvian History and some guides were",
          "The interior of this cathedral is simply stunning; gold and silver adorn all wall hanging paintings, alters, and podiums. And the paintings are spectacular. Unfortunately no photography is allowed.",
          "I don\u2019t have words to describe this wonderfull place, the customs, the people, the food, everything was addorable, Cusco has something that nowhere you can find it ... very soon I will defenetly back to Cusco..",
          "I recommend this church to everyone, but if you have traveled to Europe then you should definitely stop here! Make sure to take note or what makes this one different and unique. Also, while everyone finds the guinea pig (which is actually a chinchilla) last super too be",
          "A lovely cathedral .. so much gold from the ink as while vast poverty left you feeling uneasy. It gives a great history of Catholicism in this area and lovely detail .",
          "I love the last supper painting with the guinea pig as food. It had a beautiful wooden alter which was simply carved but ornate. The ceilings were stunning. No photography is allowed. All the niches were filled with separate alters. Stunning",
          "The Cathedral is an important landmark located in the main square. It is composed of three churches so you get the benefit of visiting three different architecture styles with one single ticket. The audio guide is included in the entrance fee and require your passport as a",
          "It's made up of three chapels/churches/cathedrals blended into one. The first one is ok, the second is awesome, definitely worth a look and the third is tacky and run down. Also, you can't take photos in any of them",
          "this is s massive church so take your time. It would be best to visit with a tour guide to fully understand the blend of Inca and Spanish elements. Very impressive.",
          "We were allowed to enter the cathedral durin a mass. Unfortunately, we don't speak Spanish, so we did not understand much. As we walked around we discovered very interesting painting, for example, the last supper consisting of a guinea pig and Jesus in a lace skirt, something we",
          "The cathedral is part of a package that you can purchase for 30 soles next to the main entrance and you can use a credit card to buy it as well. You are not allowed in when a service is on and the tourist entrance is at the ticket booth. The large doors seem open only with",
          "Did this as part of the half day city tour. It is a must visit with a guide/tour group to really undersatnd the issues regarding the transition from Inca to 'Spanish Catholic.' Places a great deal of your time here in historical perspective and gives a keen insight into the Inca",
          "We had the opportunity to sneak in on a Saturday night wedding. It was just glorious with all the flowers and candles, and chandeliers up the aisle. Just glorious to see and watch.",
          "Interesting place however I wasn\u2019t entirely sure about the history or significance of anything in there at the time (I have since read up on it) as I didn\u2019t hire a guide. I had initially entered partly to have a rest from the hawkers around the plaza. It was very beautiful, and",
          "We went here as part of our half day pre booked tour with our operator. I must admit that our English guide really made the tour and his enthusiasm for each location brought them to life which really added to the experience. I know some people have complained about the price to",
          "This place is so full of bling it's quite disgusting that they charge 25sole each to get in because there is not enough people going to church, so to top up there wealth they charge the tourists. I thought it was over the top & gordy. I'm not religious . It's full of silver &",
          "Of the 38 churches in Cusco, this is the main one so if I only have time to see one, I wanted to see this one. I was very, very disappointed when I paid 25 soles to get in and then realized that I couldn\u2019t take pictures. However, I then realized that an audio tour was included",
          "The exterior appearance of Cusco (Basilica) Cathedral defies what treasures of art, architecture and history lie within its walls. No visit to Cusco would be complete without delving inside to soak up the decorative artwork and architecture. This is not to be missed.",
          "very popular,very crowed, nice view of the balcony,inside very impressive,you must visit when you are in cusco",
          "As others have said, this place is over the top grand. Huge and rambling, it has numerous altars, all of which are fascinating in their own right. Be sure to visit the one dedicated to the \"black Jesus\" (an interesting story!) and the Last Supper which includes some Inca",
          "Beautiful Cathedral and a bit different than the many I've visited over several European countries. I guide is beneficial so help one understand the history of Catholicism in Peru.",
          "Very interesting Cathedral in 3 parts each built at a different time. Many paintings and figures created by the locals with Andean culture represented into Catholicism.",
          "I have visited cathedrals all over the world and this ranks for me as one of the top five! Be sure to use the audio guide that is included in the price of the entrance fee. You need this to truly understand and appreciate all that this HUGE cathedral has to offer. Honestly,",
          "Must see! Of all the churches I have visited all over the world this is the grandest! I lost track of the number of altars- most gilded with 18k or 24k gold and several with panels of hammered silver. We spent almost 3 hrs and left awestruck! Took 100 years to build!",
          "Check out the painting of the Last Supper and the giant silver 'float\". It's worth a visit even it you're not religious.",
          "From out side it looks very modest but interior is lavish. Liberal use of gold and silver to shadow Inca construction was visible. Pay a visit if you\u2019re interested. It comes with multiple options tickets for 130 sols for the Cusco tour. Don\u2019t buy tickets individually.",
          "Just amazing, the paintings, the alters, the vaulted ceilings. This blew me away from the second I walk into it. No Pictures and please remove you hat. It is worth paying extra for guide. Don't skip this!",
          "The church had a black jesus and some interesting depictions of the last supper that had inca influences like baked pig being served. The spanish here leveraged inca beliefs into the church art and in their ceremonies",
          "The Church is a must see! I\u2019ve seen many amazing churches in Europe and the US, and none compare to the opulence and size of this church (except perhaps for the Vatican). Make time to visit this church with a knowledgeable guide.",

          "This is an absolutely beautiful Cathedral. There are actually three churches built within the Cathedral. The intricately carved pulpits, walls, decor etc with gold leaf is incredible. There is one pulpit carved from a single tree, amazing! The Cathedral was part of the overall",
          "We visited the cathedral together with a guide, who could tell the story of the individual alters in the church. The Spanish took most of the gold from the the inka Tempels and used to plate here. It\u2019s amazing to see how the church used inka symbolic to convert them into the",

          "From the very unfriendly staff in the ticket office, to the $25 sol charge, the hard sell of the guides wanting to separate you from another 40 sol - no offer of an audio guide or pamphlet (although I noted the usual numbering system that suggests one was available). There are",
          "This enormous gorgeous Cathedral is filled with wonderful 16th century artwork and sculptures. One of the early Bishops was an owner of a silver mine and the silver in this Cathedral is extensive and fantastic. I\u2019ve never seen more beautiful silver work in one place!",
          "They charge s/ 30 for entrance and it is on top of the general access ticket (s/ 130) that I have purchased for my visit to cusco. However, some of the paintings are worth the visit.",
          "There is so much history in here that you will miss most of it without a guide. They hang around the front entry and are all self-employed so to speak. We had a good one and it made our visit all the more worth while.",
          "Cathedrals all tend to look alike but this one is pretty nice inside and I would say a \"must see\" while in Cusco--both for the history and for its beauty. You don't need a lot of time, but nice to check it all out and of course, see the famous Last Supper painting! You can",
          "The price to visit the catedral and the 2 churches that are part of the place was 25 soles peruanos. Inside the church there were a few guides that approached to guide a tour inside the church (for 4 people it was 50 soles peruanos). The guide Juan was great and we learned a",
          "Incredible history and detailed art / decor. Definitely worth a visit - better than many historical cathedrals you'll see across Europe.",

          "I also visited the cathedral of the city which was very beautiful with many interesting paintings from the XVI and XVII century",
          "I don\u2019t understand why but I love visiting churches. The history, the art, the work that is put into these places is incredible. I have to say that this church, cathedral took my breath away. The paintings and statues were very different from other churches. Would have been nice",
          "The Altar is one of the best 3 I've seen (and I'm certainly not religious). There's \"NO PHOTOS\" signs everywhere. Why not \"NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY\" and give people a memorable souvenir? Art Is good and interesting",
          "This massive, massive Cathedral with its displayes in pure silver and its huge oil paintings as well as its different halls and colors has to be seen to be believed. Even people who don't go to church every Sunday should give this one a try. It is one of the most spectacular",
          "A local tour guide inside the church convinced us on a guided tour for 20 soles so we could appreciate the art and decor and it paid off. We were short on time so we saw most of the exhibits in 20 minutes with a guide. The guide expanded layout design to symbolism the cross and",
          "This was fun to see, and we just walked around and read the plaques on our own. It didn't necessarily seem like having a guide would get you significantly more value. When you enter, several guides were pretty pushy about having a guided tour of the cathedral, which was weird to",
          "A very interesting cathedral. The mixing of the local and Spanish cultures in the art provides a good insight into the history of Cusco. Look out for the guinea pig dinner in the last supper.",

          "I am not a person that gets a lot of satisfaction from visiting old churches. This was on our city tour of Cusco and I was truly amazed at the church. This is one church I would go back to visit. I was so awe struck that my neck hurt from looking up at all the art on the",
          "Here you\u2019ll see the cross between Spanish Catholicism and Peruvian beliefs. There\u2019s even a genea pig for the last supper! Lots of gold and statues. Doesn\u2019t take too long. Worth a look at the difference between this and European cathedrals.",
          "It\u2019s three monstrosities of Catholic Spain. They were built will rocks hauled down from Saqsaywaman, which was a massive holy site of the Inka and Quechua; thanks to its enormous rocks the Spanish didn\u2019t manage to destroy it all. Like many Catholic edifices, these 3 churches are",
          "I was very impressed with this cathedral. From outside it does not impress but has really a beautiful interior. There are several rooms and many side Rooms, all different with nice altars etc. One of the most impressive cathedrals I have seen, I highly recommend to visit when in",
          "A fascinating cathedral, with a blend of Catholic and Inca culture. This is epitomised by the Last Supper painting, which shows Andean food, including cuy (roast guinea pig), and a 'Judas' who was apparently the spitting image of Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador.",

          "I almost didn't go, it costs 25 sol (7 USD) and I am not a fan of colonial South American religious art (I've seen enough by now). But it is huge and worth it, 3 churches in one, among the best of baroque, syncretism all over paintings and decorations.",

          "The largest and most important cathedral in Cusco. Very interesting to see how the Incan people incorporated their own beliefs into the local Catholic cathedral. One of the highlights is the painting of the \u201cLast Supper\u201d - the main dish is Cuy (guinea pig). Massive silver and",

          "This super opulent church is a disgrace to the Christian faith. Sure it's full of gold and marble statues but Jesus wouldn't approve of charging money to go into a 'supposed' place of worship. I do not support this and it makes me sad to see so much wealth inside this Cathedral",
          "The cathedral is huge and impressive. Inside there are wonderfully ornate altars in silver and gold. The paintings are also worth seeing. It is disappointing that you can\u2019t take photos especially as the entrance fee is quite large. We later visited a church where a CD was given",

          "We love visiting old churches and cathedrals but really didn't expect anything of this magnitude here in Cusco. It was simply enormous, packed wall-to-wall with beautiful artwork and historic treasures. We were on the official City Tour and the guide did a nice job of explaining",
          "Like many cities, particularly in South America where a high percentage of the population is Catholic, Cusco has a large Cathedral centrally located - adjacent to the large Plaza de Armas. It's a nice area to visit - the square and the imposing Cathedral overlooking it.",
          "Sometimes a cathedral is just a cathedral. This place is more than just that. We had a great tour guide, which made all the difference. There is an old part that dates back to the 1500s and the \u2018new\u2019 part that has 12 separate chapels. There are so many interesting tidbits it is",
          "When you see the Cathedral from the outside, you can't imagine what awaits you on the inside. The gold altars, the high ceilings and the naves are impressive, like a cathedral you would find in Europe. Pictures are not allowed inside. One of the highlights of my trip to Cusco.",
          "Besides the dramatic colonial exterior, the interior is even more dramatic with extensive ornamentation, gold baroque and neoclassical designs, colonial era Spanish paintings, and an immense interior to support the dramatic elements. Truly a must to enter into during your visit",
          "This church is like many Catholic churches around the world. They were preparing for Easter so it was congested. I have been to the gothic church in Sevilla in Spain. This church was a small version with many rooms designated for specific religious ceremonies. The outside is",
          "Very interesting place, we paid 25sol each for admission and another 30sol for guided tour, this was a good investment as our guide gave us in-depth knowledge of the cathedral and local area, your not allowed to take any images.",
          "Was able to visit for Palm Sunday. There are a number of services per day. Try to get to an early one (the first one is in an Indain language not Spanish!) to avoid paying the 20sol gringo fee they change tourist to enter later in the day...",
          "Great place to visit with a lot of art, history and arquitecture. The ticket includes a very good audio guide in English or Spanish.",
          "Stunning inside and out. Our guide did a great job giving us details about all three altars. So much to absorb and see while you are there. Would put this toward the top of things to see if you are in Cusco.",
          "We've certainly visited a lot of cathedrals. What distinguishes this one is all the art from the Cusco School. Plus it's neat to be in a place in the western hemisphere that dates from the 1560s. There's an admission fee of 25 soles and was chose to pay a guide to tell us what",
          "If you go here during Semana Santa (Easter week) you will see the Catedral being decorated with flower arrangments and the believes gathering for the procession. Pay attention to the painting of the Last Supper, as you will discover its local flavour. :)",
          "You can walk (quietly) among the Inca of today and witness their upturned faces riveted to the service in Spanish and you can enjoy the sermon if your Spanish is good enough. The famous \"Last Supper\" I finally found -- after looking at every painting in the Cathedral -- and it",
          "Gold and cedar wood make up the architecture of this beautiful cathedral. The gold altars were simply astounding and The Last Supper painting had cuy (guinea pig) on the plate!!! Overall, 10/10! 100% would recommend!!!",
          "Interesting glimpse into the history of the Spanish conquest and the contributions of the Incas to the arts. Typical Spanish religious art is, however, injected with the interpretation in certain respects of the local artists and their views. Suggest to take a guided tour to",
          "Truly amazing cathedral . So much to see. Look for all the Incan symbols incorporated into the Spanish style. A very beautiful church.",
          "The crown jewel of plaza de armas. Definitely worth a visit to check out the multiple altars and art work. Price per person is s/25 per person. However, if you stop by during mass time entrance is free. Having said that, if in the church during mass there will be church staff",
          "I have traveled all over the world and seen many Catholic Cathedrals. This might not be as nicely finished as say, Notre Dame, but it is very large and beautiful. Many alters and side rooms with wonderful religious art and carvings. Well worth seeing.",
          "Well worth a trip through this church to see how the traditional views of Christianity have merged with South American culture. Be respectful in your clothing choice and you will really enjoy this.",
          "This Cathedral is well worth a visit to see both the wanton destruction of sacred inca sites in the stones from which it was built, and the gold and silver that once adorned those sites now displayed in gaudy splendour. The paintings by local artists of familia bibical scenes",

          "This is 3 churches in one, each with their own identities. The artwork is outstanding, more along the lines of an art museum than a church. Mind boggling detail on the alters. Pity no pictures. When you buy your tickets it\u2019s possible to get one for several sites including the",
          "this cathedral that as built 1654 is really is a must see. It's a UNESCO World Heritage sight. The interior if shaped like a Latin Cross and holds many archeological artifacts and relics. Our tour ended with the painting of the Last Supper that was simply hilarious. In the",
          "This is a 3 in 1 Cathedral with 1 church on each side of the Cathedral. The first church at the entrance is quite nice, with old altars and some nice paintings. But its not until you enter the Cathedral in the middle your jaw drops. With enormous pillars and beautiful details",

          "This is a MUST do while I\u2019m Cusco. The cathedral contains like 2 mini churches, 1 main church and from what i remember like 40 alters. The architecture and time put into this cathedral is just amazing. Our guide told us it took 96 years to build the main room. So much",

          "It was pretty impressive as most old cathedrals are with some really nice old paintings and a small tomb (maybe 8 places in it). The painting were interesting- had guinea pigs etc. The only thing is unless you knew what you were looking at, you might be a bit lost- the signs",
          "\u201eLa Catedral\u201c of Cusco is one of the most impressive cathedrals I have ever seen. We went to visit the cathedral in the early morning hours when the main square and the cathedral were still in silence and no one around - it was simply breathtaking and beautiful. I think they",

          "Quite simply the architecture, history and everything surrounding this area is a must see, a guide is essential, small entrance fee payable.",
          "We visited the Cathedral de Cusco in early December, 2017. It's a must see in Cusco, a great example of Spanish conquistador architecture. I was dismayed that our guide told us the patron saint of Italy is St, Francis of Assisi, when it is in fact St Joseph. I was surprised to",

          "This is a very cool catedral. Very, very ornate. It's not expensive to visit. I also recommend hiring a guide when you are in the catedral. They're not expensive and they tell you about the altars as they are all very different and represent different things. We couldn't take",
          "A private tour is offered and worth $10 USD or so to learn more about the structure and art contained inside. Sonya was my guide and did a great job! Throughout the inside, you can see the influences (symbols, food and customs) of the local artists that were (no doubt)",

          "They charge you for every church you would like to visit, sad!. It costs 10 dollar visit!, too much!",
          "... that's reason enough to go! There is not photography, even without flash, so be prepared for that. But is fun to see the painting of last supper with a poor little guinea pig as the main dish.",
          "So beautiful and historic. It watches over the entire centre and with good reason. Built in the 1600\u2019s and still in immaculate condition!",
          "We really enjoyed this tour. We were a small group our lady guide, Edith, was very knowledgeable and polite.",
          "From the outside, would have thought to go into the Cathedral but it was part of a tour we did a couple of days later. The inside is incredible with original arts, unique altars made from Silver and Limestone. There are three churches in one here with each one quite different."

        "wiki": "The Museo de Arte Precolombino (also known by its acronym MAP; in English: Pre-Columbian Art Museum) is an art museum in Cusco, Peru, dedicated to the display of archaeological artifacts and examples of pre-Columbian artworks drawn from all regions of pre-Columbian Peru. The museum is situated on Plaza Nazarenas in Cusco's San Blas district, and has on permanent display exhibitions of some 450 individual representative artifacts that are drawn from the wider collection of its parent museum, the Larco Museum in the Peruvian capital Lima.\n\n\n== History of the building ==\n\nThe building where the museum is now housed was originally an Inca ceremonial courthouse. In 1580, it was acquired by the conquistador Alonso D\u00edaz and subsequently built over in Colonial style to become the home of an elite member of Cusco society, the Viceroy Hernandez de Cabrera, for whom the mansion is named. It then passed through many hands and had multiple functions, ultimately falling into a ruinous state. After a restoration by the Fundaci\u00f3n BBVA, the Museo de Arte Precolombino re-opened in June 2003.Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo inaugurated the museum at the summit, saying \"we are showing the world our cultural wealth. I am profoundly proud that [we can give to the summit] a little of the culture that belongs not only to Peru, but also to Latin America\u2026 [The region must] look to its past to construct together a new Latin America with more health, education, justice for the poor and culture.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nThe works of art displayed at the museum, encompass a period of time ranging between 1250 BC and  AD 1532. There are a total of ten galleries: Formative, Nasca, Mochica, Huari, Chancay \u2013 Chimu, Inca, Wood, Jewelry and Stone, Silver, and Gold and Metals.\nThe Formative Gallery houses pieces from many diverse cultures. Among these are Cupisnique, Salinar, Vicus, Viru and Paracas in its older phase or \u201ccavernas\u201d. During this period (1250 B. C - 1 A. D.) there is a remarkable advance in ceramic art. Painting and sculpture take in place; there are beautifully naturalistic and symbolic representations; many of them enriched by the use of incise decoration in which the Cupisnique artist get to a high development.\nThe Inca culture conquered all the territory of pre-Columbian Peru where they restored with great political ability the Tahuantinsuyo empire. In the Inca Gallery magnificent ceramic objects are showcased like the emblematic aribalos or monumental vessels. These pieces have many decorative elements that transmit a subtle message of organization and symbolism. One of these aribalos is of great size and is unique to the collection.\n\n\n== Other points of interest ==\nThe Museum's Auditorium seats 120 people and often houses lectures and other local events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseo de Arte Italiano\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino | Map Cusco, official website (in Spanish and English)",

          "This museum will take you less than an hour and you will walk out with a greater understanding of everything you see in Cuzco. It begins with a 10 minute video, which gives you a very clear picture of the way the people of Cuzco and Peru conceived of the world around them as",

          "We enjoyed visiting this museum after exploring the Inca sites of the Sacred Valley, and being able to see all of the influences they drew upon. Wonderful little museum that inspires me to visit the coastal cultures on our next trip to Peru.",
          "Yes, this is a small museum but packed with information essential to those who want to know the background of the region. The displays are worthy of any metropolitan museum. Photos with no flash are permitted. You will be glad you came here! Great local food restaurant right",

          "A must see!!! Interactive, well organized and informative. The personal recorded audio helped a lot specifically with the kids. The artifacts are well displayed and magnificent. If you are staying in Cusco and don\u2019t have much time this museum should be on top of your list. The",
          "If you have little time in Cusco, this museum is a must. Is small enough to visit it rapidly and in the same time it treasures the essential of the pre-colombian art, leaving you with the right amount of information needed to explore the rest of the historical sites with a",
          "We went to a lot of Precolumbian museums and liked this as one of the more interesting and well laid out. The museum provided good historical context, but focused more on the objects as artwork and as examples of craftsmanship which was a bit of a welcome change. Many of the",

          "Allow about an hour to peruse the exhibit here. We thought it was just the right amount of pottery, sculpture, and jewelry to give us a feel for the range of styles that emerged from the various cultures that inhabited Peru (the most prominent include Nazca, Moche, Chimu, Lima",
          "Quiet,small museum reasonably priced at 10 soles/person. Nice retreat from bustle of Cuzco. Map restaurant had nice selection for lunch and quality food. A bit of a climb to reach from town center but worth the trip. We took taxi and walked down from the art district. Taxis",

          "This is one of the best small museums I've visited in recent years. It's a well-curated selection of Pre-Columbian art including Pre-Incan and Incan objects organized thematically by wood, silver, gold, ceramics, etc. The rooms are kept purposely dark with strong backlighting on",
          "We happened to be in Cusco before we were in Lima due to a flight delay. Our guide suggested we visit this Museo before going to Machu Picchu. She was right to do so. However, once we saw the Museo Larco in Lima, this one was (as expected) quite a lot smaller. It did have",
          "Well worth a visit. Easy to get to, in the middle of Cusco. The audio guide is well worth the purchase. The relics are amazing and in excellent condition considering their age. I did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked lovely and I heard it was excellent.",

          "A perfect pairing for a day is to walk through Sacsayhuaman with a guide to get an introduction to Inka culture, history, and archeology, then hed to this Museum. Unlike the Museo Inka around the corner, this museum is fantastic. It is not overwhelming (important if you are",
          "We went here because we had a few hours pre-flight. Nice selection of mostly pre-Incan artifacts. Small museum and a bit of a tourist attraction but informative, the Incas were, oddly, latecomers to this region.",

          "Definitely worth a visit. Masterfully exhibited artifacts from different cultures that lived all over Peru.",
          "This is a very nice museum to learn more about the culture and history of the Inca culture in Peru. Very fine exhibits explaining how the area evolved before the large Inka empire was created leading to the building of Machu Picchu. Artifacts on display are very well presented",

          "It is a small, well-curated museum set up for the specific purpose of showcasing pre-Inca artwork. For someone who has studied so much about the Inca civilization, it came as a surprise that this art, predating the Incas, was so elegant and, to some degree, stylized. There",
          "The artifacts are superb... the very best of the nearly made the grade stuff from the Larco collection in Lime. However the interpretation is a mixture of interesting, superficial and somebody endelessly repeting the same thought as they wing'd it through their consultancy.",

          "Why is that tours generally seem to home in on temples and churches depending on the country you're visiting and play down museums and art galleries? It's like you have to visit at least one a day. Fortunately with 'free' time in Cusco there was time to visit the Pre-Colombian",
          "One of the best museums I've been to- period. Definitely the best in Cusco in my opinion. All of the items had well written descriptions (English), excellent presentation and lighting, and they do allow photography. I spent far more time here than I planned, and I'm glad I did.",
          "This was my favorite museum in Cusco. They have the pottery broken out by the different groups so you could clearly see the different styles between the groups. It seemed like one room for each group. The quality of the pottery was the best that I saw on my trip.",
          "This museum is realtively small, but has quite a lot squeezed in, it's well curated with plenty of descriptive information for the items, sometimes with amusing translations. The building itself is beautiful. If you are looking for something interesting to do in Cusco, this is",
          "I went here to kill time in Cusco and it was interesting. I am more interested in anthropology than art specifically, but find that some art museums can give you a good idea of the development and connections between peoples of the area and world which i think this museum does.",
          "Displays are arranged into 12 rooms, about the first 8 devoted to pottery and wood carvings, most of which we absolutely loved. Such beautiful pieces! Each description is reverently worded in good English, and though sometimes a bit over the top, provided good information. The",

          "Wandered in and had lovely quiet patio lunch, museum is interesting, but small quiet lunch w white tablecloths was the bomb.....recommend it!",
          "The museum has some nice stuff but the descriptions are very odd and don't tell you where the artifact came from. I put this down to the fact that most of the artifacts were probably originally looted from tombs and so they really have no idea where they were found.",
          "This museum has a very good collection of objects from pre-Incan and Incan cultures. The art itself is beautiful, and we appreciated that the signs were multilingual. However the descriptions were more pretentious art criticism than information about the objects, the cultures",
          "Lovely pieces on exhibit, but the small size of its collection prevents this museum from getting more than a 4 from me. The entire museum can be properly visited in under an hour.",

          "It took me two hours to see the entire museum, reading all the descriptions and seeing all the items...TWICE. If you're just passing by and taking a look at the most impressive items, it will take you no more than 30-45 minutes to check the whole collection. It's open till late",
          "I think the people writing these glowing reviews must have gone to a different museum. This museum has 12 rooms with just a handful of pieces in each room. I'd be surprised if it takes even the most avid art lover more than an hour. The descriptions of the objects were by far",

          "This is a small museum with an amazing restaurant in the courtyard. It is in collaboration with the Museo Larco in Lima and the relationship is obvious. A nice capture of the history of the area",
          "The descriptions of the artifacts were \"flowery\" and much more like an art show than a museum. I was disappointed in this museum and I wouldn't have missed anything if I had not have visited it. The restaurant there, I am told, is quite nice and was a nice venue but I did not",
          "Our tour guide, Edgar from Inkayni, provided a guided tour of this museum which was fascinating. After seeing the exhibits of show we then went onto to visit many of the sites in the museum.",
          "The building itself is beautiful and the artwork is very nicely displayed. There are captions to all the pieces in several languages though they are sometimes written in a pretentious fashion. This is an extension of the fantastic Larco Museum in Lima. Well worth a visit.",

          "This museum just reached me in a way that the others didn't. The presentation of the pieces was sensitive, and meaningful.....and here I think particularly of the wooden carvings. The 3000 year old pottery also blew me away, and I enjoyed the descriptions in English. I preferred",
          "This museum had a nicely curated collection of gorgeous pieces. I enjoyed that they had it displayed by time period and area, so that I could learn about the different techniques and how they evolved over time. I would highly recommend this museum.",
          "This museum is connected to the Larco Museum in Lima and has an excellent, but small collection. Also has an outlet and demonstration of the Centro Textil in the courtyard. Well worth a visit.",
          "Of the multiple museums I visited while in Cusco, this was by far the best and if you only have time for one, I would definitely recommend focusing on this place first and foremost. The collection isn't large, but it is uniformly excellent - with each piece seemingly curated to",
          "Excellent collection, wonderfully curated and displayed. A total joy to visit. Photography is allowed, which was great because this is probably one of the best collections of Peruvian pre-Columbian art in the world.",
          "Perhaps the best museum in Cuzco: remarkable collection, well laid out with original and helpful explanations in three languages for each piece. They also make a strong argument for primitive art with reflections by notable artists posted throughout the complex. Only",
          "We were not able to see the Inca Museum as this is closed on Sunday so we settled for the Pre-Columbian Art Museum. I'm sure that the collection is very comprehensive, but we were not really able to gather any facts at all about the artefacts due to the descriptions. They",
          "Although the Inca Museum and Machu Picchu Museum are \"must sees\" prior to heading off to the Sacred Valley, this Museum is in fact the best of all of them. It is well presented and the descriptions of the objects are informative (if expressed in perhaps over artistic language",

          "Admission is 20 sol for adults, 10 sol for students. There's no walking or audio tour. There are only about 8-9 rooms with a handful of items each. I love antiquity museums, but this one I could have skipped.",
          "Read about this from a review and they were spot on. A gem of a museum with 11 wonderfully curated rooms, informative descriptions and some absolutely spectacular early works. Stone,ceramic,wood,shell,silver and gold pieces are represented.Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",
          "I found it the most outstanding museum. The collection is exquisite and explanations are very interesting and unusual. The curators put a lot of stress on the artistic expression and the meaning of artifacts. The museum is open til 10 p.m and it was very pleasant to spend 2.5",
          "A great building and and even greater contents. The descriptions were in also written by in English and were very informative. Please visit this museum which also has a well regarded restaurant.",
          "I was impressed by the artwork here. There are signs in Spanish and English and some of the artifacts were very impressive. And since it isn't included on the general tourist ticket, it's a little less crowded, which was a nice bonus. I enjoyed it.",
          "I really enjoyed this small museum that provided a summary of a lot of exhibits I had visited all over Peru. If you don't have time to visit much more than Cusco, this is a great way to learn about Peruvian history. Simple exhibits moved you right along and kept it interesting",
          "This is a very nice museum in downtown Cusco just a few minutes walk from the Plaza de Armas. It is in an older building that has a traditional design built around an open courtyard. The exhibitions are in separate rooms on two floors. Admisssion is 20 soles. There are",
          "Affiliated with the Larco Museum of Lima, this museo is similarly organized according to era and culture. Featured pieces provide an overview of Pre-Columbian cultures' artistic styles and locations within the empire. Neither large nor extensive but worth a visit.",
          "This is a small museum but the variety of artifacts make it worth the trip. We loved the ceramic and metal collections. The descriptions are all written in English, which was nice, but the information on each placard is poorly written and mostly filled with over-the-top",
          "Enough sheer beauty and skill to be seen in this museum to bring tears to the eyes. It's not overstuffed with average pieces, each item is properly and carefully displayed, and of outstanding artistic value. My only complaint is the lack of information in the labelling of",

          "We all 4 were bowled over by the collection. The art is surprisingly complex and beautiful, and the galleries are way nicer than the Inka museum on the plaza de Armas. My only complaint is that the museum doesn't have a collection book, but you can buy the Lorca book, which has",
          "A nice, although smaller, museum full of pre-columbian artifacts and interesting information about the incas. The kids will love to see the sacrificial artifacts and read the stories that accompany them. A beautiful display of gold and silver artificats and many ceramics.",
          "I went to this museum and i don't regret the 20 soles(entrance fee). It's a bit small but if you visit Cusco it's one of the things you should see. It is located in a small square. If you are in a hurry you can spend 30 min to an hour there. It's close to the Plaza de Armas.",
          "This is where the first I heard of \"primitive design\", allusion occurred in my mind with Flemish primitivists in painting. I knew I loved all this approaches to strict lined paintings but here observing hundreds of objects it is systemized in your min map in to sort of cultural",

          "We loved seeing the artifacts but would have enjoyed it more if they had given more info about where they were found & better info on the items. Too many quotes from contemporary artists, comparisons to the likes of Picaso were not appropriate and the information felt like the",
          "There's a lot to see in Cuzco and the surrounding area, but if you can only visit one museum, this is the one (and much more interesting than the Inca Museum). There are several rooms on two floors - the pottery and gold are superb. There's also a great restaurant attached to",
          "Having spent the previous four days in and about Cusco taking in a variety of tours, we had a day to spend visiting museums. We're glad we visited here. It was 20 soles per person. We were practically alone. And it's not far from the main plaza in Cusco.",
          "We visited the Museum on our last day in Cusco (just across the square from our hotel, the Belmond Monasterio) and were pleasantly surprised. A collection of really exquisite pieces that provide a glimpse of what the Inkas and the pre Inka civilizations were able to produce.",
          "The museum is very centrally located and easy to find, it occupies the space next to the Belmond Hotel Cuzco, and hosts pre-Inca artifacts (pottery mostly), from Chimu, Nazca and other cultures. It also has Inca artefacts, creating a very nice visual timeline of the pre-Empire",
          "This was a terrific follow up to the Museo Larco in Lima with its stunning ceramics collection. Don't miss the shell collection; it is stunning. The gift shop offers the stellar weaving products from Nilda's textile workshop in Chincero, and women demonstrate weaving in the",
          "This museum has wide art collection from 1000BC to 16th century (before Spanish conquest). I was truly impressed by rich civilization and brilliant artifact made by Amerindians. They varied from seashell necklace to highly sophisticated gold/silver decorations and potteries.",
          "This museum provided a good selection of Pre-Columbian objects. All information was provided in both Spanish and English.",
          "This is a must see! A hidden gem of a museum, 2 floors of amazing artefacts and beautiful Inca pieces. Highly recommend a visit here. There's also a lively glass aircon bistro/cafe in the courtyard if you wish to get ouf of the heat.",
          "it's a good museum but with no new things to see if you have been to other museums, if you have a limited time you can totally compromise it.",
          "Nice little museum, small but outstanding collection from several pre-Colombian cultures, heavy on ceramics. Be sure to read the labels, they are informative and poetic.",
          "We stopped here since we had an afternoon to kill before our departure flight from Cusco. It took about and hour to hour and a half to get through the museum while reading all of the info provided in each exhibit. They have a lot of Inca treasures here and it was fun to learn",
          "This museum was about a block from my hotel and it's just the right size for exploring. The pieces are well displayed and marked, although a bit too dim in some places making it difficult to read but highly recommended to get an overview of pre-incan art. It's not overwhelming",
          "We walked from the Plaza de Armas up to this lovely museum set on a typical hispanic square surrounded bt restaurants and a beautiful old hotel. The exhibits are well set out and we shared the building with just one other couple so we had time to study the exhibits in detail. A",
          "This is a private museum, with a lovely collection of thoughtfully displayed and explained pieces of pottery, carvings and jewellery. The museum is housed in a restored heritage building on a small plaza, just one block up the hill from the Plaza de Armas. The exhibits are",
          "This is a well put together display of pre columbian art. They have signs in English. It's self guided. It was nice to learn about life before the Incas. It is open on Sunday.",
          "We chose this museum because another we had intended to visit was shut on a Sunday. We were very pleasantly surprised! What fascinated me about the artifacts in the MAP Museum was that they were so beautiful. I expected only utilitarian objects. These were works of art (in",
          "Stunning displays, especially lovely relative to other city museums. Beautiful old building that has been meticulously crafted to showcase exquisite artifacts. Small but worth a visit.",
          "The art works are housed in a pleasant colonial building in a quiet little plaza just set back from the main Plaza De Armas. All easily found on foot. The collection is a nice size for people who are not able to spend hours in museums. Any craft potters visiting Peru would find",
          "The Pre-Columbian Art Museum has a bias, that these are early works of art and not just artifacts for a cultural or regional museum. I appreciate that the museum is open later in the evening so you can go after dinner. The displays are well lit and well marked although with",
          "As we had a morning to fill we went into this museum by chance and nearly didn't bother, that would have been a great mistake as the exhibits are fantastic. They are too varied to list but some of the ornamental jewelry is exquisite",
          "We had dinner at the MAP restaurant, wonderful food and atmosphere. Highly recommend this experience.",
          "This museum is beautifully laid out, and is a good taster if you are thinking of going to a more extensive museum in Lima. The gold, silver, and wooden statues are a real insight into the amazing Inca culture. Definitely worth a visit, and you can do it justice in an hour. If",
          "Some fantastic exhibits but they keep all the rooms very dark so quite difficult to see what it says about what you are looking at! Amazing silver and gold exhibits",
          "Nice to visit a smaller museum, especially when the altitude is weighting heavily on you. Did not appreciate being charged more as a tourist than the local people, but I really wanted to see it, so ended up paying the double rate. It was worth it.",
          "We decided to visit this small museum and were very glad we did. The collection encompasses 12 room, artifacts are quite amazing and well displayed. They also have a lovely dining space in the courtyard where we stopped for a snack and once again we're glad we did.",
          "Great museum to visit, specially if you\u00b4ve been or is planning to visit the Larco Museum in Lima on the same trip. It has different exhibitions of different artifacts of previous civilizations of the region. I would not recommend for kids, since it won\u00b4t be quite entertaining",
          "this building holds some of the gems of the land. there are fantastic pieces, nicely organised and its not enormous so you can do it in an hour and a bit if you are like me. def say that its worth visiting, very quiet, hardly anyone there so you can take your time without",
          "Great look at artisans before the Inca, especially if you missed the Larco Museum in Lima. Nazca plates and vases. Moche shellwork. All intricate. Pieces are well-displayed and galleries are few. It's easy to glean a lot in a short time.",
          "This museum is exquisite. The collection is impressive, but not overwhelming. The written descriptions are really wonderful, and available in multiple languages. This is a must for art lovers.",
          "Really beautiful artwork and pieces of ancient tools, pottery, and artwork. One one negative is the focus on how the objects were made and the quality of the artwork and no real information on the importance or use of the objects in day to day life. Worth a tour.",
          "Definitely worth visiting. Beautifully arranged and small enough that the whole family will enjoy without getting tired or bored.",
          "This museum is an adjunct of the Larco Museum in Peru. It has a small portion of the Larco collection but the exhibits are smaller and more defined in scope. You can walk through the two floors of the museum and see a wide range of articles including textiles as well as pottery.",
          "The museum is just a block away from the Plaza de Armas and is only 10 soles per person to get in. We really enjoyed it, the pottery is so interesting and there were so many unique Incan items on display. Highly recommend.",
          "A quick walk from the Plaza de Armas, this museum is worth an hour walk through the 2 floors. It houses paintings, artifacts, jewelry and pottery in a easy laid out design. It also has a few gift shops, one which has Pablo Seminario creations, if you missed his workshop in",
          "This is not a big museum but with a rather good collection. The best part of our experience was that it was not crowded at all. There were less than 10 people in the whole place when we were visiting. It also has a very good, but not inexpensive restaurant in the court yard.",
          "Although the museum most likely had several interesting objects on display, this didn't catch our interest much since the presentation of the objects was so poor. It was like the museums used to be some 50 years ago. And most likely nothing has changed here during this period.",
          "It was definitely worth a visit to this small but impressive museum. I went on a Saturday and I was the only visitor. Entry fee was 20 soles. The rooms were spacious and the displays were well-laid out on two floors. There is a line on the floor that you follow to see the",
          "This is a great visit for the beginning of a trip to Peru. It's a relatively small museum located close to the Plaza de Armas. For 15 soles, you can visit. There's a nice selection of objects from the Incan empire but also from the civilizations predating them. It's nice to see",
          "This museum houses some great art and culture from various periods in Peru. The museum is very well presented and pleasant on a sunny day.",
          "This was a very nice collection of art/artifacts. Plan on about an hour and a half to two hours to take it in.",
          "The museum collection provided a great overview to pre-Columbian art of the region\u2013\u2013there are really some amazing works. Entry 20 soles though they have a student discount.",
          "This is not really an archeological museum. Instead it asks you to appreciate the formal beauty of the amazing objects (jewelry, ceramics, etc.) in the collection. Go at night, it's open late!",
          "This in worth seeing if you are inCusco. it gives you and idea of some of the local art in the area. it is not far from the square.",
          "We were very impressed with the expertise evidenced by the pieces of mostly utilitarian ware. Two excellent small shops within the museum, including Sanitario.",
          "We have bought a stone bird at a small shop in the museum. The artist explains several types of pottery. He shows how to play it. Dogs and bird sounds are amazing. He has copies of antique pots and you get a certificate. It is a valuable. Also the colection gives a very good",
          "The building is a nice historical building and the museum is very well taken care of. beautiful jewellery exhibition and it looked like the restaurant was very good as well.",
          "Loved it. Although smaller than many museums, the pieces are extraordinary and are very well displayed. The detail and craftsmanship of many of the artifacts are exceptional. It is a self guided tour (follow the arrows so not to miss any exhibits) that can be easily done in one",
          "Superb collection of beautiful pottery from long ago. Well presented and explained. Fine restaurant in the courtyard.",
          "This museum, while small, has an excellent series of exhibits on pre-Columbian art including ceramics, seashells, and metal work. I was impressed by the quality of the exhibits and really enjoyed seeing the great craftsmanship on display. Definitely worth an hour to explore,",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. It's small enough to visit in about an hour, and contains tons of interesting art that's organized by material (metal, wood, etc) and region. They had nice bathrooms, too.",
          "I couldn't believe some of the pottery they had here. I was beginning to wonder if many of these pieces were reproductions because they were in such good shape! In any case, a good place to spend an hour or so.",
          "And enjoy seeing pre-Columbian art, this is a great museum. Worth an hour visit, especially if you would like to slow the pace of a frantic Peru trip.",
          "A quick walk uphill from the Plaza de Armas, this museum offers some beautiful pottery from the cultures before the Incas, and those that later comprised the Inca empire. It is definitely worth a visit for anyone visiting Cusco who is interested in ancient cultures and art.",
          "The museum has some great artifacts and a lot of interesting information - I'm really glad I went - but in some cases the displays were coming apart a bit, or could have used a bit better materials in the first place. I gave them a donation but it would be great if they could",
          "Old intact artifacts from before Christopher Columbus arrived. I believe most of the collection was bought from tomb raiders. I would recommend a visit if you have extra time or are really into ancient artifacts. The paintings of Jesus in Incan garb was neat to see.",
          "If you want to see pre-Columbian artifacts, visit this place over the Museo Inka. The display and interpretation here far exceeds that of the Museo Inka, which has very antiquated displays, though admittedly some interesting objects.",
          "I was very impressed by this small museum in Cusco. What a beautiful collection of pre-Columbian art. Nicely displayed in a gorgeous old building with detailed descriptions for each piece, and a series of interesting quotations from famous artist about primitive art. I love that",
          "we were happy to be here visiting one of the most famed museums in town, looks like a open book in history could tell us something.",
          "It is located in a very beautiful colonial building. It exhibits interesting masterpieces of art from all Peru. There are signs in English, Spanish and French but do not expect a wide variety. Less than an hour is enough to visit it thorougly. The entrance fee is 20/10 soles per",
          "Good stop for a rainy or extremely hot day So much to see here and there was a local artist on sight to chat with",
          "This was a private collection and there are some side rooms with various pieces of art displayed, I think the descriptions are in Spanish only (can't recall now). It's nice for killing time while you are waiting for the MAP Cafe to open, but didn't really appeal to us. Maybe if",
          "Though it is very small, they do display things beautifully and I found it very interesting and beautiful.",
          "The artifacts were incredible. The museum stayed open rather late which was very nice and allowed ample time to view the whole collection.",
          "Well-curated collection of indigenous ceramics, artifacts and colonial era religious paintings in a lovely old convent. Especially good if you need a place to while away the time if it rains.",
          "An elegant and excellent museum that displays the remarkable beauty and sophistication of so called \"primitive\" art in Peru before the conquest. It also explains the complexity of the societies that we summarise wrongly under the rubric \"Inca\"",
          "at 10 soles for a student ticket, you can get a good introduction to a history of Inca and Pre-Inca art including ceramics, metal work and wood work. While small, especially as the textiles area was closed when i went, the pieces are still excellently presented and highlight",
          "I had some time to spend and the entrance fee was relatively inexpensive and I wanted to at least take a look. I'm not much of an art-lover, but the exhibitions were nice. The flow of the museum was a bit confusing, but I soon figured it out. Enjoyed my stroll through the",
          "Not as big as the Larco Museum in Lima ( they are related) , nevertheless it is laid out with such care and love for history, beauty and art of this country. You canot but admire the thought that went into displaying the treasures in such a way that they make the greatest",
          "This is a must see if you are a bit interested in Pre-Columbian Art. The museum presents an outstanding collection of artifacts from every region of ancient Pery. This museum is part of the Larco museum in Lima. Both are stunning. The presentation of the items as well as the",
          "The collection is not large, but the pieces are spectacular. The museum does a good job of explaining the civilizations that predated the Incas. In the adjoining plaza are shops and a few good restaurants. The Museum restaurant is also excellent.",
          "I love carvings and pottery, and the historical context this museum has created for its display is outstanding.",
          "Excellent artifacts arranged in chronological order. The descriptions are in English as well and very interesting. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Boutique museum with some great artefacts set out in a wonderful building. It is not too large so if you get bored by incessant displays but would like to be able to get a great flavour, this is worth a visit. It's in a nice square and is a pleasant afternoon experience",
          "i teach history at the university and i liked the museums around cusco, i learnt a lot from them and plan to come to learn more from this fascinating coutry peru.",
          "This museum had a little of everything. It was very small and we probably finished it in about an hour to hour & half. It had maybe 15 - 20 rooms of different displays from ancient artifacts (3000 B.C.), ceramics and a few weapons of Incas (200-1200 AD), art from 17th century,",
          "I did not find this museum by any means breath taking, but it was a nice activity when we were trying to hide from the rain. The pieces of art they have are at a minimum interesting and some of the descriptions comical (depending on your humor). Remember to take your student ID",
          "this one was a very interesting museum where I learnt more about Peru, I will like to vidit it again",
          "Learned a lot of new stuff about pre-Inca and pre-Colombian tribes / civilizations in Peru, their arts, life, etc. Very interesting !",
          "Visit Cusco and enjoy the art from ancient Peru. you will be amazed! the Museum is well located and a highlight to all visitors.",
          "We entered in this museum almost by accident , since almost everything was closed on Christmas Day in Cusco save for the archaeological sites.If you enjoyed the Larco Museum in Lima,you are sure to enjoy this one too. The collection comes from the Larco museum, the pieces they",
          "I am glad we visited the pre-Columbian art museum as it shows very beautiful artefacts from the last 3000 years. My objection is the very poor explanations by each of the displays, not only does it give no historical background but it is clear that the English has been",
          "This is a beautiful museum. It is not a huge museum, but the pieces represents many different eras of Pre-Columbian times and are very well preserved and shown. You are made to feel very welcome and it is well worth the visit.",
          "Several rooms of precious artwork, stunning BCand AD silver, gold, wooden figurines, pottery, jewellery carved in shell. All in incredible condition. Exquisite. No photos allowed, understandably.",
          "Go here to look at pre Columbus art in Peru and nearby countries that contributed to local culturs.minimal entrance fee, simple to visit, and very interesting, although not mind blowing.",
          "Although the Pre-Columbine Art Museum appears large on the outside, there were only a few small rooms with exhibits. The largest room was the dining area in the center on the first floor. There was construction of some sort going on so maybe some areas were closed. The exhibits",
          "The displays are amazing, the objects are simple beautiful and so well displayed. I STRONGLY recommend you visit. The only thing not quite right was the English description by the objects. The English was great, but too purple prose, to flowery, please re-write with more",
          "The museum building is an attraction in itself and the collection of art is very well laid out. Very impressive art works and I was particularly impressed by the age of some pieces and the quality of the pieces from 1500BC Worth a visit for sure",
          "As complete a collection of Pre-Columbian art representing all of Peru that exists. Just amazing the depth and breath of the collection. A must see.",
          "This museum is excellent. The Spanish and English explanations describing the objects in the collection are very informative. The illumination of the objects is very well done. An added bonus is the superb, albeit expensive, restaurant in the courtyard.",
          "This is a small museum that is packed with interesting pieces. Situated in the pretty Plaza de las Nazarenes. Well worth the visit. A small entry fee.",
          "Lots of beautiful artifacts to look at. Jewelry, pottery, paintings and more. Easy to walk to and of course surrounded by lots of restaurants and shopping!",
          "The museum has a small pre-Columbian collection of art and artifacts. The presentation of the items are done beautifully behind glass. The small size of the place allows you to really appreciate each item.",
          "A great collection with a wide variation in cultures and materials (ceramic, gold, silver, seashell, wood). Definitely worth 20 soles and everything is well set-up. My only gripe is I wish the descriptions were written with the history of the object in the mind and not like an",
          "Well worth 20 Sol - wonderful sea shells, silver, ceramics and woodwork. Textiles closed on our visit. Well labelled and presented.",
          "We toured the museum for about 20 min prior to dinner at the museum's MAP Cafe. We thought the atmosphere was calm/relaxing and enjoyed wandering from room to room looking at the exhibits. It is a small to medium sized collection with signage available in English. The",
          "Excellent art collection in this museum. Also very good text of each case very concise. Worth a visit.",
          "A very interesting museum for pre columbian art and history. nice exhibitions and we met a very friendly guide that workd there and we discussed for more than an hour with him about the incas history. Highly resomended",
          "very nice museum, but you have to go to Lima Larco museum to see the really main pieces. still best of the cusco museums",
          "was recommended by hotel to see if you have limited time; the best of all around. Was not disappointed. Substantal Spanish private home turned museum with restaurant and a few shops in main courtyard. Exhibits are nicely done and well worth the time going through. Lots to",
          "This was a great stop. I had fun learning about the different tribes. It is small, there is no guide, and the info isn't very in depth. It's a stop to include, but it won't take very long. Very close to Inka Museum and city square.",
          "Has a nice small exhibit. The English descriptions of what you Re looking at are fluff, not helpful facts.",
          "The museum has a diverse and broad collection of artifacts from different Peruvian indian cultures. Well worth it. The best museum in Cusco.",
          "A small but fascinating collection of high quality ceramics and artefacts from Peru's pre-Conquest cultures in modern and professional displays. Good Spanish and English signage and background info. The entrance is not included in the Boleto Turistico",
          "The museum has great pieces and offers a nice overview of the art of the pre-Incan cultures. The language is flamboyant and the focus in on the art not the historical aspects of the pieces.",
          "This museum is a pure joy. The top quality of the exhibits, from the earliest formative period of Peruvian cultures (Chavin, Cupisnique etc) to the late Inca, and their excellent presentation, makes the visit in the museum highly worthwhile. You will not find a better collection",
          "A great museum. They have a good information and great pieces from different Inka and pre- Inka cultures.",
          "This is an overpriced snob museum. Not that some of it isn't good. It has a small amount of pottery, gold and silver works. The explanations are written to sound as if they are trying to sell you the art, with maximum useless adjectives which say a lot of nothing. The",
          "If, like me, you're interested in pre-Columbian cultures but sometimes get a little tired of 'archaeological' exhibitions of artefacts, pay this museum a visit. The descriptions of each piece (in Spanish, English, and French) are detailed analyses of its artistic merit and",
          "Excellent and beautiful place to learn about the history of the Inca and the Spaniards interaction since the early dates.",
          "Modern, beautifully curated museum with excellent displays and good explanations in 3 languages (English Spanish and French). Contains an extensive collection of pre Columbian artefacts including some beautiful plates bowls and cups in pristine condition. There is also a lovely",
          "Particularly liked this museum with its stunning collection of pre-Columbian art. It is well-displayed lite and highly accessible to any visitor.",
          "I thought that this museum was going to be a very good one but after visited it i felt very dissapointed. Very small, not cheap if compared with other good museums around, and very poor quality of exhibition.",
          "I loved not only the exhibits of gold and Inca masks and pottery but also the way these items were displayed. Informative with a guide, though in a state of redevelopment it was worth a visit of aproximately an hour.",
          "One of the nicest museums to explore, especially on a chilly or rainy day. The museum is located in an old building around a courtyard, and each exhibit is in its own room. They have arrows on the floor to have you follow a provided route. The early pottery and well as",
          "Gold, silver, ceramics.. A small and quiet museum close to the center with historical artifacts of great interest",
          "The Museum of Precolumbian Art is located on the pretty Plaza Nazarenas. The museum was beautifully arranged in rooms around a Spanish courtyard and was beautifully set up. The rooms were arranged by the different pre-Columbian Peruvian civilizations, and the pieces were of",
          "This museum has a large collection and is well maintained. It only takes a little over an hour to see it all at a leisurely pace.",
          "The museum had a really interesting collection of artifacts. The descriptions are much more focused on the pieces as art than they were in filling in the historical context so be aware of that if you're looking for lots of historical detail. That said, it was really useful to",
          "best of the museums in Cusco, skip the others. Little is understood about the pre-Spanish history but they do a good job here for both historic and artistic merit.",
          "Not what we were expecting for 20s per person. It was an ok collection of precolumbian art, best part was the explanations of the various periods and cultures.",
          "if you are unable to make it to the Larco Museum in Lima then this is the next best thing. It is small and compact, and the exhibits are beautifully arranged and give a good representation of the various ancient Peruvian cultures.",
          "If you're going to go to a museum in Cusco this is the best one to go to and it's very easy to get to.",
          "This is a Museum with a difference with the objects presented as the works of art that they really are. Well worth a visit.",
          "The museum is a must on your Peruvian/Inca focused trip. The MAP starts you off with a spectacular display of shell jewelry that is beautifully displayed. The rest of the museum is also very good and not too large to have your interest flag",
          "I think this was the best museum we visited in Cusco. The most interesting exhibits are the examples of pre-Columbian pottery, with a separate room dedicated to each of the civilizations. This was the only museum in Cusco that allowed photography (without flash), which was a big",
          "Not a bad option if you're interested in artifacts and can't make it to a larger museum. This museum has longer hours which allowed us to have a full day of visiting other sights. We arrived after dark and had most of the museum to ourselves. (In May, it was a bit chilly since",
          "A well displayed collection of artifacts from early civilizations in Peru. Great for historians and art lovers. Well documented and very well-kept building. But some of the displays were rather dark and hard to see the print... but is it provided in three languages.",
          "Really quiet when we visited this museum. Found it a bit dark and chilly, but the exhibits were good.",
          "After a nice light lunch (more about this elsewhere), we toured to galleries of this smallish-but-well-designed museum. There is an astonishing amount of pre-Columbian, pre-Inca material culture on display here: shell-work, stone, ceramics, some textiles, and silver/gold",
          "wonderful collection of art from multiple cultures. includes a viceroy section for contrast. beautiful, organized, and modern. cannot recommend enough, a must see if you're in Cuzco.",
          "This museum not only displays ancient artifacts, it also shows how they have influenced modern era artists. There are wonderful quotes from artists on the walls and it is fascinating to see the connection between the art of long ago and recent art.",
          "It was nice seeing art from native Peruvians rather than European art/painting that dominates so many of the other sites in Cusco. It costs 20 soles or about $7 USD. Unfortunately there's no audio-guide. There is written description of each art artifact. However, some of the",
          "modern museum. Well laid out and easy to navigate. Some beautiful pieces on display. It's located in a really lovely square, Within 1/2 block of the main hotels in town. Very well thought out and laid out. $20 fee to enter.",
          "We went here to kill some time while waiting to leave for the airport. What a terrific museum! Amazingly artistic pieces from pre-Columbian civilizations. I would say we enjoyed this museum more than any other in Cusco.",
          "Really modern museum. Well laid out and easy to navigate. Some beautiful pieces on display. It's located in a really lovely square, PLaza Nazarenas. Worth a visit and don't need a Cusco Tourist Ticket...you can pay at the door.",
          "Enjoyed the time I spent at this Museum! It was interesting to see the development of a culture through the artifacts...some were quite amazing!",
          "After visiting 3 horrid museums that are included in the Cusco Tourist Card I finally found one that is worth going to. The artefacts here are awesome wonderful pieces of art. Breathtaking pottery in its simplest form. Highly recommended.",
          "Exquisite pre columbian art illustrated the culture of this part of the world before being diluted by Europeans.",
          "Loved the exhibits with descriptions in Spanish and English in the museum's eleven galleries. The artistry of the pieces is incredible.",
          "This is a beautiful, well-curated museum located on one of the most peaceful little plazas in Cusco. The collections are laid out sequentially by period and region. Each room houses a highly selective group of pieces representative of that period. The displays are well lit and",
          "Unlike some of the other museums I visited in Cusco, this one is well-lit, well-organized, and has adequate English translations. It is quite small, and well worth the visit",
          "lots of pottery and interesting things dating 3,000 yrs old! Great for an early evening visit-not crowded when we went and enjoyed it at our own pace.",
          "The ceramics collection at the MAP is a beautiful way to understand the various subcultures of Peru, each with a distinctive style and whimsy. The pieces are visually stunning and well chosen. The setting is beautiful and well appointed. You come away with an appreciation of the",
          "This is a superb museum. It's well laid out with some remarkable artefacts -- mainly ceramic -- for the multitudinous nation tribes of Peru. Some of the pieces reveal the influence pre-Columbian art had on some of our most famous 20th Century artists -- Picasso, Matisse, Henry",
          "Small, not crowded and nicely laid out. Good variety of artifacts, art and textiles. Nice little courtyard where you can sit and relax if needed. It's really worth it if you bought the multi city tourist pass. It's located right near the large plaza.",
          "This small museum is in a beautifully restored home around a courtyard. The exhibits are artistically displayed and include seashell ornamentations, silver, gold, and gorgeous pottery of many styles throughout the centuries of Peruvian culture.",
          "a small museum but containing exhibits of Inca and Pre Inca artworks of the highest standard all beautifully displayed",
          "Many people think Peru and Inca, but Peru's history began over a 1000 years before the Inca civilization. Here you'll find over 400 pieces which span from 1250 B.C. to 1532 A.D. and features works from many pre-Inca civilizations. While pricey , the museum's well-crafted",
          "The pieces on display here are almost of extremely high quality. The museum is quite nice overall, and it's worth the entrance fee and 45 minutes or so it'll take you to get through the place. It gives you a good idea of the variety of pottery, woodwork and metalwork from",
          "Well presented Pre-Columbian art and history. No huge crowds. Weavers at work. Best of Cuzco. Lunch available but US prices.",
          "This is a well-organized museum with first class exhibition of precolumbian art, mostly ceramics. It costs 20 soles entrance fee (close to $7) and is not part of the Boleto Turistico. It is a great place to visit at night because its hours are until 10 at night. The Plaza de",
          "in all the chambers , you can see the history of the peru, also the artifacts made in gold, silver, bronze, of the chimu culture, sipan, mochicas.",
          "Do not miss this one! You will be delighted surprised by its rich and remarkable collection of pre-Incaic civilizations in Peru and other countries which dated back from 8,000 AD!!!!",
          "Worth going just to wander around the building, but it also houses a small collection of beautiful artefacts.",
          "In the 21 st century we tend to think of ourselves as the most advanced people who ever lived. As we explore these ancient artifacts we see that early civilizations knew a great deal and could accomplish much even without our modern devices.",
          "although is a small museum located at Plaza Nazarenas, yet still have a lot to show. We found it that most of its 450 pieces were brought from the wider collection of its parent museum in Lima, Larco Museum.",
          "The museu is a modern and high quality establishment. Sponsored by a bank it is as expected. Nice interior of the museum and great installation of the artifacts. Good arrangement of the different epoches and a good signalization to walk through.",
          "I am really glad we chose this as our museum focus. They had an excellent collection of different ceramics and items showing different cultural heritage and history from around Peru. It is a calm and nicely laid out museum. It is not big but what is there is well worth seeing.",
          "This is a great museum. Very well presented pieces. It is not a very large place and one can see it all in around 1/2 hour.",
          "Went here after it being recommended to us as a good museum. Sure, it's got some good art, nothing you can't find in the inca museum. What you WILL find here are many long winded descriptions of the pieces, with minimal actual facts other than \"this piece captures the",
          "Excellent exhibits, with signage in Spanish and English. This museum is a branch museum of the famous one in Lima. I learned a lot. DEFINITELY worth seeing if you are into learning about culture and the art of the pre-Colombian period.",
          "It's a small museum and not busy, but it does have wonderful collections (albeit small collections) of God, silver, and pottery or sea shell collections. They provide some real insights into the culture and talents of these people. I especially liked a reddish colored seashell",
          "This is a very well appointed museum. Under the umbrella of the Larco Fundation and a local bank. Spectacular pottery, wood, silver and gold artifacts. Really beautiful rooms. They have a popular cafe in the patio, i did not have a chance to try it.",
          "You should go to this museum expecting an Art Museum. This place isn't about history, this is about looking at artwork - the fact that the pieces on display are centuries old and created by pre-colombian artisans is a secondary concern. The pieces themselves are impressive and",
          "definitely worth a visit. It's very well presented in chronological order with lots of references to how local art influenced some of the great modern artists. No tour guides and everything in English.",
          "This museum is a sister establishment to the fabulous Larco Museum in Lima. Whilst the collection is not as extensive as that of the Lima counterpart, nevertheless the exhibits are of superb quality and are once again beautifully and sensitively displayed. There are explanations",
          "This small museum is very well organized and displayed. While there were many fewer pieces than at the Larco Museum in Lima, the interpretations and descriptions of the pieces, accompanied by quotations from modern artists such as Braque and Picasso, really enhanced my view of",
          "I really don't know a lot about the art and history of Peru but this museum was so fascinating for me. The tour guide we had brought it to life and explained in a way that made the experience meaningful. The works of art are amazing for the time period.",
          "One of the best museums in Cusco. what was good about it what that the explanations were in spanish, english and french. There is also a small restaurant inside. Not too expensive. Quick visit though.",
          "It cost 20 soles to get in but this was a really fine museum. The display descriptions were in English and Spanish. Many of the Peruvian cultures were covered and there were some beautiful artifacts that showed skilled workmanship. Photographs were allowed. The bathrooms were",
          "This museum does a terrible job of providing context for and information about the artifacts it displays. Some things are not labeled at all. I felt like I came out of the museum having learned very little and that surprised and disappointed me.",
          "If you go to only one museum in Cuzco, it must be this one. The collection is a revelation and will provide and important perspective on the development of Incan culture. The description are in Spanish and English and if they are a little heavy on the hyperbole, they are",
          "The museum is very small and it has a couple of artifacts from different periods, most of them between 1200 and 1600 AD. Self guided you can see it all in 30-45 minutes. The entrance fee I felt it was a little to expensive for the content of the museum.",
          "This was a great museum to get a taste of what Peru has to offer. The history and archaeological displays were quite nice. You can take your time in the museum or see what interests you. The displays are well spaced and the pieces were very nice.",
          "A nice place to visit with many pieces, it is a nice travel into art history. the parts presentation is very good as well as the information about the parts.",
          "This museum had the most cutting edge, elegant and modern presentation and lighting with the best collection of artifacts and gold wares. The best part was that photography was allowed. This was by far the Best Museum in Cusco.",
          "Very much worth the visit to get some history of the Cusco area. I would highly recommend spending some time at this museum.",
          "This is modern, sophisticated museum of Pre-Columbian art. The items are of very high quality, and beautifully displayed, although the lighting could be a bit better in some of the display cases. There are detailed captains for each artifact, in Spanish, English, and French.",
          "Good range of pre Colombian ceramics, metalwork, statues, staffs, weapons and more. Tastefully displayed and not overcrowded with exhibits. A couple of the rooms are very dark, so watch your step. There is also a textiles shop, modern ceramics shop and cafe at this museum.",
          "i had a bit of trouble finding this museum but it was worth the effort. Situated in a beautiful old building some blocks from the Plaza de Armas, it has an impressive collection of pottery, wood carving and she'll jewelry illustrating the evolution of the arts in the various",
          "Building was pretty. Artifacts were interesting. Explanations in Spanish and English. We especially enjoyed the animal pottery and wooden carvings.",
          "This was by far the most well curated museum I visited while in Cusco. Most of the museums, while definitely worth visiting, are not up to American/European standards of curation. The Pre-Columbian Museum is an exception. I would say it's a \"must do\" while in Cusco. Get ready to",
          "We visited this museum while staying across the square at the Inkaterra La Casona hotel. It is a little pricey but well worth the cost and open until 10 pm which was a bonus for us. It is beautifully done and the lighting comes on as you enter a room. Worth a visit.",
          "I needed this to unravel the sequence and geography of the Peruvian cultures -- best ethnological museum I've visited since Hanoi. No mention of influences from the north (Olmec and Mayan) but it was clear by the geography and timeframe.",
          "Very large collection of a variety of art forms and household implements from 1100 BC to 1532 AD. Covered a wide range of native south american cultures with good signage in English and Spanish to provide context.",
          "This is a small museum but well designed and quite informative. True the contents are similar to Museum Larco in Lima but because of its size, it's more manageable. If you've already been to Larco you could skip this one. However the MAP cafe inside the courtyard serves",
          "I was really impressed with how well preserved the pottery was! This museum was definitely worth the visit even just to see the gorgeous courtyard! It's a stunning place and the collection is impressive. I was just really disappointed that the silver gallery was closed when I",
          "If you have not been to the Museo Larco in Lima, then this is a must see. The pottery collection with it's excellent display is worth the price of admission alone. There is more here than Incan artifacts. They cover Nazca, Wari, Chavin, etc. Very well lit and curated and not",
          "This museum is small, but well curated, with some beautiful pieces. It is the most expensive museum in town, but if you have to choose one, this is it. They have a good collection of Pre-Inca items, and the Mochica art pieces are just stunning.",
          "Great pieces, nice organization! Only the jewelry part already worth the visit, but everything is beautiful! Better (even been smaller) than its cousin, Museu Larco, in Lima!",
          "I thought this was a nice collection of art pieces, but overall, it seems sorely lacking in the informative qualities of the Larco Muesum in Lima (where all the artifacts at the MAP come from), as well as being smaller in scope and with almost no emphasis on the people who made",
          "Peruvian history didn't start with the Incas. This is a great little museum depicting the art of the many pre-Inca cultures. Many of the artifacts are on loan from the excellent Larco Museum in Lima -- another must-see. And the Pre-Columbian Art Museum has free admission.",
          "the collection is compact but showcases the different/distinct pottery of the region by the area/era. You can see how contents/focuses/techniques have changed throughout history in the pottery of Peru. Liked it a lot.",
          "A great collection of pieces that takes you thru the pre-columbian times. Museum is well planned, unlike many of the other museums you can see in Peru (explained by the fact that most are state owned and this one private). After visiting the museum you can have a great dinner",
          "A learning experience!!! There is so much to learn from so many cultures in which are displayed. I have done my share of visiting Pre-Columbian Museums but this one left me in awe! Just close your eyes and begin to imagine! Love it!!",
          "We had only two hours here and we could have stayed much longer. The interpretations were terribly earnest and detailed- translations were a little strange sometimes. We were happy we had chosen to go as it was a beautiful building and incredible work.",
          "Pre-Columbian ceramics. Looks like Anasazi pottery! Ten minutes of your day to see this Museum. Small fee.",
          "This is an important collection of Incan artifacts, including a pottery room, silver room, gold room, shell room and more. I believe it is part of the Larco family collection (from the Larco Museum in Lima). Please do not miss this!",
          "This review is for MAP - Museo de Arte Precolombino. It is a private museum, so the admission is higher than most, but the works on display are truly fabulous, and come from all over Peru rather than just the Cusco region. The minimalist display, peppered with quotes from",
          "This museum is compact and well done. It contains a number of interesting works, most from civilizations other than the Inca. It will broaden your understanding of the dense pre-Hispanic history of Peru. And many of the artifacts are beautiful in and of themselves and worth",
          "If you are interested in pre-Columbian cultures then this is a must see, enjoyable experience. It's a short walk up the narrow street to the left of the Cathedral (if you're facing the Cathedral). You'll quickly end up in Plaza de Nazarenas, which is a pleasant relief...no",
          "very interesting place full of amazing items. you must go!!! it contains all kinds of amazing things related to pre inca materials.",
          "they have a really nice museum, there are some excellent examples from many cultures and it is extreemly cheap to get in :)",
          "Great presentation of the pieces set out in specific types, very modern and a wonderful setting. Only small but the museum has some beautiful Incan pieces.",
          "This museum is modern and good organized. The objects are really pretty and there is an english explanation at every object.",
          "It was a fast and easy tour with lots to read about and to see about the Incas and the Spaniards. You could also watch some native ladies fabricating carpets, punchos etc... which is very interesting too.",
          "A small comfortable museum with a selection of excellent Incan pieces. A good place to begin your study of Incan artifacts.",
          "Museum firstly had friendly staff that were nice and helpful. Upon entering the museum, there is a suggested route to follow. It was pretty empty when I visited (at 1.30pm - they don't close for siesta), but note that it is a 20 Soles entrance fee, which is, in my opinion,",
          "I really enjoyed this museum.  It's professionly laid out and you can take pictures.  There is also commentary in English and some of the pieces are beautiful - definitely worth visiting! ",
          "Interesting display in the beginning of 1350 BC artifacts slips into semi interesting more nearly modern stuff. The building is very impressive in itself, but unless you are an artist interested in ancient art, and not much of it, it is not worth the fee to get in. Browse a",
          "For all the many civilizations that were in Peru this is just a very small sampling. The pieces are nicely displayed as art. I would have preferred to see them as cultural objects that belonged to a belief or ritual. I thought there could have been a greater anthropological",
          "Had a quick walk through while waiting for our RSVP of the MAP. It had some good Inca artifacts. You can see some silver and gold pieces as well as head pieces, nose decorations, etc. Not a whole lot of pieces, but go if you're close by and especially if you're going to have",
          "There is much to do in Cusco, and this is a worthy trip for a half-day or less. The Pre-Columbian museums in Lima and Quito are much better, but we are museum lovers and enjoyed all. The collection here is interesting, the Colonial art is bad, and there is little English",
          "Judging by the number of photos she took, and I took, my wife was more impressed than me. Perhaps I was suffering from museum overload, or altitude sickness, but she loved it. There are some incredible pieces of pottery/ceramics and metalwork. And they let you take photos.",
          "An exquisite small collection, stunningly presented in a building that is itself an attraction. Open until 10pm and we found it perfect for a quiet, meditative evening visit. Head there before or after dinner and be sure to enjoy the rather elaborate English translation on the",
          "This is definitely worth your time if you're wandering the streets... Someone has put some money and effort into this place. It has an amazing collection of pottery, jewelry, coins, etc. Explanations in Spanish and English. Takes about an hour. This one isn't on the Cusco",
          "This is so interesting and it is easy and short. Gives you a birds eye view. Worthwhile. Also restaurant inside \"Map\" is excellent but you must make reservations.",
          "A beautifully displayed and well-lit museum, the MAP is an affiliate of the Larco museum in Lima. It's not clear how often the pieces are rotated from Lima. The Moche ceramics are particularly stunning, so anyone with an interest in Moche culture shouldn't skip this place. The",
          "Interesting Art Museum, I enjoyed seeing the different artwork, painting, statues, very interesting.",
          "I'm usually not much for spending hours at museums. However, this is definitely amongst the best I've seen. I enjoyed the art displays and appreciated the explanations provided to illustrate Pre-Columbian culture.",
          "Lovely small museum that has beautiful and informative exhibits. Although most exhibits have English explanations, it is best to visit with a knowledgeable guide.",
          "Even though this museum is not part of the \"Boleto Turistico\" or tourist pass, it is a must see. Here you'll find some Inca pieces of art, which are very rare to come by since the conquest of Peru was a massive looting. It is a very nice gallery with displays of ancient Peruvian",
          "I see a recent reviewer that described this as more of a \"gallery\" than a \"museum\". I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. This isn't necessarily a bad museum so much as not at all what I thought it would be from the reviews and the website. What I'm interested in with",
          "Very well laid out and designed as a gallery rather than a museum with interesting quotes from more recent artists describing the positive effects such early art has had on their own work.",
          "A wonderful museum with interesting artifacts beautifully displayed. The explanations with each artifact were written in language aimed at someone with a PhD in Pre-Columbian Art. So skip the information and just enjoy the experience.",
          "This museum has amazing collections of jewelry, pottery, coins, etc. from a number of the civilizations that lived in Peru for the last few thousand years. A very worthwhile experience! Our guide took us there for about 1 hour, and then we returned later in the day for a",
          "At first I thought I would skip this place because I'd read that much of the collection came from the Larco Museum in Lima, and I had already been there (and several other Pre-Columbian museums) but I am so glad I went! The museum itself is beautiful, and the collection is very",
          "This is a nice little museum. We went here on our first day when we were alcamating to the altitude and trying to take it easy. Small but well done and informative. If you are looking for something relaxing for and hour or two it give perspective of the culture and timeline.",
          "This makes a for a great 1-2 hour museum tour. The artifacts are very interesting. Be sure to read the description of each area/era as you enter each room.",
          "It is small and doesn't take long to go through but is very much worth a visit and would be a shame to miss if you have made it all the way to Cusco. The exhibits are excellent and the descriptions are in Spanish and English. Also it is open until 10pm.",
          "A rather small museums hosted in a typical palace on a very nice plaza. Pre-columbian art displayed by theme/region/period, with very nice references and quotes from their several artists they inspired: Picasso, Matisse, Braque. Our only regret is that the quotes were only in",
          "The museum displays relatively few pieces, but the ceramics that were chosen are exemplary. We did not expect the graceful, subtle work that represents Peruvian craft over two millennia. Equal to the quality of the artwork is the interpretation and commentary. It is said that",
          "As often happens just when I thought I had covered most of the interesting places of interest in Cuzco I happened across this museum.One of the most important things was that the museum had most of the exhibits with description in English which made the visit far more",
          "This museum shows artefacts in gold, silver and wood, as well as pottery. They are beautiful pieces of primitive art, covering a variety of Peruvian cultures. The Inca are represented, but there are earlier cultures going back more than 2000 years. The works are very well",
          "This museum is worth a visit, especially if you don't have time to hit the Museo Larco in Lima. Very well set up and interesting collection.",
          "We really liked the excellent displays of some fantastic artefacts and the links into the art world through quotation. Good lighting and presentation. Some of the descriptions were a little too effusive for our western sentiments, but that just added to our enjoyment! On own",
          "We found this small museum a true delight. The pieces selected were generally exquisite and offered good insights into the excellent artistic skills both for the Inca civilization and the various Peruvian civilizations that preceded it.",
          "This museum is located in the city square.It was well laid out We loved reading the history of the Incas,seeing ancient pottery and sculptures was fascinating ,it gave me more of an idea about that civilisation.",
          "Beautiful exhibits, with a great restaurant too! The pottery is magnificent. It is a bit on the pricey side, but it's a very relaxing way to spend an afternoon or evening in Cusco!",
          "I really enjoyed the displays and layout of this museum, which shows a huge and fabulous collection of Pre-Columbian art. Amazing ceramic sculptures.",
          "Its a bit pricey to get in for the amount you see but this place has some good pottery works from the pre-columbian era. You'll get through the entire place incredibly quickly. Their descriptions are hilarious - someone trying to be postmodern or something. They break your brain",
          "Visited here as a family on a rainy afternoon after hearing good reviews about the museum. Overall the museum has high quality displays and good descriptions of the items but we were surprised by how small the museum is for the cost of entry. There is also not a lot of focus on",
          "A very large collection of artifacts, many of them recovered in pristine condition. They are displayed and cataloged for easy viewing by the visitor. Descriptive placards are shown in 6 languages. A veritable treasure of the history of these Andes civilizations.",
          "Absolutely loved this museum and the art inside. We went by chance solely because of a reservation at the cafe, and we're glad we did.",
          "We came across this museum by chance when we were exploring Cusco and the area around Hotel Del Monasterio. Located off a quiet square It is well laid out and informative, interesting displays and captions in English. Its pocket sized for a museum and as such not overwhelming.",
          "After having visited the wonderful Lorca Museum in Lima, we thought that this 'sister' museum might be a bit of a disappointment. Totally wrong . The collection here is totally unique and fabulous. Along with the terrific collection, each piece has a wonderful description",
          "For starters, the quantity and quality of artifacts is simply amazing. I find it hard to believe that a private collector was able to amass a collection of this magnitude. The presentations are also well done, with multi language explanations of each exhibit, so that you learn",
          "Certainly the best museum in Cusco in terms of presentation and interpretation. The focus is primarily on ceramics, but what insight they provide into the pre-Incan cultures!",
          "Interesting short overview of the history of the area. Cute little building, well worth the hour it takes to see every item",
          "If you can't make it to the Larco museum in Lima this is a must see. A very small sample of what is available in the Larco museum. Many Incan items which are in short supply due to the large amount melted down or removed from the area.",
          "This private museum contains a wonderful collection of Pre-Columbian ceramics, beautiful shell and some gold and silver artifacts. The showcases are well lit and the English translations were well done, which is not always the case in Cusco museums. Definitely the best museum",
          "Peru is home to unrivaled architectural ruins but to very few good museums. In general museums in both Lima and Cusco have mediocre collections very poorly displayed with little or no labeling in English. A few are flat out horrible, like the Museo de Sito Coricancha in Cusco.",
          "I'm not a massive fan of pre-columbian ceramics - but this collection is outstanding! It is the best collection of ceramics I have ever seen! The interpretations are also in English which is great. There are also gold and silver rooms and a room with beautiful jewellery made",
          "This is a beautifully organized and not-to-miss museum especially if you enjoy ceramic art. My husband and I were very impressed with the collection, the way it was displayed throughout the museum, and the breadth of skill and creativity reflected in the range of ancient",
          "The museum is very well organized. The displays are well lighted, it has a variety of ancient INKA ceramic as well in gold and silver. it's a point of reference to Peru's history. A must see it. I love anything that tells about INKA history...",
          "This museum is a good short stop in San Blas. It is lovely displays in an old building. Well though out, and well laid out. Very interesting to see the high degree of art during early periods here. Not what I expected, and I enjoyed this place immensely",
          "Well worth the trip. This is a bit smaller than Larco, but has exceptional Pre-Columbian art as well as strong historical references.",
          "This is a very interesting museum when visited with a guide. I learned alot about the culture and its diversity thru the ages. It is a must while in Cusco",
          "There are so many museums in Cuzco its hard to know which ones to go to, I would say if you have to choose one this is it, it is very interesting how they have framed the exhibits, making them esthetic as well as interesting - making you see the art as well as the history in the",
          "This museum has a nice collection of Pre-Columbian Art- Moche, Nazca, Chimu, Huari, etc, if this interests you. Not as extensive as the Larco or Archaeological museums in Lima, this collection can be seen easily in 1-2 hours; it is also open late so you can save it for when",
          "...especially if you're on your way 'down' [or up to] from San Blas or want to check out the MAP cafe menu [lunch and dinner different]. Think this was about 7$USD and we spent about 60-75 minutes walking around and taking pictures in the not-so-huge museum. The initial rooms",
          "What a collection...pre-historic stone tools, carvings, ceramic bowls, textiles and even Inca mummies! This place has it all and was our favorite museum. I believe it was only 10 soles to get in... a real bargain!",
          "A sister museum to the famous one in Lima. This was nice for us since we didn't visit Lima on our trip to Peru, but still got to see the pre-columbian pieces. The museum is in a nice, well-appointed building. Photography was allowed(!). Not a lot of people, so you could",
          "Of all the museums I visited in Peru I would have to say that the Pre-Columbian Art Museum was my favorite. It is a bit smaller than some of the other museums you might come across but that just makes it more manageable and more room to see the exhibits. There is a fairly nice",
          "Unlike the other museums I went to in Cusco, this one allowed photography as long as you did not use a flash. Very nice collection of pottery and other artifacts. The gold ear and nose ornaments were pretty interesting.",
          "We saw a sister museum in Lima, and this was right by the hotel in Cuzco. Wonderful ceramics and metal objects-- weapons, jewels, and such. Beautifully presented, and not overwhelming. Within the museum are also other things, like a cooperative selling textiles, and a",
          "A few if us from our tour group decided to go here on a free morning. There is a wonderful collection of pottery, wood carvings and some jewelry displayed by time period and region. It took us about an hour and 15 minutes to peruse the entire collection that's on 2 levels. It's",
          "This is a remarkable museum, also established by the Larco family, with an interesting concept because its approach to the Pre Columbian cultures is focused on their Art Masterpieces. A stunning selection of pieces, brilliantly displayed in a lovely old mansion make it a jewel",
          "This museum beautiful displays truly outstanding examples of Pre-Columbian art. Almost every piece could be displayed at a show called primitivism and modernism. One room is more breathtaking than the next and the museum atmosphere is verry tranquil. The restaurant also",
          "A great museum in the centre of Cusco..definitely worth a visit while you are in the city. Lot's of interesting things to see",
          "This is without doubt one of the most well presented museums I have visited. The museo is situated in the lovely Plaza de las Nazarenas not far from the Plaza de Armas. It is small enough in size and centres around a picturesque little courtyard. The pieces on display range from",
          "They have the best selection of Pre Inca pottery in the whole of Cusco, and its restaurant is also fanastic",

          "OK, so here is a secret confession. I don't much enjoy seeing ancient pots and pans in stuffy museums. This museum though I loved. It's a small collection, beautifully presented and i found the exhibits stunningly beautiful. It even impressed my 11 year old daughter who read",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin, also known as Cusco Cathedral, is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cusco. The cathedral is located on the Plaza de Armas. The entire building was built between 1560-1654,Adjacent and joined to the cathedral is the smaller Iglesia del Triunfo, the first Christian church to be built in Cusco. The Iglesia de la Compania de Jesus, also on the Plaza de Armas, was built at a similar time as the cathedral.\nThe Cathedral, in addition to its official status as a place of worship, has become a major repository of Cusco's colonial art.  It also holds many archeological artifacts and relics. The cathedral was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the City of Cuzco listing in 1983.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kiswarkancha ===\nThe Incas built the temple known as Kiswarkancha on the main square in Cusco. It was the Inca palace of Viracocha, ruler of the Kingdom of Cusco around a century before the Spanish colonists arrived.  The aboriginal name of this city was Qusqu. Although it was used in Quechua, its origin has been found in the Aymara language. The word itself originated in the phrase qusqu wanka (\"Rock of the owl\"), attending to the foundational myth of the Ayar siblings.Near to the Kiswarkancha was the Suntur Wasi, an armoury and heraldry centre for the Inca royalty. When the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Cuzco, they decided to take down the temple and build their Christian cathedral in that prominent site.\n\n\n=== Basilica Cathedral of our Lady of Assumption ===\nThe cathedral's construction began in 1559 on the foundations of Kiswarkancha.  It is shaped like a Latin cross. The location of Viracocha's palace was chosen for the purpose of removing the Inca religion from Cusco, and replacing it with Spanish Catholic Christianity. Because 1559 was only 26 years after the conquistadores entered Cusco in 1533, the vast majority of the population was still of Quechua Inca descent. The Spaniards used the Incas as a labour workforce to build the cathedral.The original designs for the 1-acre (4,000 m2) large construction were drawn by the Spanish architect and conquistador, Juan Miguel de Veramendi. His design of a Latin cross shape incorporated a three-aisled nave, where the roof was supported by only 14 pillars. Over the 95 years of its construction, the building work was supervised by Spanish priests and architects, until its completion in 1654.\nMost of the stones from the building were taken from Sacsayhuam\u00e1n, an Inca holy and defensive structure located on the hills above Cusco. Due to its large size, much of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n remains intact.\nJust as the temple of Viracocha was removed and the holy stones of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n were employed to build the cathedral, the intentional desecration of Inca religious architecture, once the Spaniards learned that the very sand spread on Cusco's main plaza was considered sacred, they removed it and employed it in the cathedral's mortar.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Gothic-Renaissance style of the cathedral reflects that of Spain during the period of the Spanish conquest of South America and also Cusco. There is also evidence of Baroque influence in the facade on the Plaza de Armas.\nThe Incas incorporated some of their religious symbolism into the cathedral, for example, the carved head of a jaguar (an important god or religious motif found widely through much of ancient Peru) is part of the cathedral doors.\n\n\n== Artifacts ==\n\n\n=== Cathedral artifacts ===\n\nThere are many Catholic artifacts within the Cusco Cathedral, some of which are fine pieces of colonial craftsmanship. These include the following:\n\nAltar: The cathedral has two altars, the original lambran (alder-tree) at the back, and in front of that, the neoclassical embossed silver altar, which is currently used. The silver altar was originally cedar wood covered in gold flakes, but in 1803 (according to the inscription on the front of the silver panel), Heras Bishop donated the silver to be beaten and applied to the altar.\nMaria Angola Bell: The north tower of the cathedral supports the famous Maria Angola, a bell that is 2.15 metres high, and weighs approximately 5980 kg. It was cast in 1659 and named, according to local tradition, after an Angolan slave who threw gold into the crucible where the bell was being made. As the bell is cracked, it is rung only on special occasions.  It has been claimed that the bell is audible from more than 20 miles away.\nSacristy: The sacristy, a highly decorated part of the cathedral, displays a large collection of allegoric paintings by Marcos Zapata from the 18th century. Also, many portraits of Cusco's bishops hang in the cathedral, beginning with Vicente de Valverde (see 'artwork'), the first resident bishop of Cusco. Within the sacristy, a large, dark painting of the crucifixion is commonly attributed to the Dutch artist, Anthony van Dyck.  Some local guides say it is the work of the Spanish artist Alonso Cano, from the 17th century.\nChrist of the Earthquakes: This wooden crucifix is black from centuries of smoke and dust. The Black Christ was not cleaned during restoration of the cathedral interior in the 1990s, when the burning of candles was ended. The crucifix is taken outdoors each year in the Lord of Miracles Procession during Holy Week, the Monday after Palm Sunday, in commemoration of the 1650 earthquake.\n\n\n=== Artwork ===\n\nMuch of the artwork in the cathedral originated from the Escuela Cuzquena (Cusco School of art). This was a school that was built by the Spanish to educate the Incas and their descendants with the methods and disciplines of European renaissance style artwork. This school was famous throughout the colonial Americas, but the Quechua painters were limited to painting scenes of European and Catholic importance. The restrictions imposed on the Inca artists meant that they were not permitted to sign their own artwork, so much of it is unidentifiable. Here is a list of some of the most notable pieces found within the cathedral:\n\nPintura Senor de los Temblores. The oldest surviving painting in Cusco, which depicts the whole of the ancient city during the 1650 earthquake. Many of the townspeople can be seen carrying a crucifix (see the 'Cathedral Artifacts' section) around the Plaza de Armas, praying for the tremor to end.\nVicente de Valverde. A portrait of the friar who became a bishop at Cusco, after accompanying Francisco Pizarro on his conquests.\nChrist's 12 Parables. An incomplete collection of twelve paintings by the Quechuan artist Diego Quispe Tito. There were initially twelve canvases (completed in 1681) to depict the twelve months and zodiac symbols of the year, incorporating the parables of Jesus into the pictures.\n\n\n== Iglesia del Triunfo ==\n\nThe Church of Triumph, to use its English translation, was built in 1538, just three years after the conquistadores settled in Cusco. It was built over Suntur Wasi, which was an Inca ceremonial building adjoining the palace of Viracocha, in a similar way to the way that the Cathedral is now adjoined to the earlier Iglesia del Triunfo.The name of the Church of Triumph derives from the history of the Spanish settlers in Cusco. At one point, presumably between 1533, and 1536, the Spanish were cornered by a besieging army of Incas, led by Manko Inka. The final stand for the Spanish was in the Suntur Wasi, before its demolition, and just as it seemed that they were on the verge of defeat, the Spanish miraculously managed to drive back the Incas. The Catholic conquistadores attributed this victory to Saint James the Greater (the patron saint of Spain), who was reported at the time to descend from heaven to drive back the Incas. This is why the church is called the Church of Triumph, and also why there is a statue of St. James atop a horse within the Church, depicting him slaying an Inca.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\n\n\n== Notes ==",

          "This museum feels like it was put together by a middle-schooler back in 1985. It's sad and damp and dark and, well, the best thing I saw there was a T-chart comparison of Inkan v. Western philosophies ('nuf said). Other than that, I'd say if you have the boleto touristico,",
          "This is the Spanish cathedral built on top of the Inca Temple of the Sun so it is history built on top of history. This is a very neat museum. It is packed with people so bring your patience, but it is worth it. It is located in the Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Peru so it is in",
          "This is a really cool place to visit and, unlike many places in Cusco, has excellent English translations of all its signs and a good audio guide for only an extra sole (bringing entrance up to 16 soles total). The gardens are beautiful, and there\u2019s some contemporary art",
          "This place had many neat aspects. The architecture and exhibits were very interesting. This was part of our half-day tour of Cusco and well worth it!",
          "Cusco was the capital of Peru during Inca regime and Qorikancha was the main temple and centre of Inca religion. It was named Qorikancha i.e.Goden Temple. In sixteenth century, its walls were covered with gold and there were 3 main gods- Viracocha, the moon goddess Quilla and",
          "We enjoyed both the exhibits and the beautiful grounds here. This is a good spot to visit when you are acclimating to the altitude--not too strenuous and lots to look at.",
          "This is an extremely interesting building - Has so much history and an array of different areas with different history and information well worth a few hours to visit and take in the history and culture",

          "Not to be missed attraction, this temple is preserved for generation where you will witness the grandour of INKA engineering and the history and a lot more. A local guide is a must to explain you the stories and the facts.",
          "Another museum in Cusco which I feel had a little less than others to view but still very interesting. Showed again Inca expertise which is amazing",
          "We did a one hour tour of this Incan ruin, on which a church was built by the Spanish conquistadors. Even with what little was left of Incan architecture, we could appreciate their craft, precision and creativity. The structures built by the Incas are so solid that they can",
          "We ended up coming here as we felt we needed a bit of culture during our free day in Cusco. It was absolutely fabulous. Part inca temple, part church, for us the highlight was actually the gardens. They're really quite extensive, beautifully maintained and the perfect place to",
          "Sometimes you tell yourself when you are traveling: why would I visit a very old church? What can I see differently from what I saw in the church home? Now I believe and I am convinced that I have not seen anything like it in all the churches I visited, Sagrada Familia, Notre",
          "This is definitely a must see. Not only the church is so beautiful and very well Maintained but also the adjacent monastery with some authentic Inka buildings and a fantastic collection of Cusco painters. I highly recommend hiring a guide outside. Well worth it!",
          "The heart of the Inca world!! Please do take a guided tour, otherwise you won't see it the same way. Great emotions when you go inside the cloister with the inca walls ... Great time",
          "The heart of the Inca world transformed by the Spanish conquistadores ... A guided tour is much needed to really understand the place and find all the elements from both civilizations. Worth the visit for sure!!",
          "This is a gorgeous building with fascinating history. Definitely a top site to visit in Cusco. All the signs were in both Spanish and English. The only negative was that it was extremely crowded with tour groups during our visit.",

          "A beautiful place with so many interesting layers! The Inka were amazing builders, and it is facinating to get a peek at how they did it. There is beautiful artwork and spanish architecture as well as the ubiquitous giftshop, but the Inka remains are the crown jewel amongst all",
          "Qorikancha isn't too large - you can easily visit the church and former Inca temple ruins in an hour or two. And it's not expensive - admission was 15 soles per person (a little under $5 USD). But it's definitely worth a stop if you're in Cusco. It's really interesting - and was",

          "The Qorikancha Palace was once the center of the Inca Empire. It was literally lined and laced with gold. So, of course, the Spanish Conquistadors sacked it, destroyed it and built a church in its place. The juxtaposition of ancient and colonial makes for a compelling visit.",
          "Built literally as the \"temple at the center of the world\" during the Inca period the stones that survive as the foundation for the Convento de Santo Domingo testify to the excellence of the stone masons. The artifacts that survived the conquistadores are very few but are well",

          "This amazing stonework was most definitely not done by the Inka! Tour guides always tell you that but the Inka's building style is totally different and they did not have the technology to do this amazing work. This is most probably the work of an older civilization with ties to",

          "This place is so beatyful and interesting. You van not visit Cuzco without visiting this place. There is so much of all Cuzcos historic, you will get to know here. And the building in it self is worth watching. I recommend paying for a guide. Do it!",

There are a couple rooms with some stones, and a few boards with history, but not much else. The garden in the back had a good view so that was nice. Wouldn\u2019t recommend",

          "A must see if interested in Cusco\u2019s past. This place does not offer tours (?!) or at least I could not find any. There are, however, people standing by the entrance, who offer tour guide service. We made a mistake not to hire one, there is lots to see. Apparently the convent is",
          "Koricancha is the most impressive example of how Inca and Hispanic cultures fused together. The temple is a symbol of Western dominance. The site is a living example of the co-existence of Peru's past with European architecture. The temple was built with finely carved stones.",
          "Our guide took us to the convent to show us a number of different things. You can see how the Spanish covered the walls prior to an earthquake helping to start the reclamation of true Incan walls. There is also interesting artwork that has subtle details changed to implicate the",
          "I wish someone could tell me who did the contemporary oil paintings in the Choir room above the main chapel here. They were intriguing and were just the cherry on top of what was a very interesting afternoon. I would spring for the extra 10 sole's for a guide. My group of",

          "The once holiest Inca site - Qorkancha (meaning 'Golden Courtyard\"), serves as a testament to the brutal conquest of indigenous people and the effects thereafter. Much of its stonework forms the foundation of the Santo Domingo church and convent. Qorikancha was the religious,",

          "We went with kids of 14 and 10 and we all enjoyed the visit. Definitively worth a visit! It was quite crowded even though we arrived within 30 minutes of the opening, but that did not hinder us. There are quite a few number of guides offering their service, but in my opinion",
          "We were so sick of anything related to Spanish conquest of Peru and Catholicism by the time we got here that we almost skipped this gem of a city within a city. A guided tour is highly recommended. We learned all about how much it would have royally sucked to be a nun here in",
          "One of the most important stops in Cusco - beautiful place with tons of history. We visited here as part of a city tour and really enjoyed it. Amazing examples of the architectural perfection the Inca were able to achieve. Wish we could've spent time in the gardens - they were",

          "Pay for a guide, we didn\u2019t and just walked through ourselves and missed a good portion of the history. Even without a guide, the place was amazing. The church paintings and items were wonderful to see. Added with an outside area to walk through made the 2 hours worthwhile.",

          "From the outside it's interesting to see the Inca-Spanish combination in the construction. Also similar combinations in other buildings in the area. We didn't pay the 15 Sol to go inside Santo Domingo. One can appreciate it from the outside and save money",

          "You can easily spend an hour or two here with so much history it's hard not to get lost into the exhibits. This site is separate from the boleto turistico but we'll worth the few soles per person it takes to get in.",
          "Loved this place - so much history!! It was worth it to pay for a guide, if not you missed so many of the details.",
          "We did not know what the museum was about. We thought there is something outside, bu then they said that is just outside. There is nothing to see here. Save your time. It is included in the Boleto Touristico, but waste of your time.",
          "What a great place to visit. Enjoyed it more than the cathedral. The pillars, artwork, gold coated walls and pure gold statues and the history is so interesting. The tombs of the first two Peruvian saints, Santa Rosa de Lima and San Mart\u00edn de Porres. Tour guides in the front",
          "Worst museum we've been to in a long time. Don't get it confused with the the actual museum on the actual site nearby which is definately worth seeing. The displays were ancient and look like they were created and translated by school children. Don't take my word for it, look",
          "this was really cool. the area has an underground museum that opens up into this grass area.quite a different experience. but don't be concerned because even though you go down into the museum part, it is quite open and easy accessed so don't be scared in any way. I did not go",
          "I actually liked this Convento more than the Cathedral and other shrines in Cusco. This is the place where there was an important Inca temple and on top of it there is now a Spanish Convent. There is a small admission fee to get in, well worth it. You walk in and you can",
          "Probably the most interesting about it is that it is a church built on the base of an Inca's temple. Above that not specifically impressive.",
          "Absolutely a must see while in Cusco. Take 2 hours to stroll or on a tour for the full history and stories behind the scenes.",
          "Spaniards didn't leave much after conquest but some walls of the Inka temple survived showing high precision of stone masonry design for earthquakes. very impressive workmanship includes water piping connections made from stone",

          "The artwork is wonderful. The almost fully intact inca temple located inside the boundaries of the property is quite amazing",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Hire a guide in order to understand what you are looking at. We learned a lot!",
          "nice church, it has free entries. the view from outside is nice, it has great garden. gets busy with tourist.",
          "The museum consists, in fact, of two separate parts, with two separate entrances. One part is ruins of Inca Temple and a church built on top of it. Many photos of this part are on TA site. A great place to visit with or without an excursion. The guides in front are expensive.",
          "Glad we visited but probably woudlhht have if it hadnt just been part of our tour. It was good to see the original set out for Incan life and culture and to hear the stories alongside it all. Definitely needs a tour or audio or you lose some of the significance.",
          "Structure is imposing but its history is the most significant. Little bit of a stroll from the center unless you take the pedestrian passage which we discovered later. Lots of tour groups to follow around. Tip: Use your student ID and don't confuse the catacomb museum",
          "Worth a visit to see the results of another Incan Temple destroyed by the Spainish. Some of the original Temple stones remain. Photos are not permitted inside due to the old paintings, but you are free to photograph the building and it\u2019s beautiful courtyard. A guide is a must,",
          "Located centrally in Cusco and well worth a visit. Glad we made the effort. The Inca foundations/remains are substantial and were incorporated into the Spanish Cathedral. As with other structures, those built by the Incas survive the earthquakes whereas the Spanish efforts are",
          "Visited this site with our tour group. Our tour guide provided by Condor Travel was very informative and gave us all the historical information regarding this particular site. Shame of how people were back then by destroying beautiful sites, which of course they didn\u2019t consider",
          "Very nice, this is the last and the best place visited in case you hide the archeological Cusco tour, very interest, full of history, really worthy!",

          "What remains of the old Inca part of this church is interesting and has a lot of history. To appreciate this place, a guide is a must. Someone who can explain all of the little details makes it come alive. Photos are restricted regarding the paintings but not the rest of the",

          "We visited so many sites in Cusco that it's hard to keep them all straight. Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and layer your clothes because it's quite warm when you're in the sunshine and it chills down very quickly and is quite cold at night. So please plan ahead when",
          "This was our first stop on our walk to the old city centre. We enjoyed the church built atop an old inca temple and the history around it. It also gave some pretty views of the city.",
          "The beautiful gardens and curved foundation walls are a sight to behold. I'm glad the Spanish invaders didn't destroy the garden or the foundations. Inside the 'church' are remnants of the old temple...absolutely stunning. Ancient history hidden among the original foundations",
          "To see the combination of the 2 cultures is amazing, Inca and Spanish combined is awesome, great walking tour!!!",
          "This temple as many other Inka constructions was distroyed by Catholic invaders. Nevertheless it's a great historic place to visit with a good Guide.",

          "The museum has some interesting pieces to offer, but it could use some more love, especially at the information boards, they look old, dirty and confusing.",
          "15 Soles is too much for the little things it has to offer. Sure the inca temple is awesome and super interesting, but there is not much left of it, that you can see. Most of it can bee seen from outside and the religios paintings didn't do it for me. Save your money.",
          "It is a Catholic but, unlike virtually all other churches in Cusco, they actually preserved the Inca ruins within. That was strictly the focus of our tour but that was OK. It was more interesting than the more modern stuff. Probably the best Inca ruins without having to take a",
          "The gardens around are beautiful, if you are lucky and get a nice day with no rain is good to have a lunch in the garden and enjoy the view.",
          "A beautiful church that contains both Inka and Spanish architecture, with amazing paintings and arches. A must see.",
          "Did this in the morning on our first full day in Cusco. When we went to buy our tickets, there was a Peruvian man outside who told us he was a professor and would give us a personal tour for a fee. We were skeptical but decided what the heck and after negotiating the fee went",
          "a good museum with many things to know and learn about the history, come to this place with the service of the city tour in the city of Cusco.",
          "We came here only because we had paid for the tourist ticket when we visited Sacsayhuaman, and we had some free time. It was underground, and a little hard to find. I took a photo of an empty display case! It desperately needs some funding. In the end it was quite funny and but",
          "It was incredible to see the Incan architecture, religion, history, and art displayed all in one place. It has everything, from a museum, paintings, mini temples, and a wonderful mix of Spanish and Incan architecture!",
          "The interior of Convento de Santo Domingo is amazing with astounding artwork. The exterior is comprised of Spanish colonial architecture and Incan architecture. You can tell the distinct Incan architecture from the Spanish architecture.",
          "I would\u2019ve liked to have spent more time here but alas we were on a tight schedule. This is the fourth church built on this site. Earthquakes in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries destroyed the previous ones. I know it\u2019s \u2018just another church\u2019 but there was something magical",
          "This museum was described as the mummie museum to us, and they do have a couple Inca mummies. Its a small museum, and if you do not have a lot of time I would recommend going to the Museum of regional history instead.",
          "This cathedral was built upon the ruins and founations of an Inca temple. We visited as part of a city tour and having a guide was definitely worthwhile. A beautiful place with a lot of history, but you need a guide as there is very limited signage.",
          "We visited this site as part of a Cusco city tour. Very interesting history and ruins, exemplifying the precision of Inca architecture. Make sure you have a guide or at least an audio-tour to get the most of the explanation of each building, their significance, and even details",
          "Great example of Incan construction, history, art, and religious history. We took a brief tour and are so happy that we did. You can often find tour guides outside waiting for customers. If they are official tour guides, go with them. They are highly educated and can provide you",
          "This site is one of the \"must\" sites, if you want to understand more about the Inca. I wish there would be more written explanations in English, next to every point of interest.",
          "This sight was wonderful. This was the location of the Inca Temple of the Sun. It is basically a Spanish church built on an Inca temple. Remnants of the Inca structures can be seen. There is a rose garden out back. The bathrooms are clean. Admission is cheap.",
          "Worth the time to stop here on your tour. The gardens are lovely on the outside and so interesting on the inside. We went on a guided tour and glad we did!",
          "There are a lot of tour groups that venture into this beautiful place. Our tour guide was extremely informative and had a wealth of knowledge for both the Incan ruins as well as the Christian component to this sacred place. I highly recommend this place as it is easy to get to",
          "The guide was wonderful showing us the old Inca Temple of the Sun now a Christian convent. The Incan stone work was simply amazing. The knowledge the Inca's had of the perfect location for the temple to catch the sun at there perfect moment, amazing.",
          "Also part of the cusco city tour Highly recommend having a guide to take you through Our Guide was very good and we actually spent almost 45 mins in here going through the history Great visit and must do in cusco U can see the Incan building design as the base of this",

          "Cusco was the \u201cVatican\u201d of the Inca Empire and Qorikancha was the crown jewel, the holiest of holies equivalent to the Sistine Chapel. It is essential to visit all the important Inca sites with a knowledgeable guide to learn the cultural significance of the buildings. Even a",
          "Very interesting, we stopped here as part of our tour with Vantage and enjoyed the Convent & the incan ruins that this convent was built on top of .",
          "One of the highlights of our stay in Cusco! We were so happy we had a very well informed guide to explain the significance of what we were seeing. The Inca people built the temple with extraordinary precision, each rock smoothed and fashioned to fit for a perfect, smooth",
          "A must-see when visiting Cusco. This place is beautiful and full of history. I loved the gardens and the Iglesia de Santo Domingo.",
          "We went on a Sunday afternoon...bad move. The place was infested with tour groups and pushy tour guides that had no concept that other people might want to look at the place. Avoid the tour groups if you can.",
          "The tour of the convent was interesting, especially the Incan ruins that the convent is built upon. The view looking of the city at sunset was very pretty.",
          "This is a large site with plenty to see. Consider getting a guide to help bring it to life for you. It has a pretty convent, a museum and nice views.",
          "You can really tell the original Inka stone work and what the colonials added on afterwards. Gardens are pretty",
          "If you are interested about Inca history, you will know what happened almost 500 years ago at this place. Originally named Intikancha for reverence to Inti (God of sun), it is located at the old Inca capital of Cusco. Destroyed around the 16th century war by the so-called",
          "This place was originally the Sun Temple for the INCAS. Then, the Spanish built a church on top of it. You can still see par tof the old temple. It's simply amazing how they built all buildings. Definitely worth to visit",
          "The museum is small and has some English translations. The day we went there seem to be an issue with the plumbing. No wows or compelling reasons to make a dedicated trip. Sad to say.",
          "You run out of adjectives, awesome place. Nice displays, Still a functioning church, nice grounds. Spanish and Inca-",
          "Interesting Architectural / culture of spanish assimilation of locals, Nice details inside of former palace. Peru is still in transition, We spoke with many Quecha and native pride is bounding. Ex. Many streets now have a spanish name and an indigenous name.",
          "The overlay of the catholic church on top of the Incan site as it was revealed by a prior earthquake was rather interesting, and the wall with the milky way mural was particularly enlightening...still better with a guide, though!",
          "Whilst Machu Picchu is a brilliant outdoor exhibit of a town, Qorikancha shows the same under cover. Now integrated into the Dominican church the spectacularly artful Incan stone cutting is visible both as internal walls & the external terracing fronting a large parkland. There",
          "What a surprise to find this cathedral just across the road from my hotel and to see the incredible blend of Inca stone carved from Basalt in the style with no mortar and great joints with the Spanish and Moorish architecture built above. The church was originally a sacred",
          "Unique place, full of a mystique energy. My recommendation is to visit it at noon, the sounds and the light will play with your mind!",
          "Do not miss this Cusco historic attraction on your visit. It's beautiful and well-worth your time for its relaxing educational value and splendid exhibits.",
          "Beautiful setup and lots of history will reveal itself visiting this beautiful site. One of the must-do things while in Cusco. Respite from the busy downtown and a lovely learning experience with very nice expositions.",
          "After seeing so many enthusiastic reviews I was a bit disappointed with the place. Of course it is important for its history and is just beautiful inside and outside, but it is rather a short visit. I paid 8 soles for the entrance (student discount) plus 25soles for a private",
          "I wish we had paid for a guide to better explain the history of the Inca sun temple. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating place.",
          "Built as many other structures by the Spaniards on the foundation of the Inca structure that was destroyed by the spaniards, this place has lots of history.It was just up the street from our hotel on the way to the main square...we could have easily spent the whole morning at",
          "We see a big difference in Inka stone layering techniques vs the Convent sanctuary which choose to take the Inka stones to build.",
          "Right in the middle of town and very easy to get to. Tickets cost 15 soles and aren't included in the general pass. Queues were long and lots of tour groups. This is a Catholic Church built over and around some Incan structures. All in very good condition and worth a visit.",
          "We went here as part of our City Tour of Cusco, interesting temple with lots of history, this place used to be covered in golds. Lots of good paintings. Well worth the visit.",
          "Located in Cusco and originally built by Incas as the House of the Sun (Coricancha) or temple in honor of Inti. It is said plates of gold adorned the walls and the masks and jewelry on Seven deceased Incas (rulers). Like the cathedral, the Spanish built over the Coricancha",
          "The place is full of history and you can see the Inca structures as well as the Spanish Convent that was build on top of it. It is part of Cusco\u00b4s UNESCO world heritage, definitely worth a visit!",
          "Across the street from our hotel, this monestery-Inca temple sits on 10 acres. There is a fantastic modern art museum on the top level - the workers there were so bored, we saw one of them bring a taser in, and amused ourselves as they \"zapped\" each other and ran from room to",
          "We initially thought it a large church and were confused when the national policeman told us it was a temple when we asked. You have to enter the cloister to see the Inca temple hidden inside. Expansive site offers the opportunity to admire both the temple and the church",
          "We visited the Convent after returning to Cusco from Machu Picchu. The old Spanish exterior of the Convent is beautiful and so is the courtyard. The green garden area also looks amazing in the sunshine. There are a nice collection of paintings and history about the Incan",
          "We visited this place as it was included in our packaged ticket for Cusco ruins (the Boleto Turistico Del Cusco is130 soles for 7 days), but I found the museum could be better curated, and we could have better spent our time visiting other ruins.",
          "Remarkable stonework and significant history in this amazing place. Felt much more formal than many other sites, but in line with its importance.",
          "The entrance fee is 15 soles just over \u00a33 ( $4.50US) on the lower level you have Inca walls and convent courtyards upper level art gallery",
          "This place is a Dominican church built on top of and around several Quechan temples. It's interesting to compare the precise structure of the \"barbarian\" Quechan walls with the ugly rock and mortar construction by the \"superior\" Europeans.",
          "There is an entry fee associeated with this, its about 10sol. Do recomend to visit during the night it is nicelly iluminated",
          "The convent was purposely built on top of holy Incan ground, once all the gold was conveniently removed. The tour does not shy away from this history, and is well worth the time to see the original Incan structure that the convent built over but has since been recovered. While",
          "Catholics will enjoy this very much and anyone interested in the history of the area. Some pre-Columbian relics remain.",
          "I came with a group tour pretty fresh off of my overnight flight, so admittedly I may not have been in the best frame of mind to tour any building. Our guide did point out the interesting Incan walls that are still standing inside of the church and gave us some history about",
          "This place is amazing, mainly due to the massive stonework below. It's impressive how precise and extensively these stones were worked and adjusted together.",
          "Takes some imagination to work out the five temples on this site. However it was interesting to see the little that was not destroyed like the cornerstone which helped the structure together.",
          "It was the place where we learned how the old relegation was integrated into the new and how, in some subjects, the Quetchua (headed by Inka) were scientifically evolved. Undoubtedly worth a visit.",
          "This was absolutely amazing and interesting place to visit. We especially liked the paintings and sculptures . The way it was built to escape earthquake damage was also interesting",
          "I came here as part of a tour that saw multiple sites. Having a tour guide explain the history of the structures made the visit much better, but this is definitely a stop you can skip. We had a very short visit and this is NOT a place I would recommend by itself.",
          "Once covered in dazzling gold, if Cusco was the navel of the Inca Empire, this temple was the center of the navel. All the temples honored different facets of the cosmos including the sun and moon with beautifully accurate windows and alcoves. The center of the courtyard, is the",

          "We visited here as part of our city tour. The church was built over the Inca Sun Temple. The history was very interesting about how the Incas used to sacrifice a young girl to the Sun God asking for the sun to return at the winter solstice. Our guide explained the history very",
          "Beautiful attraction with lots of history to be gleaned from it. Overwhelming European influence so do not expect (for lack of a better word) authentic illustrations of Peruvian culture or style. It is very much so an exhibition of European style.",
          "Visited as part of the Cusco city tour, I felt a bit sad while inside. You can see that it is a mixture of Inca ruins on top of which the Spanish conquistadors built a religious edifice. At every corner you can see the destruction they brought upon South America. Beautiful but",
          "I was a bit unsure of the visit, fearing the religious Spanish overlay of the Inca past would be a bit underwhelming,. But it was excellent, there are some magnificent ruins inside, a couple of which are breathtaking.",
          "Taken with a guide it was fascinating to learn this church is constructed upon Inca ruins. There are man th preserved ruins which have survived earthquake and show the knowledge of the natives in being abld to build to conditions. You will not fully appreciate the place without",
          "Our wonderful guide from 'Alpaca' took us through this historic place. Lots to look at but we wouldn't have enjoyed the visit nearly so much without a guide explaining things to us & telling us lots of stories!",
          "I didn't realize this was such a hot spot. I was just wandering and saw the crowds in front. Naturally i was curious. 15soles to enter, you're immersed with some incredible history, art and religious artifacts. Also has a beautiful square. I ended up surrounded by many",
          "We were on a tour of Peru, and the best way to see this Cathedral is with a tour guide that knows Inca history. He explained how this Colonial city built in the17th century atop existing Inca foundations,creating one of a kind architecture. and how the Cathedral, the Santo",
          "This is an interesting building. Originally build as an Inca temple it was later turned into a Catholic Church which utilised some of the existing architecture. It was really interesting to see how the two different architectural styles exist in the same building",
          "Great place for discover the mix between spanish and Inca people. I really like this place. It can be done within the city tour. I recommend.",
          "Fascinating history touring the Convento de Santo Domingo and the Templo del Sol. Of particular interest was the Inca architecture.",
          "Maybe I liked it more because I could take pictures. This is the place where Spanish and Incan cultures cane together as the Spanish brought stones from the mountains above after destroying the Inca city. They built temples here to woo the locals into converting. Beautiful,",
          "Visit this attraction not for the convent but for the Incan treasures inside. The edifice entrance fee does not cover a tour and therefore you are left on your own to understand, interpret and decide whether you like the museum exhibits inside. In our case, we read in advance so",

          "We went with a guided tour and our guide was fabulous which made a huge difference here in particular. We saw very little signage, which would make a self-guided tour difficult. The site is an excellent location to see original inca/pre-inca stonework contrasted with the",

          "The Inca ruins are nothing spectacular here. The church is quite nice. There's a bit of information at the start to set the scene, and some art exhibitions upstairs",
          "This site was included in one of the attractions of the city guided tour. Most of the tour operators will have this on their itinerary. Although the museum may be elaborate with some well preserved artifacts, the crowd and the lack of proper guidance makes visiting this place",
          "Oorikancha (Koricancha) the Temple of the Sun was one of the holiest sites in Peru. It was destroyed by the Spanish in the 1530\u2019s. The convent of Santo Domingo was built on its ruins. There are a lot of interesting things to see in both the convent and the surrounding grounds.",
          "We initially went the the museum with our tourist pass and decided to go in after. We opted against having a tour guide and wandered around. It might have been interesting to have a tour guide to understand further the history of this building. It had lovely artifacts on display",
          "Provides some good insight into Inca culture and later colonial Spanish culture in Peru. There's some very good information about Incan Pantheon and how they structured their empire that you will definitely keep in mind while visiting other places.",
          "I think this museum was lame and a waste of time. Not enough English texts and just 5 rooms? These objects could be easily placed in the historic museum.",
          "This is an important site in Cusco to visit as the Koricancha Temple in Incan times was related to the solstices and equinoxes and blends Spanish colonial culture with Incan masonry. Plus, the site is used for the all important and much anticipated celebration of Inti Raymi,",
          "We did not come to Qorikancha as a stand alone site. Rather it was a the first part of our guided tour (Condor Travel) that also included Sacsayhuaman, Puka Pukara among other important Inca sites. Qorikancha offers a glimpse of the way the Spanish Conquistadors treated all",
          "I elected against a private tour, so this rating is based solely on the lovely agriculture and ambiance of the place. I have a general knowledge of Qorikancha's history thanks to the internet, and the low entrance fee makes this historical monument well worth the price of",

          "This monastery is important because it rests on top of the holiest place in the Inka empire, the temple of the Sun. When the Spanish conquered the Inka, they destroyed most of the Inka complex (but not all), and built their Dominican church right over it. The site has been",
          "Built over the top of a former Inca temple this is a fascinating clash of cultures and religions. Inside are the remains of the Inca temple which also surround the cloister. Go with a guide or a good guide book to get the most of the meanings. They are also many Christian",
          "Built on the ruins (NB: destroyed by the Spanish invaders!) of the Inca's Temple of the Sun, what remains of the Inca architecture is a sight to behold. And some of the modern interpretations of the Inca beliefs and calanders are worth studying.",

          "Qorikancha was an incredibly important religious site for the Inca empire and learning about it can be fascinating. I wouldn't say it's overly impressive from an architectural standpoint or awe-inspiring in it's grandeur, but it's the historical significance that makes the place",
          "I did not buy the 10 day tourist ticket, so I paid the 15 Sols to enter. It was worth the money. I spent about 1.5 hours here. Very nicely done and somewhat eclectic with modern art exhibit upstairs. It was interesting to see the Incan foundation, mixed with the Catholic church.",
          "Worth a visit, you get a great impression on how the incas build their houses/palaces. Too bad, the roman catholics destroyed so much.",
          "Right in the middle of Cusco, you can't miss this spot! It's got peaceful gardens for yoga or walking around, historical interiors to learn about Cusco. This was one of my favorite spots! You do have to pay an entry fee ... and be prepared to be asked if you are interested in an",
          "This was a temple of great importance to the Inca. Each stone is smooth, and built almost like stone legos. We hired a English speaking guide who really helped us to understand what we were seeing. We only looked at the Inca Ruins, we did not do the museum, but it was well",
          "Convento de Santo Domingo is really a must-see. It is so fascinating to see the foundation of the Inca temple and this great Spanish convent built onto it. The convent itself is also really impressive. It is as if the Spanish wanted to outbeat the Incas in regard to",
          "This museum was greatly overshadowed by the vastly superior Pre-Colombian Museum. There were not many original artifacts, the English displays were awful and it smelled like a sewer inside. The displays seems really out-dated. Go ahead and skip this one.",
          "The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who with this structure as a foundation built the Convent of Santo Domingo. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site. Inside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco",
          "If anything go to the museum just to see the mummies and the elongated skulls. The whole museum will take you 30 mins to go through and its totally worth it. I found most tourists are in Cusco for more than a week so spend 130 Sols and get the tourist ticket which gives you",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "The museum was 10 soles to go in, which is fine. However, it needs a lot of work. A lot of the artifacts are mere printouts. It is unclear what in there is original and what isn\u2019t. I think it has a lot of potential but needs to be updated.",
          "Really affordable and interesting visit but it would be great to have more languages translated from Spanish",

          "Really interesting museum with all the Inca history. Highly recommended.",

          "Good place to understand Inca culture and all history behind.",

          "A little tired in places but fascinating. We spent a good couple of hours here",
          "Old fashioned museum with poor organisation and labeling. Very limited English information. If you go in expecting to gain a good understanding of the Incan civilisation then you'll be disappointed.",
          "For 10 soles (about $3), a great bargain. While some exhibits are just pictures of artifacts, there is a plethora of ancient pottery and tools. The museum traces the original local tribes through the Incas and the Spanish conquest. It is \u2026",

          "This is a must go museum in Cusco.  The collections are telling great stories on the history and life of the Inka.",
          "Great museum that focuses on the Inca and pre-Inca history of Peru, really interesting with Gabriella who was our guide, she explained everything extremely well - almost 2 hour guided tour and did not want any money at the end (she would not take anything at all!).",
          "Very interesting.. enjoyed it.",
          "This museum has the biggest pottery collection I've seen. It also has a nice breakdown how different groups of people lived in different areas. Lot of jewellery and clothing samples as well and how those clothes were made, you can also see two ladies in the yard making them. Plus mummies and skulls",
          "Very interesting but there are more alike that should be visited",

          "Very old museum. But nice collection of pots and vases.",
          "Surprisingly large museum tucked in at the top of Cusco. Most exhibits are also explained in English but not all. Does focus on the Inka heritage rather than the Spanish conquistadors. Probably the best to visit in Cusco.",

          "Nice Museum with many exhibits from the time of the incas, before and after. A model Maccu Piccu. Sadly not all the information is translated into English... That would have been really helpful. Also good would be a better overview which cultures lived where at what time... / at the same time...",
          "Not have enough information for Inca history, here is only a commercial place , not a real museum. Avoid here",
          "Nice food, good prices",
          "For 10 soles it's good value, but it's definitely not worth any more than that. Lots of pictures of artifacts instead of actual ones, and poorly translated signs.",
          "Good Museum - need a little mantaince though, has a lot of features that were not working on my visit but are not necessary for me to recommend not to go. I did not get a travel guide but I will highly suggest for you, entrance is 10 soles per person.",
          "Very interesting",
          "Fascinating place to visit.",
          "As seems to be common I couldn't take any photos inside. That being said it's a stunningly complete look at pre-Incan to Incan history and world be excellent for school kids and any visitor interested in hour this great empire rise and fell",

          "Boooring. Very big exhibition, but in the old fashion museum style. No interaction, without a guide you will go through it and won't remember anything.",
          "Interesting historical artefacts going back to pre Inca times. Convenient location just off Plaza de Armas. Worth a visit if in Cusco.",
          "Interesting museum with good organization of information to provide introduction of Inca/pre-inca culture to visitors. English presented. Highly recommended for those interested to know more Inca culture.",
          "Old school little museum.  We really loved it.  Especially liked the mummies and learning bits of history I didn't know.   I learned a lot and appreciated the museum's laid back vibe in a lovely old building with a central courtyard.",
          "The museum is very rich with a variety of artifacts.  You're not allowed to take photos inside. Staff focus more on supervising you as a guest rather than enhancing your experience. ",

          "Not very interactive neither informative. Mostly old artifacts with little or only information in Spanish",
          "My motivation to visit this place was to learn more about the culture of the Inca\u2018s. However I was very disappointed for the following reasons:\n1. less than 50% of the artefacts had explanations in English\n2. there was almost no information \u2026",
          "Not a lot of in English explained, could be more interactive",
          "So many detailed exhibits and well organized, clean and very very educational",
          "The museum I enjoyed the most in Cusco, with interesting displays and photos. 10 Soles admission, definitely worth it.",

          "A very simple museum with very limited explanation on the displayed objects.",
          "Not Inka only, but very informative",

          "We had a private tour, and it was very interesting :)",
          "It was a little smaller than I expected, but I appreciated the galleries. My recommendation is to go on some tours and hear some of the stories associated with the various locations before you visit. That way you can tie the information \u2026",
          "Great pre colombine collection",
          "Nice collection.",
          "A startlingly thorough and impressive collection of all things Peru and Inka/pre-Inka culture including artifacts, writings, recreations, and more. No pictures allowed which is a bummer, but this was the best museum we went to.",
          "Interesting muzeum, despite in old style",
          "If you are not a Spanish speaker do not waste your time here. The museum starts off with English translations, but as soon as you get to the INKA section of the INKA museum, the English translations stop.",
          "Excellent museum and it's huge. Best thing there's English translations!",
          "Wasn't told that photography was not allowed, despite entering the museum with a large camera hanging from my neck. Half way through my visit I was stopped by the security guard and told to delete all my photos!\n\nI am not a user.",
          "Really good museum with lots of information both in english and spanish about all cultures living in the Inka Empire area. Entry 10 soles",
          "Worth the admission price. Real mummies on display",

          "Worn out museum, bad facilities",

          "Unless you're into pottery, I wouldn't recommend it.",
          "Insightful museums to better understand all South American civilizations. In particular Inka /qechua. ",
          "We found an English-speaking guide in the museum and spent 1.5 hours with him.  It's our 1st time here,  so we were all ears and eyes.  I think our attention made him very enthusiastic about his interpretation,  so we learned a lot about \u2026",

          "This place is awesome! They have lots of great artifacts, relics, mummies as well as models of Inkan ruins like Machu Pichu. Definitely worth the visit, I found it more interesting than the more highlt touted Museo de Arte Precolombino. \u2026",

          "Lot's of info about the inkas (to be honest inka was the name of the leader, and the people should be named the queshuas)",
          "Not very big, but worth a visit!",
          "Phenomenon.  I learnt a lot about the Incas here.  A very important museum",
          "A poor museum. Lots of pots without much else. No historical narrative and little background to the artefacts. English plaques stop half way.",
          "Not bad but expected more",
          "It is an excellent museum! It has plenty of artifacts and helpful information that provides an overall undestanding of the inca and pre-inca cultures. The dioramas and models provide a better approach of how life was back on those days, and \u2026",
          "Awesome artifacts describing how the incas built Machu Picchu (without the help of the aliens) worth the visit if you already went to Machu Picchu. 10 soles ",

          "The Museo Inka is a great place to go to really understand the evolution of the Inca empire and all of the different cultures/people that preceded it. Don't be fooled by the small size of the museum - there is a LOT of stuff here and you could spend hours if you really wanted",
          "This is another colonial mansion being used to house a modern-day museum. It's 5 minutes' walk from Plaza de Armas. It houses Inca and pre-Inca artefacts, but the layout of the place and the display-cases are very old-fashioned & need some renovation. Information boards are in",

          "We had feelings that Museo Inca was an important attraction with very interesting artifacts. The museum located close to the main square of Cusco - Plaza de Armas",
          "Have plenty of Inca archaeological finds in this museum; inca pots, weapon, clothing and also how they buried their dead. Worth a visit.",
          "Too bad you can\u2019t take pictures in here. Lots of pottery and utensils. Some good models of what things used to look like most of the things have English explanations so it it easy to understand. The mummies were the best.",
          "Recovering from altitude sickness, I decided to take a leisurely day in Cusco. Our Peruvian guide recommended I find the Inca Museum. I am so glad he did. It was a beautiful display of the history of the Incas tools, pottery, and artwork. It was located on the second floor",
          "This is a very worthwhile museum. We spent quite a bit of time here and learned a lot. My only criticism is that the English translations on each display were in pretty poor shape and were not very complete translations. I felt myself wanting to volunteer to correct the grammar",
          "Another must see attraction in Cuzco. We were able to learn more about preincan and incan culture...",
          "We had read previous reviews of this museum and our expectations were not very high. Once there we were pleased we decided to visit. This museum has a very extensive collection of Inca artifacts that we enjoyed. I particularly enjoyed the 3D scale models of Moray and Machu",
          "This museum is packed. We appreciated the old school 3d model of Machu Picchu as it really put it in perspective. Do not miss the \"music man\", ground floor between the weavers and the bathroom. He has a fantastic selection of whistles and pitchers that he delights in showing off",
          "This is a great place to visit to learn more about the Inca culture. Pots and other artefacts, woven material and lots more. The descriptions for much of the exhibition are in English and Spanish which is good but the English petered out after a while and then thankfully",
          "This was like the 'Louvre' of Inca and pre-Inca cultures. I'm not a big 'museum person', but if you do only one this is the one to do. Endless textiles, sculptures, daily use and sacred items, elongated skulls, mummies.....it was an incredible and moving experience.",
          "Only a small museum but I came out knowing more about the Incas than when I went in, so I considered it worthwhile. The are plenty of English descriptions for the artefacts. Admission is included in the Cusco tourist boleto.",
          "They have a few good pieces, the house holding the museum is pretty, but is not well maintained and the exhibition leaves much to be desired.",
          "This is the best museum to know about the Inkas, everything is very well preserved, you can even see mummies! Only for 10 soles, it is great!",
          "We visited this museum when we had a free day before starting the Inka Trail. It was interesting and provided a good history of the museum. At the beginning, most of the signs were both in English and Spanish; however, as you got farther into the museum the English versions",
          "We were told that you had to take a guide to visit Museo Inka by the receptionist, it was not possible to tour by yourself. We were told that the guide is not paid and is a volunteer. We decided to go ahead anyway. We were surprised to find that when we started our tour, it",
          "Most museums in Cusco were really average when compared to the Larco museum in Lima. If we had known about Larco before (much better collection and description) then we would have avoided the visit to this museum.",
          "Not my favorite thing we did in Cusco. Most descriptions are only in Spanish, and if an English audio guide is available, we were not told about it. We were hoping to learn more about the Incan culture after visiting Qoricancha, but this was a let down.",
          "While there are interesting artifacts, the graphics are poorly done. Also 98% of descriptions are in only Spanish. Luckily we went with our guide so learned a lot. This museum was not nearly as well done as the two others we visited in Cusco.",
          "I went to this museum on the recommendation of my Inca Trail tour guide. I loved it! I spent a good 2-3 hours going through the relaively small museum, but there is a lot to take in and absorb. If you are visiting Cusco to do the Inca trail, definately pay this museum a visit",
          "We wanted to learn about the Inka people and Maccu Picchu prior to our Inka Trail hike and just wanted to see one museum to give us an overview. This museum is quite old and a little underwhelming. The first half of the tour is okay, it has English and Spanish signs and",

          "I definitely recommend this museum to anyone interested in Inka history and/or artifacts. They even have mummies on display. Most exhibits are written in both English and Spanish, there are a few in only Spanish as well. Well worth the 10 soles entry.",
          "The Inka museum has some fascinating artifacts that really showed how the Inka's lived. They only accept Sols so bring Peruvian cash. One thing I would like to see is more Inka history even though some artifacts may not exists. Replicas or representations would be great!",
          "I was quite disappointed with this museum, I expected more about what they got up to with of the stories of how they expanded so quickly and even how they disappeared so relatively quickly. This really shows the story of previous tribes leading up to the Incas and their",

          "Nice little Museum. Loved the artifacts on display. Couldn't take any pictures but it was a nice visit. Don't need a lot of time to review. They also had weavings & such on display and for sale in a part of the building. Amazing work! Also a couple vendors selling weavings and a",
          "It\u2019s really hard to find Inca artifacts in museums here- most museums are Spanish influenced. This museum is great because it has some really old Inca artifacts and shows a really good time line through the Inca period- from 5000BC. There\u2019s even mummies! Great displays and worth",
          "The museum is housed in a beautiful old mansion that I wish they provided some information about somewhere. The collection is quite impressive, but displays are amateurish...sometimes looking as though they were written with a Sharpie marker, others poorly lit. Unfortunately",

          "Dark, dank, and not well displayed. This museum didn't impress us much. We only went because it was included in the tourist ticket, but they really need to add some life to this place. It was dull and hard to enjoy.",
          "This is a charming little museum nestled in the heart of the historic district. Admission is very cheap and the museum covers a great deal of Inca and Pre-Inca history, lots of interesting artifacts. However, as many reviewers have pointed out, there is a lack of English",

          "This museum was #1 on my list to learn more about Inka history. And its not part of the Boleto Touristico. In respect of exhibits it was bery good., both in terms of number, quality & descriptions in English & a thorough overview of how Inca life developed & thrived. My",
          "It's simple and straightforward with rich information on various parts of the Inka history. I learnt a lot. Some of the displays have English some don't, but there were plenty that I felt I could get a good grasp of some of the history. The women spinning wool and weaving in the",
          "We decided to visit the museum on a rainy afternoon on our last day in Cusco before going onto the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. S10 entrance fee. Lots of artefacts but not a huge amount of written information but still useful and interesting. Allow yourself at least an hour",
          "Not bad if you have some idea of Peru\u2019s history. Some English placards, enough to make it worth S/10 and an hour or two.",
          "We just got back from this museum and it was a bit of a disappointment. Everything seems yellow and old, barely any explanation about the pieces. For example: \" this is a ceremonial knife\" and then no explanation what use it had, what kind of ceremonies etc. This kept on going.",
          "This museum provided good information displays (in Spanish, not much English), explaining the range and components of the Inca. I was finally able to see a quipu! Photography of exhibits is not allowed. I spent about 45 minutes there, and liked that they had artisans working",
          "I advise doing this tour or taking a visit to the museum after you have done the Trek. This way you will have basic knowledge and understanding of the exhibits and the people that you are about to learn about.",
          "The Museo Inka was great to visit, especially after visiting many Incan sites in the Sacred Valley, Cusco and Machu Picchu. Simple displays, and many without English translations, but if you can read Spanish, very educational.",
          "We visited several of the museums in Cusco and liked this one the most. Interesting rooms with displays of different eras. Explanations were in Spanish and English. Interesting for adults and children.",

          "Anyone interested in the Inca History should visit this museum, the \"British Museum\" in presentation it is not! But there are lots of interesting artefacts, maps, photographs, and you will not fail to leave without a better understanding of this wonderful ancient culture, many",

          "Two rooms downstairs and a series of rooms upstairs. Civilisations ranging from Nazca, Moche, Chimu, Incas. Several of them unknown to me, so it is an educational visit. Sadly not a lot written in English but you can guess the dates from the Spanish script. Worth a visit, after",
          "This was a small museum that took only about an hour to go thru. There was a lot of pottery. We saw some of the same things that we had seen in other museums so if you have covered some in Lima, might not need to visit this one.",
          "This is a small simple museum that captures the Inca experience very well. Not a ton of artifacts but gives you a good introductory vision into the Inca life.",
          "To understand Cusco's role in the Inca Empire a visit to this museum is a must. It explains pre Inca history and the rise of the Inca Empire. It has many fascinating artefacts that show Inca artistic flair. It also shows the role of the Spanish Conquistadors in the history of",
          "This is a very small museum with not much to see. Nonetheless, in a city so very filled with attractions exemplary of European force and influence, I made it a point to visit and highly recommend this museum for a glimpse of indigenous life and history.",
          "This is not a fancy museum. The presentation in some cases is shocking by Western standards but I enjoyed the simplicity. With two floors to visit you'll surely find some of the pieces stunning. The dioramas were very interesting and I particularly enjoyed the collection of",
          "We visited this museum in October 2017 and really enjoyed seeing the artifacts from the pre-Incan and Incan cultures as well as the dioramas of several well known archaeological sites. The museum has some information on each artifact and the culture it came from, but doesn't do",
          "Bit of an outdated museum now, but there's information on the Incas to give you an overview plus lots on pre Inca civilizations. Make sure you go to tiny instrument section/shop on the ground floor - there is a man selling traditional instruments but he'll do demonstrations too",
          "I spent 2 hours there on the first day I arrived in Cusco and wandered by myself. This museum helped me a lot in knowing the history and culture of Inca time Peru thoroughly and immediately, especially that the main square had no obvious clues of finding any Inca ruins if you",
          "Visited here in September 2017 and felt the place could do with a facelift. The whole place had a tired feel to it and a lot of the exhibits had Spanish only explanations. While they certainly have some great stuff it could be better laid out.",
          "Located near the main square, this museum is worth a visit if you have an afternoon free. This place closes down at 6:30 PM so plan an early visit. The general tourist ticket will not provide you entry. I think the entrance fee is around 10 soles. The museum is pretty big with",
          "A nice museum with both pre-Incan and Incan artefacts. Also some information about the Incan sites around Cusco region. Informative signs in both Spanish and English (some of them were faded and hard to read though). The building itself is quite beautiful as well. We wish there",
          "For only 10 soles, it was worth wandering around the Inka Museum especially if you are aroind Plaza de Armas. Most artifacts had explanations in English and Spanish. No pictures are allowed in this museum.",
          "I went there on my own via taxi to the main square. The Museum looks small from the outside, but loops off into side buildings that you can't see from the outside. From what I can tell, the items start off from the newest artifacts first, and the Inca historical items more",
          "This museum looks completely unimpressive from the street, but it is very interesting inside. The collection does not have vastly valuable objects, but it does a great job at telling the history of the various peoples who have inhabited the greater parts of Peru since about",
          "Thought the museum was just fair. Some displays were interesting and the highlight was the mummy display. Otherwise, I didn't find it extremely engaging.",
          "Check on the days and hours the museum is open, we had to return on a different day. The museum has some great history on the Incas and some wonderful artifacts, it is worthwhile going. The set out is in an old building and needs to be a bit more organised, but it is",
          "Nice museum. 10soles to enter. Most of the exhibits have information in both Spanish and English. Some of the English signs were quite faded though which made them difficult to read. Recommended if you're interested in looking at Incan artefacts and reading a little bit more",
          "The collections here are excellent, with many past cultures included with Inka artifacts. It is a long, and interesting journey, with some of the mummies that were sacred to the Inka culture tastefully preserved. No photographs allowed, to keep damage to a minimum. Signage",
          "Museo Inka has some really interesting information about the Inca Empire where information is available, but some of the exhibits don't have much other than artifacts that are labeled only in Spanish. It's neat to see people making traditional textiles in the courtyard. There",
          "The lighting was poor and the presentation of the items on display was poor and disappointing. I went in expecting to learn more about the Incas and went away disappointed..",
          "This museum is located in Plaza de Armas , right behind the KFC restaurant. It is self guided, inexpensive (10 soles or about $3.25) and a great way to get a quick overview of Incan culture. I walked through it in about an hour, and didn't miss anything. Most of the",
          "Very cool history about the region. Unfortunately, if you don't speak Spanish, it is often difficult to get good information. The English information cards often don't make grammatical sense, and many displays don't have any English plaques. The arrangement was a little odd, not",
          "This museum has the biggest pottery collection I've seen. It also has a nice breakdown how different groups of people lived in different areas. Lot of jewellery and clothing samples as well and how those clothes were made, you can also see two ladies in the yard making them.",
          "Museum is fairly small, we visited for about an hour while waiting for the rain to stop. The highlight is the mummies.",
          "Old fashioned displays in a nice courtyard building. Translations into English minimal. Really needs updating. No English speaking guide available. We wanted to understand how the Inka built their buildings, and roads but we learnt very little.",
          "This museum is a real geek experience if you are actually interested in Inca history---the displays are very basic and no-tech, but the content is there---serious artifacts and solid historical narrative. Visiting the museum was a very informative pre-amble to a trip through",
          "Cheap entrance fee 10 fee alot of peru history that just doesn't talk about the incas. If you're in Cusco you definitely have to go.",
          "A small, slightly dated museum that displays inka and pre-inkan archaeology. The museum is charming and excellent for situating ones-self into pre-Hispanic history, including cultures that predate and help define the later Incan empire. Museum has bilingual signs in English and",
          "The exhibits are in disarray and so tines not in chronological order but it you a great idea of the Inca empire. A must at the beginning of the city tour.",
          "This place should be free. Probably great for kids but definitely not worth the 35 soles. Very amateur museum that is poorly set up.",
          "Visited this museum with my husband. It's only small but gives you a good idea of the history of Inka. You can watch the Inka men & woman making clothes etc & there are souvenirs you can buy. Most of the displays had an explanation in Spanish & English of what was in the glass",
          "This little museum could use some funding but we very much enjoyed the content and appreciated the context it offered for our further Inca experiences. We found especially interesting the portion of the museum that talked about the assimilation of this group into the",
          "I have traveled to Cusco fro the last five years and am always looking for the authentic and you'll find it here with the people",
          "This museum is well worth a visit as it gives great examples of the history of the Incas as well as displays of artifacts from the Pre-Inca empires. We were very pleased to have visited this tour before our trek to Machu Picchu as it allowed for us to have additional knowledge",
          "Many artifacts from the Incas and pre-Inca civilizations. There is a great deal of pottery, jewelry and weapons from these periods. Close to center of city. Interesting way to spend an hour or two.",
          "I visited the Inca Museum last week, and enjoyed the artifacts, particularly the mummified bodies! The courtyard hosts superior local crafts people. For only 10 S, this is worth it!",
          "The museo Inka is a very nice museum with pre Inka and Inka collections. There is a lot of pottery, but also textiles, weapons, juwelery and a few very nice mummy's. Well worth a visit!",
          "I visited this museum before I went on my 2 day Inca hike, and it gave me a good background of the Inca, and the story behind some of their rituals and celebrations. Definately worth the 10 soles entrance fee!",
          "This promised to be an amazing experience but it left me feeling a little sad. Its obvious it requires some type of sponsorship to bring the presentation of what are beautiful artifacts up to scratch. There seemed to be no guards, no additional information, just not what I",

          "There were so many times during our half day tour that when I asked our guide 'where can we see.......?' that she answered in the Museo Inka that we decided to visit. Although a little old-fashioned in some respects, this museo gave a clear and full explanation of the place of",
          "I went to this museum while in Cusco on recommendation by a taxi driver there. It had fairly little content for the size of the topic. It was clean and quiet and safe though. We went through the whole thing in maybe a half hour and were fairly bored the entire time. I was",
          "We had hoped that Museo Inca would give us a strong background in Inca history prior to exploring many of the sites in the Sacred Valley. Unfortunately, the displays are a bit lackluster and very much lacking in English descriptions. No, I'm not one of those who thinks locals",

          "Visited this museum on a free day in Cusco. It had a good amount of artifacts to see and was very interesting considering we had just done Machu Picchu and Scared Valley. The mummies were really cool too. The only thing was that the english translations were a bit off or just",
          "Only costs 10 soles to enter and well worth spending 2 or 3 hours there. Not a big museum but with some interesting exhibits that were mostly well presented. The history of the Inka is set out quite well and provides an easily understood description of the civilisation. Located",
          "I'm intrigued by mummies, and after hearing and reading about how they were preserved, I wanted to see them .... the mummies in reality were \"worth a thousand words\". Also enjoyed talking to the proud artisans who were painting and carving Peruvian products.",
          "If you're a history buff, and like learning about Inka culture, it's worth a visit. A good way to kill an afternoon and learn something at the same time. The mummies are actually pretty cool.",
          "Thought this place was just OK. Lots of very dated displays and most of the information is in Spanish. Didn't end up staying too long. If you go, do check out the mummies, though. They were hands down the most memorable thing in the museum.",
          "It cost 10 soles for entry. There wasn't that much information on the exhibits or much introduction either (there is slightly more spanish description but not much either). Not very comprehensive as I can only read English. I would skip this, but it was still decently",
          "If you are going to spend the time and money to visit, take some time to learn about the culture and the people. The museum is not large but a lot of information that you did not learn in your history class. It's inexpensive and only one block off the plaza. Expand your mind.",
          "Although this museum has great potential it is really poorly curated. It comes off similar to a high school history project with dioramas and placards that are computer printouts pasted to construction paper. We came really wanting to learn more about the Incas and pre-incan",
          "Our favorite thing here was actually watching some people do traditional weaving. Definitely consider this an optional thing to do in Cusco.",
          "If you have the time check it out, but dont go out of your way. Its not very polished, not alot of description, and alot of the same stuff. Stone carved tools etc. The mummies are the coolest thing for sure.",

          "This was an unexpected place that really helped to fill in the spaces after going to Machu Pichu. The displays linked the info I was given by the guide and the short films were great. I had a few questions after the tour and this museum answered most of them. I did not plan to",

          "This museum contains incredible displays of artifacts from various pre-Inca cultures, as well as Inca artifacts. That said, I think it should have a different name. I also has a model of Machu Picchu, as does the Machu Picchu Museum. The only problem I had with the model is",
          "After trekking the Inca Trail I was keen to visit the museum and learn more of the history. I loved the old photos, the 3d model of MachuPicchu was fascinating too. Sadly most of the explanations were in Spanish which I'm not fluent in. I would have enjoyed seeing more clothing",
          "I think this museum probably had some interesting artefacts, but I'm not sure as there wasn't really much information about what we were seeing - not even in Spanish. Not worth the money unfortunately.",

          "The museum was interesting with many historic artifacts. Not everything had English labels, but enough did to keep it clear.",

          "This was an unbelievable and overwhelming visit. My two recommendations: - Visit only if you are really interested and amused of the Inka culture, what they did and how they lived. - Take a visit guide, a tour guide. Only this way it really worth the visit. You can ask for it",

          "This supposedly has the largest Inka artifacts in the world. We had a private guided tour, but the museum doesn't boast anything extremely impressive. It was just a ton of rooms with pottery and tools. No videos or unique displays. Children would be extremely bored. Unless you",

          "We came here on a free morning and it's a very average museum. Loads of pottery and textiles but it won me over on the fact we saw a humming bird in the garden area, the staff were friendly and the mummy exhibit with 8 skeletons was very interesting. Worth a visit if you've",
          "We are not huge museum people, but this was worth a short visit. Just off the main square, not too large, well laid out with good information displays.",
          "Jam-packed with artifacts of pre and post-Incan artifacts, among many other things. Honestly, I would high recommend doing before Inca Trail and/or Machu Picchu",
          "It's close to the main plaza and should be great but it must have remained untouched and unrenovated since the conquistadores left. Poor and patchy translations and displays often not annotated at all. There is a wonderful display of mummified burials worth the admission alone.",

          "This museum isn't part of the Boleto Turistico but it is worth the visit, just one block from the Plaza de Armas. A model of Machu Picchu site will help you to track your visit and have a better understanding of it. Mummies and the Inka treasures are awesome!",
          "We were on a tour, so our guide provided commentary. The museum provides an overview of the history of the area. If you have the time it is worth a visit.",
          "Interesting museum with. Artifacts and displays. We didn't have an English guide, but it was still worth going to see. I recommend it.",
          "Killed an afternoon in here whilst acclimatising in Cusco. The Museum itself is basic and I honestly wouldn't have known what I was looking at if I hadn't hired an English speaking guide - I recommend doing so! It's a nice museum with some nice pieces and real Inca mummies!",
          "This museum isn't going to rival any museum in the 'western world' in terms of preservation or interaction, but if you have just arrived in Peru it is an excellent introduction to the ancient civilizations which roamed the area many years ago. The displays are very basic but for",
          "After being on the Inca Trail, our guide told us that this was the museum to see (we only wanted to go to one museum). For the price (a few $US), this was a good overview of the Inca culture and a few pre-Inca civilizations in Peru. Only a few exhibits have English",
          "Thankfully, we had a guide that took us through the museum and explained things to us. There aren't very many English descriptions and the displays are pretty rough. They do have some artifacts. Perhaps the coolest thing is a hanging display of an Incan bridge and real mummies.",
          "When I got there I asked about tours in English and the lady at the desk seemed a bit unsure but said there'd be one starting in half an hour so I was happy to wait. Come the time for the tour there was no one else around and the people at the desk still seemed a bit unsure",
          "We visited Museo Inka today. There are a number of museums in Cusco and we decided to start with this one. Before going to the museum, we purchased the general Boleto Turistico assuming that Museo Inka will be included in it. But none of the museums are included in the Boleto",
          "Save your money. There was little to see. The displays that were there were few and really rough. No typical museum polish. There were more vendors than information.",
          "We had a nice visit to Museo Inka our last day in Per\u00fa and were glad we made the stop. We especially enjoyed the large ceramics displays.",
          "This museum explains about the civilisations before the Incas as well. Although quite plain and low tech it is really interesting and I definitely recommend a visit. 10 Sol to visit, very reasonable.",
          "It was a nice stop at this museum, because can introduce you to a different history or more realistic of everything you see when visiting the main ruins. The artifacts that you can see at the different rooms transport you to a time which you would love to experience again. Do",
          "But presentation is a little inconsistent. Most of the exhibits are in Spanish and English, but not all. I'd say about 20-30% didn't have English placards. Outside of that, the pre-Inca items are solid. The Inca items are very strong. I didn't fully appreciate the",
          "This Museum is a must see when you visit Cusco and the Sacred Valley. I recommend going before heading to the archaeological sites and get the context of what you are seeing. Pay a little extra for a private guide and if your lucky you will get Yenny. She is extremely",

          "This museum had some great exhibits, but some of the labeling was worn out and the place seemed to need some attention. The staff was enthusiastic, so I concluded that they didn't have any money to spend on upgrading some of the explanatory material.",
          "A good place to learn about various pre inca civilizations s well as the incas. Also check out the various crafts men around the courtyard. You can learn how to make and decorate pottery. Watching the weavers is fascinating. Don't pass up the chance to visit this museum.",
          "Guides recommended this to us as the \"best museum\" in Cusco. Whether that's accurate or not, we did enjoy our visit and felt we really learned something. Forewarned is forearmed and we knew from reading reviews not to expect holograms, 3-D videos, or inter-active displays. It's",
          "We spent a couple of hours here while it rained. While the artifacts are wonderful, sometimes the displays leave a little to be desired. Many don't have English translations and the lighting is not good in some places. I think with some angel investment, this little museum could",
          "At first I was thinking this museum was going to be a bust after the two rooms on the ground floor. But once I was upstairs, I was happy with the extent of the collection. They had nice sets of vases and pits as well as craft items and weapons. It was a great place but no photos",
          "Last day in cusco here. Found it very fascinating with history , incredible Cotton and wood dolls , clay pots of all sizes and decoration and even on display some recreated models of areas where inca lived in certain areas, must go visit!",
          "This museum is out of date, and doesn't have English translations for every exhibit, but if you love history and want to learn more about the pre-Incan & Incan empires this is a really good place to stop. And it's only around 3 USD! Prepare to depend on reading the",
          "At the last moment I found myself with a few hours available and engaged a private guide for a walking tour of Peru. Our last stop was the Inca Museum. I was surprised it was virtually empty because it was full of interesting artifacts. I would highly recommend a visit to help",
          "Definitely old school. Not all of the displays have an English translation. I did enjoy the music room. It was great to hear the sounds produced by the instruments. Very impressive. The room was located on the first floor at the end of the tour.",
          "The Museo Inka is one of those museums that seemingly hasn't had much done to it since it was set up - but for me, at least, that was part of the charm. I was particularly taken with the model of the Sacred Valley, having been too ill to tour it when I stayed in Pisac. The",
          "It's a very old-fashioned museum. It has some good objects, but it's one of those places that could use a refresh. If they took some objects off display to lessen the clutter and improved the interpretation it would be a much better museum. Right now it seems tired and neglected.",
          "We found this museo very interesting! We wish that we had a guide as we think that we could have learned a lot more - we listened in on a few groups as we passed by and it was very interesting. A lot of interesting artifacts and history to be seen and learned.",
          "Worth doing, only 10 Soles and 1 hour is enough. The open areas had an open market with some very very good artistic items.",
          "A great museum to visit especially on a dreay day. Lots of artifacts. Unlike most of Peru vendors are not overly aggressive",
          "I'm fascinated by the Incas, and so the opportunity to explore this dedicated museum was hard to resist. At 10 Soles, it is a bargain. However, the museum is not as well kept or as informative as you would expect in the heart of Inca territory. Gold artefacts are simply placed",
          "This museum isn't included in the tourist ticket but at only 10 soles it is very good value. Three memorable artefacts / displays for me were: the huge pots / vases on display, the 5 mummies including a mummified child and an example of the Inca messaging system - the rope",
          "Rustic museum with pottery, tools, & historical timeline from Pre Inka through Colonial times. Worth the cheap admission for a leisurely history of the region.",
          "We took a guide to show us around. The lady spoke good English and obviously knew her stuff. The cost of admission was 10 PEN and only a tip is required for the guide. There were several in our group so we gave her a good tip. Definitely worth a visit but if you take my advice",
          "It was really nice to go to this place after seeing the ruins in Sacred Valley. Very educational and helpful to imagine the ruins and the Inka people / culture.",
          "This museum details the history of the Inka culture in South America. While not very large, it has interesting displays of Inka tools, ceramics and settlements. Perhaps the most interesting exhibit was the mummy room at the end. Worth spending an hour or so while in Cusco.",
          "Inside the museum, you mostly see many kinds of rocks shaped differently depending on the tool, many vases, and some reprensentation of inca ruins. The only thing worth seeing are the mummies and the end of the museum. No pictures allowed anywhere though.",
          "This is a bit sized museum that we really loved. Old school. Loved the mummies and it primed my son for a 'Mummy' exhibit here in LA with Peruvian and Egyptian mummies. I learned a fair bit and enjoyed the museum's low key vibe in a lovely old building.",
          "We learned alot about Inkas by visiting this museum.. History of Inkas was outstanding and a bit..As long as you stay you learn more and more...",
          "I went to this museum primarily because of its location near the central square but also because I had gotten interested in the Inka culture having been to Machu Picchu. I was impressed by the exhibits and the information that was provided. I also was impressed by the local",
          "Has a potencial but there is not enough writings about the arts, some objects we had to guess what they were about and why they could be at the museum",
          "This was very interesting introduction to the Incan cultures. Most of the museum was laid out in chronological order, ending with post-Spanish influences. Many of the artifacts did not have descriptions, and if those, only about half had English translations. We probably would",
          "This small and quaint museum is right in the heart of town and full of interesting details and exhibits of the Inca. It also has quality vendors in the courtyard where unique items are for sale that you don't see in the shops and markets.",
          "The museum itself is fairly cheap to enter and has lots of exhibits but that's it. The whole museum had a feeling of a \"school project\", in that descriptions were mounted on card, some handwritten, poor lighting, about half translated into English (badly) and some things",
          "I learnt so much about the Inkas and how they came about and ended by touring this museum with our guide. The guide is optional but I think she brought the museum to life with 2 hours of background information and stories all in perfect English. Did you know potatoes were jumped",
          "Although it has some good exhibits, this museum looks dingy, unloved and uncared for. I would not bother going there.",
          "This place is very poorly kept, not clean, poor lighting in some areas, it is just bad compared to all the other places you have around. Go some 300 meters and you find the Museo de Arte Precolombino by far superior. Very sad.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Inka Museum more than any other attraction in Cusco. We had a guide (paid with a tip), Marcelo. He was absolutely superb and we learned an incredible amount about the history of pre-Incans, the Incans and the Spanish invasion in the space of an",
          "Interesting collections. This museum does well in spite of its limited budget. Museums such as this are important and need to be supported by tourists. It had some very talented local potters ( with beautiful items for sale)and weavers too.",
          "This museum has an extensive collection of artifacts and is full of Inca history. If you like museums, you'll enjoy it. But if not (like me), I wouldn't bother. The facilities are lacking. The bathrooms are disgusting and don't flush. Note: Entrance fee",
          "Jars, mummies, jewelry, misc articles from the day of the Inca. If you are a fan, this is the best museum to go to when here in Cusco. It is a nice primer before heading on to Machu Picchu and other sites. It is not expensive, maybe $5 at most if I recall correctly. SO worth",
          "The entire museum is quite interesting, I thought. The highlight for me was seeing women weaving intricate throws and rugs by hand in the central courtyard. They have about 1000x more patience than I could ever hope to have. You can buy alpaca products right there -- good",
          "We spent a good hour here on a recent rainy day. Whilst decor is a little dated, it's charming and quaint. There is enough English information to satisfy the gringo and plenty of Spanish info too. We enjoyed looking through the artefacts. Take your time to browse, museums are",
          "Built on an old Inca foundation, this museum, also known as the Admirals Palace, was once one of the finest colonial homes in Cucso. Today, it houses an extensive collection of pre-Columbian artifacts, Inca jewelry, pottery, mummies, ceramics and textiles. This is a must see for",
          "Out of all the museums, I chose this one because it interested me the most. I had a very bad first impression upon entering this place. I was already having a hard time with the altitude, but after the uphill climb to this museum, I sat on a bench in the courtyard to catch my",
          "A great little museum, presenting Pre-Incan and Incan cultures through really interesting and informative displays. Plus there are some great stalls selling high quality textiles and ceramics from skilled artisans! A great stop and a nice hour or so well spent!",
          "This is a very interesting tour...for you will meet with the inka mummies and old ancient artifacts from everyday life, kinda you were in Cairo looking for pyramids, well...Peru too has its own pyramids.... advice to you all, visit them",
          "I left the museum with a feeling of visiting a primary school level presentation. Most of the artifacts were not there and only their picture were displayed. The descriptions were printed with many typos and grammar mistakes and manually cut and glued next to the pictures. The",
          "The museum has many excellent artifacts from the Inca era and laid out in a reasonable manner, but some over-arching information would have been nice, as well as some higher quality information materials.",
          "Few visitors to Cusco retain enough time for the museum, which are not included in the mainstream. It's a shame, because even small museums have something to show you.",
          "I thought it was cool. Maybe too little information in english though. They had real mummies in there!",
          "I've read mixed reviews about this museum on TA. We really enjoyed wandering around it for a couple of hours & found it informative. Perhaps because we had already visited some other museums outside of Cusco & read a book about the Spanish conquistadors (The Last Days of the",
          "with Cuzco being the inca capital and with so many artefacts available I had high hope for this museum. sadly it is a disaster. it makes no sense chronologically, full of inconsistencies, the displays are badly lit or set in a way that it is difficult to see them. translations",
          "This museum is close to the Cuzco square in a high hill. They have different areas where you can understand better the Inca culture and you can see nice centenaries pieces. In the courtyard there are some women doing hand made work with the tipical stuff from Cuzco.",
          "After having visited Machu Picchu I went to the Inca museum hoping to get more insights into Incan history, culture, society and technology. Unfortunately, the museum has only few Incan artefacts on display (which are poorly explained in English, but Spanish tags are also not",
          "I came here on my first day at Cuzco hoping to get some more historical information about Cuzco and the Inca civilization. However, even though the museum covers a wide range of history etc , I can't say the museum was really informative and we went through it pretty quickly.",
          "We only had about an hour here but could have spent more. We learned a lot about the Inka culture and saw many artifacts.",
          "We loved this museum for one main reason - our free (tip only) English speaking tour guide Joel! We asked at the desk if there were guides and were assigned Joel. He led a wonderfully informative 1.5 hour tour. I cannot imagine walking this museum without a guide, it would not",
          "The items on display were not of the highest standard and not particularly well curated. However, it is still interesting and for $2 admission what can I say?",
          "This museum covers a wide range of pre-Inka as well as other Inkan ruins besides Machu Picchu. I picked a beautiful rainy day and spent hours just wandering through the museums many rooms and artifacts. A good plan would be to visit and gain some history before going to other",
          "Old school museum, lots of old pottery, very little useful information. If you want to learn more about the Inca culture you probably have to go somewhere else...",
          "I walked through the museum on my own. Most displays had descriptions in English. It looked like they were starting to update some exhibits and narratives.There are some amazing objects and human remains on display here. No photos! A must visit if you want context, chronology,",
          "With all of the amazing Inca Ruins in the area, this museum needs to amp it up a few notches. The layout and exhibits are dated and everything needs an overhaul.",
          "Some good exhibits, but it's a bit like one of those places you were dragged around on a school trip, sorry, as everywhere in Peru, the staff were lovely, but the museum needs some sponsorship and a refurb.",
          "Extensive display of Pre-Inca and Inca artifacts with descriptions in Spanisch and sometimes in English. Maps and paintings give context to what you see. A good start to get to know the Inka better. Some prior knowledge comes in handy.",
          "Took 4 kids to this museum. There are professional displays from pre-Incan to modern day Peru. There are artisans that will demonstrate their art and talked with the kids for 15 minutes.",
          "Housed in another gorgious building the Inka Museam is well worth a visit on a rainy day. Not as impressive as the Pre Columbian art museam amd not as well laid out it is still impressive. I liked the mummies !",
          "this museum keeps many inka artifacts, textiles, mummies, ceramics and have nice colonial staff. it is a good place to spend some time with friends and family.",
          "This is an excellent museum but to get the best from it engage a guide (payment is by tip). Our guide, Jenny, added greatly to our experience of the museum, explaining much more than could be ascertained from the explanations accompanying the exhibits (most of which are in",
          "We had a great time at the museum. From all the museums we had the opportunity to visit, this was by far the most interesting one. It had all the history told in details. Don't miss the room with the music intrument's presentation. Incredible!",
          "I am a student in Canada very interested in world indigenous cultures. This museum gave a fantastic overview of Inca and pre-inca societies, mostly from a cultural-material point of view. I learned a lot about the progression of culture in Peru, it helped fill in gaps of what I",
          "There were some interesting artefacts here - lots of ceramics. The English translation is patchy which spoilt the experience somewhat. But a good introduction to Inca and pre-Inca civilisations.",
          "Very excellent collection of artifacts and most had information in both Spanish and English. Worth a visit.",
          "This museum is very thorough, and you could easily while away a good portion of your day here. Unfortunately, when we went in, no guides were available, so we did it ourselves. You can tell they're working on expanding English language signage, but until they're caught up, I",
          "An excellent museum telling the history of the region up to and including the Incas Good displays and interesting artefacts",
          "A friend of mine who lives in Cusco said that this was the only museum worth visiting so we stopped in for a visit. It is fairly inexpensive. Only 10 soles per person. They had a large number of artifacts dating pre-inca to the Spanish inquisition. The information is in both",
          "I loved this museum and its historical exhibits. The Incans left us little documentation, so this place affords us the optimal insights into the background and practices off these brilliant people. If you wish to know more about the Incans and Peru's indigenous people, this is",
          "Many interesting things but badly organized, with sparse text and explanation and presented in a very old fashioned way. Nevertheless worth seeing for some interesting pieces.",
          "I enjoyed this little museum for the explanation of the history of the native people of Peru before and after the Spaniards came. There are actually mummies in the museum, which are very interesting to see. The last sections of the museum need to have English translations put",
          "Very interesting thing is the way of counting with string ties. I think I managed to understand it. There was a group of elementary school children in the museum and I was surprised by how carefully they listened to the teacher.",
          "This is an interesting and a bit quirky museum. It has some very nice pieces, including a mummy display, two quipos, and some nice pottery. I found the dioramas a bit hokey. You can go through it in an hour or less, and the entrance fee is reasonable.",
          "This is a very handy place for learning more about the Inca Empire, and is useful to do before going out on a tour. There's lots of interesting artifacts and items of note. 2 hours is probably a good amount of time to schedule for it.",
          "The displays were quite nice and I really enjoyed watching the craftsmen and women at work. My favorite was the man with the traditional musical instruments - make sure you find him. I wish more of the signs had been in English as well. As a photographer, it was frustrating to",
          "The museum takes about 2 hours to see. Good exhibits of different tribes incorporated into Incan society. The English explanations are faulty but understandable. Don't miss the weaver or the man who makes and plays the water flutes(?) - he's located in a small room on the first",
          "It was cool to learn about the ancient history of the Inkas in this little museum tucked away in the Plaza de Armas.",
          "At the end of our two week stay in the sacred Valley we topped off our knowledge about the amazing Incas at this fine place. be sure to get a guide. Our 1 hour tour was led by a very knowledgable young man who was studying at an institute to be an official guide. We were to pay",
          "Lots of interesting objects but not well presented. The second floor has lots more but the English captions ran out about halfway through. The whole place needs a major spruce up especially the toilets. The claim that one would see what Bingham found at Macchu Picchu seemed",
          "This museum of Inca history was well worth the admission price (low cost) and time spent. Glad that we took this in.",
          "Definitely go check out this museum that has more of a historical narrative perspective, guiding you through history. Also the artisan/vendors in the hallways, have great quality products at reasonable prices with marked prices.",
          "The museum is small but the tour guide provided by the museum is very great. It is tip based. Everything about the Inca is here so it is definitely a must for those who want to learn more about the Inca.",
          "This museum needs some serious revision because the English translations are dire and frequently non-existent, and the quality of the exhibition is tired. What struck me as interesting was the 3-d macquettes of places like Qorikancha, Sacsayhuaman and Tambomachay as they would",
          "This is a great museum, gives a good idea of the incas which you don't get anywhere else, plus pre inca s time. Alohas Peruvians demonstrating craft and weaving.Not all in English but understandable and very cheap to get in- about \u00a32",
          "Nice museum, exhibitions shows a lot of inca history, must visit in cusco, should spend more than 2 hours.",
          "Weird, hidden, quirky, cool, you will get from it what you put in and to whatever level your attitude is. A lot of missing information, but it it more like a working collective than a \"professional\" museum. Some displays are better than others. This is a place to wonder around,",
          "The Inka Museum was fantastic. We had just finished the 4 day hike on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and had an afternoon to kill before flying back home so we decided to go to the Museum. The price is 10 soles per person but is well worth it, They have a beautiful collection",
          "This was a fantastic museum. A little rough around the edges and only about 2/3 of placards in English, but for the price this was a great find with excellent artifacts, information and exhibits. I really enjoyed going after my trek as it put some of the things our guide told me",
          "This is an interesting museum with an inexpensive entry fee. The diaramas give you a good perspective. The chicheron diaramas in particular. It is better if you speak Spanish as the information towards the end of the circuit is not translated.",
          "Worth a visit, it was very interesting with lots of information and artifacts to look at. It was very cold inside the main exhibition area which hurried us along a bit. Other reviewers were not so complimentary about the weavers and flute players, we didn't have any issues with",
          "Besides being very interesting and very inexpensive, this place had the best as far a local arts and crafts. When we first arrived in Puno, the local art that caught our eye were the carved gourds. We had several days in Puno so we didn't want to buy the first thing we came",
          "My family and I went into this museum to kill some time but found it very educational and interesting. It was fun to see the artifacts and history of the Incas. We are happy that we stopped in.",
          "It is very cheap so I recommend you go anyway if it is not perfect, there u can see lots of antiques and a few old letters.. maquetes from inka places... etc just missed a but of the history of the inkas! I wish they tell us more the history, specially about Machu pichu!",
          "The museum has an interesting collection and tries hard to tell a story putting the exhibits in cultural context. It's fascinating but a bit threadbare. Some of the tableaux look a bit tatty and old which is a pity. The number by number trail through the rooms somehow",
          "We'd been told that this was the best museum in Cusco but we were a bit disappointed. We finished the whole museum in 45 minutes. Many of the exhibits lacked detail - for example, a collection of Inca mummies which told us nothing about where they came from, the mummification",
          "This is more a \"crafts\" museum than fine art. Outstanding examples of weaving, gourd carving (all for purchase of course if you're into that). DON'T MISS - the demonstration of the Inca ceramic whistling animal water jars, made for hunting, which when filled with water, emit",
          "Of all the museums in Cusco, this one was by far the nicest. If you can only make one, this is the one to choose.",
          "Interesting and big museum where you learn a lot about the Inca culture but some things are a bit unorganized. Maybe they are renovating and it will be better afterwards?",
          "Great place to spend a couple of hours learning about the Inca culture. From pots, arrow heads to mummified bodies in the foetal position, it's a great learning curve.",
          "The museum was recommeneded by our tour guide as something to do in the morning that only cost 10 soles (3.00) and easy access. We started the tour of the museum, but didn't make it far until we were captivated by a demonstration of Inca Water Whistles. It was an excellent show",
          "Very awesome pieces of Inka, pre inca and Colonial Spanish. Cheap entry and discount for students. Mummies too.",
          "The museum is a little corny but if you push past to the second floor you will find Inca mummies, and some neat furnisher, paintings and books from the 1500s when the Spanish first made contact.",
          "This is a nice museum with lots of old pottery and Inca artifacts. Most of the information is provided in English. The art section is truly amazing.",
          "A very good museum in Cusco to learn more about the Incas: their culture, their history, how their empire was formed and many other things. Since many of the things to do in Cusco revolve around Inca culture, I highly recommend visiting this museum so you can understand and",
          "Reasonably priced with a lot of information. Maybe not as polished as some museums, but focuses on content. Highly recommended.",
          "I went to a few museum here in cusco and this one was the best one. They offer an free audio guide and there is information in all objects displayed.",
          "artifacts, timeline, easy to follow with English translations a little dated n terms of the style of museum however easy to follow and learn about the indigenous groups in peru MUMMY section is the best!",
          "We did not want to leave Cusco without visiting a museum. There were several to choose from. The Inca Museum was 2 blocks from the main square. It had an admission fee but it was insignificant (10 Soles I think). There were many artifacts that predated the Incas. They were",
          "This is a great hidden gem. The museum takes you through the stages of indigenous population in Peru, all the way to colonial times. Anyone who's doing Peru in detail will realize quickly that, because of conquest, not all the artifacts are in one place. This musuem does a good",
          "We were told about this quaint museum by another traveler and we were pleased that we had gone as it filled in a lot of gaps in our knowledge. It is all built around a central courtyard where local people are making and selling Peruvian goods. Very cheap to get in so there is no",
          "The cost of admission was only 10 soles, and I wonder if they should increase it (at least for foreigners) in order to put the money into updating the exhibits and lighting and documentation. That said, there was an amazing amount of history here---well worth seeing and",
          "I love the rich history of the Inca and there's plenty of it at the museum, including pre-Inca cultures. The artefacts range in size and quality, beautifully presented in most places. However we were disappointed in the lack of consistent English translations on the majority of",
          "It's worth the money, but as an english speaker it was a bit lacking. The first half of the museum contains information in both english and spanish, but about halfway through it seems like they gave up. The english slowly gets worse and worse, and then just stops and",
          "There were lots of nice historical artifacts in the museum but after the first room or two there were no longer any descriptions in English. They did have a tour guide which, had we known, we would have asked for one. It was very interesting and well worth the feel we paid.",
          "Good price: 10 soles. Extensive exhibits & collections. Excellent gift shop with art and artisan wares. Also artisans demonstrating and explaining their handicrafts, such as weaving and gourd carving. No photos were allowed, but I was free to linger as long as I liked to take",
          "This was the only museum my partner & I visited in Cusco and we both enjoyed it. Quite a large building, close to the plaza with lots of well laid out exhibits and information in English. We spent a couple of hours wandering through the various rooms and found lots of",
          "I wish I could have taken my time to read every single thing in the museum. It's quite big, I say you should plan on spending a good two hours there.",
          "Costs 10 soles (no student discount). Has lots of artifacts from the Inca times, but nothing quite stands out about the museum. It's in a good location (about one block north of the Plaza de Armas), but many of the artifacts can also be found at Casa Concha, the museum about",
          "This is a good place to visit as it adds another dimension in addition to the stone bundling ruins that you see at Machu Picchu and in the sacred valley. We enjoyed the music demonstration of the musical instruments. The museum has a lot of potential, and clearly can be",
          "lovely courtyard and inca architecture, located down one of the lanes off Avenue Sol leading to market places and small street restuaurants",
          "It appears that the curator may be an amateur, but we don't know what they have to work with. They charged only 10 soles per person which is nothing. So my suggestion is to raise your prices and work on the presentations. Your location is great and the building is impressive.",
          "Had some extra time and popped in to this museum off the main square. Not well publicized but had great artifacts and info about the history of the area. Most exhibits also in English. Also had craftspeople doing live demonstrations of weaving, etc.. I consider it a must see for",
          "This museum is near the main plaza. Only 10 soles to visit with a guide which is optional. This museum shows the history and culture of the Inca and pre-Inca civilisations. Also has great displays of traditional weaving and old ceramics of the different regions. Highly recommend",
          "First of all the discrimination towards gringos as always: Foreigners have to pay 10 soles and Peruvians only 5 soles. Already the first hall of the museum looks like nothing. There is no introduction to the Inka culture at all. It begins with some random ceramics, then goes",
          "This museum is worth a visit to get some context for other visits in the region, but you've probably seen more Inca artefacts in U.S./UK museums. The interpretation lacks a narrative - it's fine if you want to whizz round in 30 minutes or so. The macabre skeletons will impress",
          "See an extensive collection of artifacts from various cultures that inhabited this region throughout history.",
          "In terms of presentation, there were a lot of ceramics and a few dioramas. Seeing the mummies will make your kids forget that you dragged them through the museum. If you can imagine a creepy mummy display, this would be it. The museum did have weavers in the courtyard weaving",
          "There were a lot of artifacts, but it was poorly structured and described. Their was no consistency in the English translations and some had none at all. The rooms were set up oddly as well. The only thing that was cool were the Inca mummies. It was not expensive, so no big",
          "The Inca Museum is better than expected! My friend and I were bored wandering around so we decided to give the Inca Museum a go and was pleasantly surprised that it's quite a gem. It's cheap to go in and we were expecting much but there's quite an interesting range of exhibits",
          "This museum was very interesting and I can say much better then the cosa concha machu picchu museum. Although the building conditions aren't the greatest. It seems most museums in Peru are exactly the same wether in Lima or Cusco. So get use to it and just enjoy the great",
          "Somewhat disorganized, and a bit tired, but the exhibits are quite informative, and help visitors gain an impression of the way the Inca lived. By accident, we stumbled upon a room full of musical instruments that emulated the calls of various birds, and we bought one from the",
          "Small museum whose facilities are rapidly deteriorating. There is a clear lack of investment within the facility itself. More importantly, a guard kicked me out for no reason whatsoever. The guy stormed over from 3 rooms away and tells me to \"avanzar\". I didn't know why he",
          "If you have been before in Lima, at Larco Museum, it is not supposed to add any useful contribution to your past knowledge of Inca history. Otherwise, you may visit it to have a small sample and a glimpse of how life and culture among Incas were before travelling to Machupicchu,",
          "Incredibly informative and very important museum in Cusco! We loved learning about the authentic culture and religion of the Peruvian people, without the Christian/Spanish influences that are confusing to the people and tourists alike. The museum has an impressive collections of",
          "I went to this museum but it was really small. Apparently I discover there was a free guide when I was leaving but when they sold me the tickets didn't mention a thing. I don't think there were labels in English, which could be an issue for tourists. They have real mummies on",
          "You cannot miss this museum, as it informs you about the Incan culture. They have models of different sites and explain the way of life, tradition and food of this culture. Artifacts are not missing. In the base floor you meet a guy that demonstrates ancient instruments and you",
          "For 10 sol it is worth a visit. Quite a range of exhibits weaving demonstration in the courtyard. It gave a good insight into the history of the region",
          "I started out trying to each of the descriptions for the display in this museum but I ended up just admiring each of the pieces. Some things were a little confusing but overall I liked looking at the artifacts. There was an area upstairs where they had a miniature Machu Picchu",
          "If you make it to one museum, visit this one. Large expo and several show rooms. Informative. Spend 2-3 hours here.",
          "This museum offers a curious mixture of earnestness and total confusion. While they obviously have some interesting artifacts, they are poorly presented and there is no clear story. Besides having the worst dioramas I have ever seen, they also have an odd assortment of cases",
          "While in Cusco we had the chance to visit the Inca Museum We did it with our g-adventure group people.. (not organized by g-adventure but with the people on our tour). Because there were so many of us they gave us a tour guide. We took a 1.5- 2 hour tour. Saw many different",
          "This looks great from the doors you walk in but when you pay you start to second guess the decision. It ends up being worth trip. The museum shows the history of the entire area from pre-Inca to Spanish conquest. We enjoyed getting more of that historical context about all the",
          "I'm genuinely shocked that anyone can honestly give this more than 2 or 3 stars. On the plus side there is a decent collection of artifacts; pottery, tapestries, etc. But other than that there is very little else to recommend it. Some of the reviews mention the lack of",
          "I was just walking by and thought I'd go in. It was only 10 soles and so worth it. I didn't realise at first how big it was and underestimated how much time I needed. I was there for 2 hours as the captions were in English so I was able to read everything. I'm not a big",
          "This museum is quite cheap but has interesting content. It is not huge but they have quality artifacts. Explanations in English are spotty. Certainly worth a visit and possible the best museum in town.",
          "A truly amazing collection of artifacts were displayed and explained. On the day we visited the fee was 10 Soles (about $3.50 U.S.). Museums of this quality could easily command much more. Don't miss it!",
          "The Inca Museum is a must visit for any Inca lover. I would say visit it after you visit any of the number of Inca sites in the Cusco area. After visiting all the Inca ruins and seeing how empty they are, its nice to see what was stored in the Inca sites. The museum doesn\u2019t",

          "There were several upsides to this museum: in the courtyard people were weaving incredible designs in the Inca fashion, and some of these were available for purchase. Throughout the museum there was also opportunities to buy other things, like Inca-style pottery and little",
          "An excellent museum worth the small entry fee. Many rooms, well maintained and impressive Incan pieces and very informative.",
          "Fabulous overview of Incas Life and all the works, buildings, pottery and items they created all those centuries ago Great entrance price Worth a look!",
          "This added terrific context to our previous 5 days exploring the Inca ruins in the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu by providing insights into how they lived, how the empire was built, household implements textiles, art forms, pottery, etc.",
          "Being Cusco the amazing city it is, and with so many Inka sights, do not waste a minute visiting this old fashion museum. Tacky, cheap, not organized, it feels like a bunch of stuff put together without any order just to take some extra money out of the tourists... Probably",
          "Entry is only 10 soles (~$4 AUD) so we decided to have a look. Only about a third of the items had descriptions in English so we moved quite briskly through the exhibits, used the toilet, and then left. Maybe for those who understand spanish it would be ok, but even then the",
          "A great way to get an overall view of the Sacred Valley history, culture and artifacts. The Pre Inca pottery was stunning. I wish I had more time to visit, it was fantastic. In the courtyard 2 traditional weavers were doing scarfs and blankets, very special!",
          "Do not let the name fool you, this is not a must see. Maybe if you are only in Cusco, but if you are stopping in Lima anytime during your trip, go for the Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Arqueologia y Historia del Per\u00fa. The Inca Museum is not very well curated and items usually",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "Make sure to get the extremely professional audioguide that's included for admission. The small church doesn't look like much but the entrance fee is well worth it, and if you get the more inclusive ticket, you also get into the Cathedral and some other buildings as well.",
          "This church is worth a visit to see the old wood carvings. This is an old colonial church. You have to walk cobblestones streets to get to it, but it is worth the trouble. Cuzco has prettier churches than most of the other cities we visited in South America.",

        "wiki": "The Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas (Church of the Society of Jesus) is a historic Jesuit church in Cusco, the ancient capital of the Inca Empire, in Cusco Region, Peru. It is situated in the Plaza de Armas de Cusco, the city center. It is built on an Inca palace. It is one of the best examples of Spanish Baroque architecture in Peru. The architecture of this building exerted a great influence on the development of many Baroque architecture in the South Andes. Its construction began in 1576, but it was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1650. The rebuilt church was completed in 1668.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the original church was begun in 1576 on the grounds of the old Amarucancha, palace of the Inca Huayna C\u00e1pac that was one of the largest palaces surrounding the main square of Qosqo (the Inca capital). The grounds of this palace were given to Hernando Pizarro. Years later the property was purchased from the heirs of the conquistador by Diego de Silva y Guzm\u00e1n and his wife Teresa Orgo\u00f1ez, who donated it to the Jesuits after their arrival to the city in 1571.\nIn the year 1650, the main church was devastated by the earthquake. This allowed the builders to undertake, the following year, a more ambitious reconstruction. Despite the protests of the council, the work continued according to plan, and the church was reinaugurated in 1668. It was built by the Flemish Jesuit and architect, Jean-Baptiste Gilles (Hispanized name was Juan Bautista Edigiano), the works on the fa\u00e7ade were directed by Diego Mart\u00ednez de Oviedo, Oviedo is very likely to follow the plan provided by Gilles.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe main facade is a classic example of the Baroque style.The Jesuit college in Cusco was dedicated the Transfiguration of Christ, and the high altar features a painting of the Transfiguration attributed to the Jesuit Diego de la Puente. The most notable piece of art in the church is a painting depicting the wedding of Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda de Loyola, the nephew of Ignatius Loyola with Beatriz, the great-niece of the Inca ruler Tupac Amaru.In the church, there are paintings and sculptures by Diego de la Puente, Marcos Zapata, and Cristo de Burgos.\n\n\n=== Portal ===\nThe portal, a \"altarpiece\" type, presents towers of medium height and its stone walls have been carefully worked. Its towers appear divided into two sections, leaving the lower one free of all decoration, while the upper part has two \"balconies\" with projecting ledges. At the start of the bell towers, a large flown cornice joins the towers to the front, curving in a trilobed form on the top of it. Finally, the tall body of the towers has a square plan, its portholes, the octagonal dome and the pinnacles, around, define the typical profile of the Cusco bell towers.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nSimilar sumptuousness is seen in the carved tribunes and the rest of the altarpieces, some of which belonged to the defunct Templo de San Agust\u00edn. The collection of sculptures and paintings within are noteworthy. The church exhibits, under the choir of the main altar, works of art by Marcos Zapata and his assistant Cipriano Guti\u00e9rrez. On both sides of the main gate of the main altar, around the alabaster windows (huamanga), there are two canvases that represent the life of St. Ignatius of Loyola: in one he is healing the sick and in the other he is victorious over the heretics and schismatics of the Reformation.\nThe interior also hosts two paintings of great historical value. The first, located on the northern wall, is The Wedding of Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda O\u00f1as de Loyola with Do\u00f1a \u00d1usta Beatriz Clara Qoya, which depicts the union of this Spanish captain, nephew of St. Ignatius of Loyola (who is founder of the Society of Jesus) and apprehender of the last Incas of T\u00fapac Amaru, and the \u00f1usta of Inca lineage, daughter of Sayri T\u00fapac and therefore niece of T\u00fapac Amaru. This noble indigenous woman, Beatriz Clara, was heiress of the Lordship of Yucay. Their mestiza daughter, \u00f1usta Lorenza de Loyola Qoya, was the first Marquiss of Santiago de Oropesa, the nobiliary title that granted claim to all the properties of the Yucay Valley and the surrounding Oropesa, with the power to rule them with complete independence of the local authorities. This daughter married Juan de Borja y Enr\u00edquez de Luna, son of St. Francis Borgia. Also on the canvas are T\u00fapac Amaru and Sayri T\u00fapac, who, like the princess, wear native clothes; behind them appears the achiwa, a kind of umbrella made of multicolored bird feathers and used only by the Inca. The second painting is on the south wall and represents the wedding of Beltr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda de Loyola with Teresa Idi\u00e1quez, daughter of Juan Idi\u00e1quez and Magdalena de Loyola.\n\n\n=== Chapel of San Ignacio de Loyola ===\n\nThe chapel of San Ignacio de Loyola is located to the south, and adjacent to that is the central location of the modern-day National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco. That building originally served the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola, which was part of the University of the Transfiguration, created by Pope Gregory XV in 1621. After the Jesuits were expelled in 1767, the site served as the army barracks and prison of Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui (T\u00fapac Amaru II). At the end of the 19th century it housed the Society of Artisans. The chapel is small and austere, with a single nave built in stone, and has a more sober portal than that of the main church. It is currently an exhibition hall.\n\n\n=== University ===\n\nNext to their church, the Jesuits built their own university: the University of San Ignacio de Loyola, now the premises of the National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot. Paradoxically, the two institutions were major rivals at the end of the 17th century. The stone fa\u00e7ade dates from that time, but its treatment is much freer than that of the main church.\nIts composition, like an altarpiece, is adorned with a profuse padding and with blind, purely decorative windows. Its wide hall, crowned by a dome, is unique in Cusco. The inner cloister, which contains an austere stone arcade, served as a model for others in the city. It houses the Museum of Natural Sciences.\nThe Seminary of San Antonio de Abad was founded in 1598 in a building on the Calle de las Nazarenas (today the Hotel Monasterio); In 1692, through a document given by Pope Innocent XII, the University of Saint Anthony the Abbot was created on its base.\n\n\n=== Chapel of Loreto ===\nTo the left of their church, the Jesuits built this chapel for indigenous peoples between 1651 and 1654. Like the previous one, it is set further back from the square than the main church, and its sober decoration does not compete with the main building. The interior of this chapel does not retain anything of the original decor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nImages of the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, Cusco and paintings at the MAVCOR website of the Yale University.",

          "I'm going to be honest, I was not excited to see this cathedral. I had my 17 year-old daughter along and was prepared to drag her through the entire tour. Boy was I wrong. I have been to the National Cathedral in Washington D.C, and St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome, and also",
          "This church is absolutely gorgeous. I thouroghly enjoyed my visit, and I even came back for mass later. The main alter is just spectacular, and the gold pulpit as well. There is so much interesting history surrounding the Jesuits in Peru, and it was great to see their church so",

          "First - the name of this church is Templo de la Compania de Jesus en Cusco. It is NOT 'The Company of Jesus Church'!!! Someone at Trip Advisor needs to correct this! Now, on to the church itself... such a fantastic building, views over the Plaza de Alma and the largest altar",
          "This church was gorgeous and majestic. It is jaw dropping and can not be forgotten. But also this church's attendants were nice and accommodating. They did not charge entry, were friendly, and allowed you to access areas of the church that went above and beyond what they needed",
          "The inside of the church is breath-taking and you will find so many things to look at on the walls and ceiling that you might miss some. They provide you with a brochure that gives information on each of the pieces of art and upstairs offers the best view of the Plaza de Armas.",
          "A bit upsetting to see such splendor, but it's undeniably lovely and interesting -- not to be missed.",
          "I went to mass here (they charge you if you enter as if a museum). It was very moving. The church is beautiful and I'd encourage to leave a donation for reparations.",
          "This is a lovely church located at the plaza. I attended a mass here on sunday and the people are warm and respectful.",
          "One of 2 church's located at Plaza de Armas. No camera inside. The painting of \" Last Supper\" featured a CUY /Guinea Pig int e center.",
          "Loved this church it had more of a sense of peace about it. Really loved the way I sat at the alter looked up and they'd painted Jesus in 3 d looking down . All built from inca stone well worth a visit",
          "Worth going it's quite old and historic, no entrance fee during mass at 6pm. No photos allowed though enjoy.",
          "It costs 5 soles to enter this over-the-top church. It has the largest altarpiece in Peru which if you look closely has Andean features (corn for example) built in. That's one cool thing about this church--it combines religion and history and an Andean version of Baroque style.",
          "We paid a few bucks to enter this church was hard to swallow (paying to go in a church), and hired a guide who introduced herself when we walked in. It was actually nice because there was so much we learned in this visit about Peru, the church and all the details. You can see",
          "I really enjoyed this Church. You can climb to the towers and take pictures of the Main Square of the city, listen the priests singing and appreciate the interesting portraits on the walls. A special thanks to Maria, that works there and has explained about the main altar.",
          "You can get a free audio guide when you enter the cathedral, which is very instructive. It covers a lot of details in the cathedral, in particular, Cusco school of paintings. I felt educational after the visit, understanding how south American cathedral adapts its setting to",
          "Impressive Altar, the tallest in Peru. Don't miss the view from the towers going up to the Choir, both sides are worth it.",
          "They charge admission and you can't take photos, even without flash. Ridiculous. We decided not to feed this beast.",
          "I have never visited anywhere so rich in history before. It was so beautiful and after learning more about it I appreciated it more. I would definitely recommend a tour guide to show you the sites of Cusco. We were only there a day passing through. I wish we would have had at",
          "I went here for Sunday mass during my recent visit to Cusco. A beautiful church to visit .The church is very centrally located in the main plaza",
          "This is even better inside than out, which is saying something! The only drawback is not being allowed to photograph inside, but it is possible to buy postcards.",
          "This whole plaza was worth the visit, it is ringed by quite amazing buildings, the architecture was pristine considering the age. I did have a lot of trouble with the altitude, so needed to stop often, but there were benches placed around the plaza, so just took it easy.",
          "Incredibly serene, wonderful sense of Peruvian faith. Church was in full use during our visit, nice to know tourist attractions are still used by the normal people.",
          "We paid a local tour guide in the church to give us a guided tour, and learned a lot about the history of this church. A bonus is that you can climb some very narrow stairs into the towers at the front of the church, and get a unique view over the historic market place.",
          "The church is smaller than the main one across the street... but there is peru information counter, handicraft shop which I recommend by the real Alpaca sweater or scarf here!! and there is museum and sometime have coffee/coco exibition!!",
          "Although Cusco has a lot of churches I did like this one a lot and I think it was worth the entrance fee of S/. 10. A little leaflet provided some information; the main draw is definitely the altar, the largest in Peru, 21m high and covered in gilding. There are also decent",
          "One of the many Churches in Cuzco, nevertheless very impressive to see all the art and wood work present in this church. Must See while in Cuzco!!!",
          "This church is a very interesting place to be at the heart of the city centre of Cuzco. The altars are very impressive and the view from the clock tower is great.",
          "This is a MUST see attraction. Again we the help of a guide one can truly appreciate the significance of this beautiful church. Amongst the numerous beautiful art is the most interesting ''last supper'' painting were the disciples eat Cuy (BBQ guinea pig) and drink Peruvian beer",
          "Resplendent with the gold and other riches of Spanish plunder. Beautiful, unusual religious imagery.",
          "It is a very pretty church and has a beautiful view from its windows to the Plaza de Armas, when we visited it was empty, I did not find it very touristic, but it is a nice place to visit.",
          "I was surprised to be charged 10 sol to visit this church ....... afterall it's a church. The alter is very decorative. ....... but no photos allowed. You can go upstairs to see the view of the main plaza. Overall nice but not worth the entrance fee.",
          "Impressive but completely ruined by the extortionate entry price. YES, you read that correctly... Not a tour price, BUT AN ENTRY FEE, to a working, practicing church! :( UNFORGIVABLE!",
          "It is not as magnificent as I expected after reading that the Jesuits tried to make that the main / best church in Cusco. The advantage of this church is that you can go up the stairs and have a nice viewpoint of the square from the window. 10 soles per adult.",
          "We took our time looking around the church like the others where they do not allow photos. It was an interesting walk up the stairs to see the view of the plaza.",

          "You can view the top of this fabulous and iconic monument almost throughout the city. It is another stunning piece of architecture from colonial times, smack dab in the center of the city. To me, this is as indicative of the country as the ever-present photo of Machu Picchu.",
          "I visited here with my wife. The facade was beautiful. We stepped into the inside, however, since a Sunday worship was taking place, we could not go to altar. There was a small square on the right side of the church, and the interesting event with the statues of characters of",
          "I don't know why I am choosing this church any more than any of its neighbouring churches and cathedral. The truth is that the buildings which form Cusco's Plaza de Armas are all completely stunning in every way...the architecture, the paintings and all the collections of gold",
          "If you hire a guide, which is crazy affordable and easy, then you'll get even more info. Ours took us to a small chapel behind the altar where echos do fun things, and then allowed us to climb up the balcony to look out onto the Plaza de Armas. It was great!",
          "Don't miss it after seeing the cathedral. The Jesuits did a great job not playing second fiddle. Great paintings, great wood work!",
          "There are just so many churches filled with gold and silver that I can stand...again, the native craftsmen who painted, built, gilded and otherwise decorated these churches were truly unknown yet wonderful artists.",
          "The church was big and festive inside. Spent about 20 minutes there. Good for a first-time visit. Not sure if I'd go back as a tourist after I've seen it once. But may be more interesting for regular church-goers.",
          "We loved walking around Plaza de Armas especially because of the cathedral and the church. They are both such a huge part of the city center and both really beautiful to look at. This church is very beautiful and well worth stopping by!",
          "Amazing looking place from the outside but not so amazing inside particularly if you've been to the Catherdral first. There are a few interesting pieces of art and you can climb up to the 2nd floor to get a better view and also a view of the Plaza outside. TAKE CARE - the",
          "It's an interesting church, and the view from the 2nd floor balcony of the Plaza de Armas is very nice. The church itself is a lot of gold and ornate cedar, with lots of paintings. It's all a bit over the top for me, but it's still something to see. I think it's worth the money.",
          "Worth 10 soles? We were not given a CD and there seemed to be a suggestion that an extra 5 soles were wanted to climb the tower which we did not do as stairs very steep! Wonderful paintings. the cathedral sells an excellent book on the Jesuits in Cusco 60 soles with good colour",
          "Incredibly ornate, holds a lot of history and details- but wear good shoes! This is a lot of walking, and the streets outside are cobblestone, so anything with thin soles will pain you",
          "Definitely worth taking in the Church for the art and architecture but not an essential stop. I would recommend it while you are acclimatizing to the altitude.",
          "This place was awesome! Lots of paintings and murals to look at. The day we visited was kind of rainy so it was a little dark but we took our time and saw it all. There is lots to do around the square as well. Dining, shopping, etc. and this is a great spot for photos",
          "Cusco, and these regions of Peru were known to have been laden with Gold. Maybe for this reason, the church here is laden with said precious metal on most of the interior facades. The structure is quite remarkable from the outside with minimal renovations. A bit smaller than",
          "Yes, the Jesuits may not have the star attraction, but in any other city they would. The location is on the Plaza, the ticket includes a CD, and the staff go out of their way to make sure you see all there is to see. As with the Cathedral, the sculptures are exceptional and",

          "This beautiful church is located right on Plaza de Armas. In addition to admiring the sculptures, paintings and other art, there is the opportunity to climb up towards the bell towers for an amazing view of the Plaza de Armas. Steps/stairs are steep and tight, but the view is",
          "I thought he building is amazing from the outside but was very underwhelmed with the inside. They charge a fee that I thought was inappropriate given the level of disrepair of some of the art work inside.",
          "This is only one of many churches in Cusco but it is an INCREDIBLE church. If you have limited time make sure this is one of the historic buildings that you go to visit. Originally when this church was built, it was filled literally with gold. Make sure you have an hour or two",
          "Grandiose religiosity and Baroque style at the highest level. Wood art, paintings and saints aplenty. Still, if you need to should go to the Cathedral.",

          "The church itself is lovely and we would have enjoyed walking around it. But a guide approached us as we entered and offered a tour in English or Spanish for 20 soles. It was definitely worth it! She explained so much about the history of the church and all the artwork in it.",
          "We heard Mass in this Jesuit Church. The Altar is unique the way the Holy Trinity was depicted. Jesus Christ seated at the right hand of the Father and the Holy Spirit looks like a ghostly figure between them. Never seen it like that before. There is both Gothic and Baroque in",
          "We went in after a walk-by, without a tour guide and no signs/pamphlets on its history, so just quietly enjoyed the towering amount of art which had a lot of detail. No photos allowed but the ticket price included a cd of photos. There is also a small stair case leading to the",

          "This was the only church I had the chance to visit. Worth paying 5 soles. From the 2nd floor you get very nice views of the square outside and the landscape. The altarpiece is really beautiful in gold leaf.",
          "If you visited the main cathedral, this church is not much different. The one feature worth the admission is the ability to climb to the 2nd floor and take photos of the plaza from there. The perspective is well worth it.",
          "This is an interesting church to visit. An example of colonial baroque architecture, the church has a huge cedar altar covered in gold leaf, and a number of side altars depicting various saints. No photography is allowed in the church. However, there is a narrow staircase at the",
          "This is another majestic church. Clearly colonial but it sets where Pachacutec's palace used to be. Inka walls can still be seeing surrounding the church. Beautiful decor gilded with pure gold (pan de oro) and silver.",

          "This is a must see with the help of a guide. I hired a women and learned more about the history and culture of the Inca people then I thought possible. Do not scrimp on the guide. This church is beautiful and full of Inca culture. For instance the Jesus Christ that the Incas",
          "The Cathedral may be the primary sightseeing objective around the central plaza of Cusco - mainly because of the guineapig being served at the last supper in a famous painting - I found the adjacent jesuit church from around 1600 to hold much more interesting secrets. Apart from",
          "Lovely church,impressive altar and good views of plaza but overpriced at 10soles as there is no explanation leaflet and you are not allowed to take photos, which is odd as you can at every other church I have visited!",
          "The church is very nice on the outside and in the inside. The ticket allowed you to get inside the church, in the two towers (with a nice view to the plaza de armas) it also has a underground part with a very nice thing with the sounds... As soon as you get in some guides offers",
          "The interior is nowhere as impressive as the cathedral. However it does contain probably the most impressive, biggest, and simply spectacular gold covered alter in all the Cusco churches. The S/10 entrance fee per person also gains you access to the two towers for great views",

          "I went to mass here on a Sunday morning and so not an official tour. The church is very grandiose and has a lot of things similar in other Baroque colonial style places. The high altar, made with gold plundered from the Inca empire, shines underneath the lights and is quite a",

          "Nice church but its hard to figure out all the colonial art without the help of a tour guide service. The church should include that within the church entrance fee",
          "Cusco Plaza is amongst the most impressive you will ever encounter. La Compania de Jesus in Cusco is one of the feature buildings, and is sometimes overlooked if you're time-poor, for the even more impressive Cathedral. I'd encourage you to make the time and see this gem. It's",
          "The Jesuits were responsible for building some incredible churches in South America. Cusco is one. So beautiful the Cathedral made them tone it down so it was not more attractive. Don't miss going up in the tower for a look over the grand plaza."

        "wiki": "Rodney Collin (26 April 1909 \u2013 3 May 1956) was a British writer in the area of spiritual development. His work was heavily influenced by his teacher P. D. Ouspensky and, through him, G. I. Gurdjieff and their system of spiritual development. Collin was one of the most well known of Ouspenky's students and a prolific writer. He met Ouspensky in 1936. \"Rodney Collin immediately recognised that he had found what he had been searching for in his reading and travels. From then on he dedicated all his time to the study of Mr Ouspensky's teaching.\" Collin's best known work, The Theory of Celestial Influence, is an ambitious attempt to unite astronomy, physics, chemistry, human physiology and world history with his own version of planetary influences.\nWithin Collin's most relevant contributions, it is the emphasis on the idea of Fourth Way school existing in different times. He says: \n\nSchools of the fourth way have existed and exist, just as schools of the three traditional ways existed and exist. But they are much more difficult to detect, because - unlike the others - they cannot be recognized by any one practice, one method, one task, or one name. They are always inventing new methods, new practices, suitable to the time and conditions in which they exist, and when they have achieved one task which was set them they pass on to another, often changing their name and whole appearance in the process.Collin studied the sequence of European civilizations, finding a pattern which would follow a planetary scale where the times are 10 times longer than in the case of human life. His sequence starts following Toynbee's but soon he changes some aspects, trying to follow his said pattern. Thus, his list begins with the Greeks (with roots on the Egyptian, which he considers the last one in the previous sequence), then the Romans, the Primitive Christians, the Monastic Christians, the Medieval Christians, the Renaissance and the Synthetic. He also quotes the influence of an extra-European civilization, the Arabic, upon the Medieval Christian civilization.Collin established a relation between Fourth Way schools and the origin and development of these civilizations.  He says:\n\nThus schools of the fourth way were undoubtedly behind the designing and construction of the great Gothic cathedrals, though they had no special name and adapted themselves to the religious organization of the time. For a time the Cluniacs sheltered them, for a time the Freemasons. In the seventeenth century, similar schools were responsible for much of the new scientific and medical research, sometimes under one name and sometimes under another. In the eighteenth century again, fourth way schools borrowed many of the discoveries of Greek and Egyptian archeology to clothe their ideas and their organization, while some of their leaders - in order to penetrate the luxury-loving and sophisticated circles where they had work to do - might even appear in the guise of fashionable magicians or mesmerists.The conceptual foundations for this project are the Law of Three, arguably similar to the triad of Thesis, antithesis, synthesis of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and the Law of Seven, the idea that the notes of the Western musical scale encode universal stages in essentially all developmental processes. Collin unites both of these schemata geometrically using the enneagram figure.\nCollin's other work includes The Theory of Eternal Life, which uses some of the ideas of The Theory of Celestial Influence as a point of departure to formulate a theory of the cycles and potentials of souls, e.g. reincarnation.  His works The Theory of Conscious Harmony and The Mirror of Light are more spiritual explorations of humanity: faith, acceptance and forgiveness in contrast to the philosophical scope of his earlier works.\nIn 1948, he, his wife Janet and several students of Ouspensky, who decided to follow him moved to the Tlalpan suburb of Mexico City. There they lived for two years. His book The Theory of Eternal Life was published anonymously in 1949, the same year he wrote the play Hellas (Hellas), which represents the various stages of Greek civilization. All this time Colleen did not stop working on the book \"Theory of Celestial Influence\", which was published only in 1953 in Spanish, and in 1954 - in English.\nIn 1949, Rodney and Janet Collin purchased a plot of land in the mountains outside the city of Mexico City, where in 1951 the foundation was laid for the planetarium \"Tetecala \", which in Aztec means \"Stone House of God.\" This building occupied a central place in the work of Rodney and people close to him throughout the following years. There were theatrical performances of esoteric mysteries, as well as meetings of Rodney Collin's groups.\nIn the spring of 1954, a group of Rodney Collin, under the name of \"The Unicorn Actors \", gave twelve public performances of Henrik Ibsen's \" Per Gunnet \" (Peer Gynt) for the residents of the town of Tlalpan. Rodney played the role of Button Caster. In 1954 and 1955 Rodney traveled to Europe and the Middle East, the main purpose of which was to collect material and establish links with the esoteric schools of the past. During his visit to Rome in 1954 he was accepted into the Roman Catholic Church. This step Rodney Collin pondered for a long time. With the help of Catholicism, he wanted to attract more people interested in the esoteric side of Christianity into his work. The choice in favor of Catholicism was not accidental, since it was the most popular religion in the countries of South America.\nAs a result of the distribution of books by Ediciones Sol in Latin America, Rodney Collin's groups started to appeared in Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, and contacts were established in several other countries of the American continent. In January 1955, Rodney visited groups in Lima and Buenos Aires, and then went to Cusco and Machu Picchu to study the remains of ancient civilizations.\nIn January 1956, Rodney Collin led an all-night foot procession 48 kilometers long to the place of worship of Our Lady of Guadalupe. During Mass in the Basilica, he fainted from exhaustion, although it later became clear that this was the first of several heart attacks from which he died in Peru on May 3, 1956. He fell off the bell tower of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco while having a heart attack.A memorial plaque for Rodney Collin is now placed by the bell tower at the Plaza de Armas.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nPalms and Patios\nThe Theory of Eternal Life\nHellas\nThe Theory of Celestial Influence\nThe Christian Mystery\nThe Herald of Harmony\nThe Mysteries of the Seeds\nThe Pyramid of Fire\nThe Whirling Ecstacy\nA Programme of Study\nThe Theory of Conscious Harmony (published posthumously)\nMirror of Light (published posthumously)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "What a great way to learn about the stars as well as the Inks culture ! Can\u2019t wait to go back fir another program!",
          "100% recommend visiting the planetarium! It is small, but the guides do a lot with what they have, and the fact that it is a family-run business is another strong reason to visit. The guides were super knowledgeable, friendly, and made learning about Inca astronomy really",
          "You'll be supporting a wonderful, family owned small operation in Cusco. They are a wonderful group, highly knowledgeable, with an extremely thorough presentation. I went with my 5 yr old, but it was a little too late in the evening for her and the content delivered at more of",
          "One of the most exciting experience for our tour in Peru was visit in Planetarium of Cusco, it is perfect attraction children and grownups and for everyone who is interested in astronomy. Definitely recommend for travelers who loves to watch in the sky and wonder for the stars.",
          "Humble setup (privately funded), but brilliant execution with very enthousiast guide. Obviously totally mad about stargazing and able to even get the kids involved and enthousiastic!",
          "Great value for money, the staff are very enthusiastic and clearly passionate about astrology. You learn so much and we had the chance to see Saturn and Jupiter through the telescopes they have. Definitely worth a visit!!!",
          "Family run planetarium, very passionate people who explain everything very nicely. Great knowledge sharing. Awesome to learn about how the Incas viewed the starry night and interpret it. Thank you!",
          "This place is great! You get to learn how the Incans used astronomy and you get to see stars and planets and maybe the moon! The staff members are very knowledgeable and passionate about astronomy. The planetarium offers this in both English and Spanish. They also gave us",
          "The Cusco Planetarium was great! We met the staff in town and took a shuttle bus to the planetarium. The staff gave two interactive presentations. Then we had the opportunity to look through telescopes at the nighttime sky - including planets and the moon! Plus they gave us",
          "Was included in our GAventure tour,so didn\u2019t know what to expect.it was so well done with tons of enthusiasm..The t\u00e9lescopes set up outside allowed us to see Jupiter as well as many more beautiful stars. Definitely go!",
          "The tour is very well organized and we learned a lot about the incas using the star constellations. The enthusiasm of the owner transfers to the visitors, which makes the visit once more to an unique trip! If you have an evening off, visit the planetarium and the dog Gandalf :)",
          "Amazing experience with very knowledgeable staff. The Passion that they showed was contagious not to mention it is family run! I can't recommend it enough!",
          "The time of departure when you buy from trip advisor is 6 pm on the email, apparently everyone else is told 5:40. We arrived what we thought was early at 5:50, and they had already left. We waiting for about 15 min tried calling and no one answered. Finally after 30 min someone",
          "We spent a lovely evening (chilly!) hearing about the constellations and then going outside (with blankets and hot mint tea provided) to view them on 3 large telescopes. Very interesting!",
          "This is a small, privately owned planetarium. I had my hotel make the reservation for me me a couple of days earlier and got in just fine. We were picked up by van at the square with the fountain right next to Plaza de Armas around 530PM, were given hot tea and were given a nice",
          "The meet up time for this event was 5:40 and we rushed to get there but missed the time by 10 minutes. Arriving at 5:50, there were 7 of us in our group so we immediately called the number on the receipt (it was disconnected), we emailed the email on the receipt (to no",
          "The activity was interesting, with introduction to astrology, live observation and then explanation of how inka\u2019s viewed the world. However the price is quite high (about 25$ pp) and the crowed quite big (about 40), which did not allow for quality observation and everything",
          "We went there for an evening trip of stargazing and exploration. The staff was extremely nice and informative and truly shared the Incan spirit!",
          "Tour was tonight, got to the pick up point at correct time, had to wait for a further 30 minutes as organizers appeared to be still admitting guests. This resulted in not enough transport buses for guests so we had to wait for another vehicle, delaying trip even further. Pathway",
          "We don\u2019t know how this tour got such good reviews. Think they are more interested in getting the money that they had over 30 people at once. They split us into 2 groups and then we had to wait in the freezing cold as they only had 2 telescopes. While waiting we were given a talk",
          "A must if you are going into the wilds of Peru on the Inca trek for educating you in the stars you will see and the Incas. If you get a clear night on the trail the night sky will be awe inspiring but meaningless without the background you will get from your visit but do book.",
          "We booked a long time in advance as it was our only free evening in Cusco. The day was a bit cloudy but we were very lucky that the skies got clear by the time of our visit. They pick you up near the main square and take you to a charming small building. This is a family-run",
          "Not really what we were expecting, we arrived to this little house on the hill. But once in, it was worth it! The guides are well informed and make the visit interesting and fun. We learnt a lot. We were lucky to get a clear sky so we could see the stars on their telescopes! A",
          "I practice a bit of astronomy, but even the lay person would appreciate the stargazing and listening to the way Incas guided using the skies. So they pick you up in some vans and then take you to the family owned astronomy site. Much will hinge on sky conditions but they have 2",
          "They set up a meeting point near the town square which is the same place they drop you off at. The planetarium they take you to is a small two room house so if your expecting this big nice place then don\u2019t. They crew is very nice and passionate about their work. The information",
          "We were fortunate enough to pick a clear night to see the southern stars inside and out. Very well run and fun to actually see the constellations through two real telescopes. Well worth the time!",
          "We were met in Central Cusco and driven up to the planetarium - great views over the city on the way up! Started with an interesting presentation about what can be seen in the night sky in the south and also about how the Inca's interpreted the stars. The planetarium part was",
          "It was a beautiful experience, great service the people who run it love what they do which adds to the whole experience, I highly recommend it if you are in Cuzco take the time to visit the planetarium",
          "This was a fun way to spend our last night in Cusco. Was it the most professional planetarium in the world? No. But it was a great evening spent with the guides who are obviously very passionate about the stars. It is a small family run business and that's what I loved about it.",
          "This is an interesting evening and presented by knowledgeable and enthusiastic people. For that reason I give it 4 stars. I knew little about astronomy and learnt a lot - the planetarium projections were quite interesting but the telescopes outside are very weather",
          "Although we went on a rainy night and couldn't see the stars we were treated to a knowledgeable talk about the history of astronomy in the region and a very clever and high tech projector system that demonstrated numerous constellations and gave a much greater understanding of",
          "I enjoy astronomy. I would only recommend this visit if you are into this. It's mostly educational. Also, go during the dry season when it isn't cloudy. If it's cloudy there won't be much to see in the skies.",
          "I did this on my first night in Cusco for something short and informative. Astronomy has always been a favorite subject of mine and this was a lot of fun. The family that runs this little planetarium really loves to share their knowledge and excitement about astronomy. You'll",
          "Do not expect super professional astrophysics here, but this group gave us an enjoyable tour and introduction to how the Peruvian people interpret the stars and space. We enjoyed getting to see the Southern cross, and they set up telescopes so we could see various",
          "This \u2018tour\u2019 is way to overprized in my opinion. You will be told about how the Inka farmers used the stars for their agriculture, which is pretty nice to know. Then will be taken to a \u2018dome\u2019 to get some more information about formations of the stars. Last part is to view some",
          "First time stargazing and it was a very different experience. The staff at Planetarium was very knowledgeable and gave an interesting introduction on the Western and Inca astrology history. I thought it was way too cold when we were outside stargazing even though we were",
          "My family and I visited Cusco over Thanksgiving Break. I chose the Planetarium based on the great reviews from Trip Advisor, but I am not sure how they got excellent reviews. I think this place is very overpriced. The day we visited was cloudy so we could not see any planets.",
          "some interesting facts but presented more for children than adults and a bit amateur. The dome is small, which wouldn\u2019t matter but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smooth, which does matter. The projection is incredibly blurred and the stars lack any detail so u don\u2019t really get to see the",
          "Booked this through Viator. What a pleasant experience. We were able to see Saturn's rings and one moon through the telescope. Maria was very knowledgeable about the Incan history of the stars and planets and Jose gave us an education of the stars in the Southern",
          "What a great family business! Maria explained a whole heap about the importance of astronomy to the Incas, then Jose (a master with their digital star projector) took us on a guided tour of the heavens, both modern & Incan. Amazing experience! Would make this a \u2018must do\u2019",
          "This was a great trip for the early evening. It is a family run business and it\u2019s clear to as the hard work that put into the planetarium. The talks where really interesting and engaging about both stars in general and the Incas. Unfortunately it had been a day of thunderstorms",
          "This was a great excursion, we were with \u201cG adventures\u201d, so it was included in our stay in Cusco. We got to use high powered telescopes and look at the planets. Got to see Saturn\u2019s rings, which was so cool. Learnt about the Inka legends of the stars. It was quite cold, but",
          "I was in the Planetarium with an friend and we we\u00b4re so exited, to learn something about the southern sky. It was really familiar, super funny and we learnd a lot. Our tour was in english. I, as a not native speaker, got all important information. First we learnd some about the",
          "I wasn\u2019t even thinking of booking this until a friend of mine mentioned it. Am I glad I did. We were picked up in Cusco and taken by bus just out of town to this little out of the way spot with this small building. Very unassuming. When we got there we were kind of split into 3",
          "We really enjoyed the pre- telescope lecture, the indoor planetarium with both modern and Inca astronomy, and using the telescopes to view Saturn, Cygnus, and more! Glad we brought our jackets and recently purchased Peruvian knit hats and gloves. It is still a bit chilly at",
          "I loved that the planetarium is family-owned and operated, and the owners clearly care that their guests have a good experience. Unfortunately we have a cloudy night, but we did get to see Mars and Saturn as well as a few cool stars and constellations. Just seeing Saturn was",
          "I went here last night. You book through the website to reserve a place then pay at the planetarium after learning about and seeing the stars and planets. The people who work there are so passionate and knowledgeable in their field, I wasn't expecting to learn so much but was",
          "This privately owned planetarium is really sweet and well set up. We enjoyed learning about some history of how peruvians have viewed the starts and then seeing the historical and modern sky in their projection room. The staff are all very passionate about astronomy which was",
          "Very interesting couple of hours learning about the Southern Hemisphere constellations and how important it was to the early Peruvians. Small scale set up, with very knowledgable staff.",
          "Very informative and fun. We learned about the Southern constellations and especially about the Inca dark constellations.",
          "I cannot believe I payed 75 soles voor this. I was so dissapointed! I mean the people are very enthousiastic and friendly but they really race trough their story and if you dont know a lot about stars you can hardly follow it. Only the Inca part was interesting, but also really",
          "Family run planetarium was an excellent visit. Very knowledgeable and interesting. They gave us great background and history and provided an opportunity to look at different stars and planets through the telescopes. Great!!!",
          "very interesting informations on our sky, the milky way, how to find and recognize stars, looking throug huge telescopes and see the moon, venus, mars. Super!",
          "Don't get me wrong, Machu Picchu was cool buttt this was even better! The pick you up in the center of the city and take you just about 15 minutes or so outside of the city. They teach you about the constellations and then you get to see them for yourselves. I had never been",
          "We went to the planetarium yesterday evening and enjoyed the experience. We have been to other planetariums (London, Tokyo) and have to say this one has its own special charm to it. The indoor dome was great, the outdoor one magnificent! Any explanations we received were clear.",
          "Overall a good tour. Adorable family planetarium and a unique experience overall. But it's a lit of info and I found it a little long (and I'm a little into this stuff). Not something I'd recommend to everyone. It was a cloudy night when I went so couldn't use the telescope to",
          "This attractions is out of the tourist circuits in Cusco. We found it in a little comment on lonely planet and was a great discovery, well organiseed, content was interesting and the speakers have done a great job. Last part of using telescopes to see planets was a good end of",
          "The passion put into this family-run planetarium is truly impressive. This is a fantastic opportunity to see storms on Jupiter, rings around Saturn, Southern hemisphere constellations and learn from local astronomers.",
          "The astronomer was incredibly knowledgeable and interesting. He taught us all about Peruvian constellations in addition to pointing out the Southern Cross and astrological signs. The telescopes they use are impressive. This experience is for everyone, even those who aren't",
          "We went to the Planetarium the first night we arrived in Cusco. Our entire group of 11 really liked this event. There are three parts to the evening and it ran great. They have a dome, where you are guided through the Southern night sky, Incan constellations, how to spot",
          "Our group of 14 was picked up around the main square and taken to the planetarium where we had an interesting lesson on general Incan history and religion as well as information about the colonization of Peru. This info was very interesting and it improved our stargazing",
          "It was great to learn about Incan astrology while in Cusco. They did a great job of explaining the various constellations and set up telescopes outside that we could see some of the stars from, as well as Jupiter. We visited just before doing the Inca Trail, so got to see the",
          "All of the guides were very nice and in English. They gave us blankets for the cold and we learned about the Inca constellations and explored their indoor planetarium also.",
          "Presentation of information was fine but more powerful telescopes would increase what could be seen and detail of what was viewed which would improve the experience.",
          "Nice way to spend an evening getting to understand the southern sky and the Inka constellations. They pick you up in a central location in town, take you for an indoor and outdoor start experience and then bring you back. Very hands on, great for kids!",
          "Went on June 29, 2018 on our last day in Cusco, was fantastic! Family run business. Transportation provided to outside of Cusco town center. Great explanations both when we were looking through the telescopes outside and also inside. Learned so much, definitely worth the",
          "We visited the planetarium in July 2017 and it was definitely a trip highlight. We enjoyed learning about the night sky and the Inca constellations, study of astronomy and impact on architecture. Previewing the stars in the planetarium and then moving to the night sky was a",
          "We visited the Planetarium on one of our first nights in Cusco- it was incredible!! Not only were each of the staff very knowledgeable, professional, and kind, but it was an incredibly well organized experience. We were not sure what to expect, especially when driving in, but it",
          "Family run planetarium, objective information given. I felt it was worth the entry fee. They do an inside presentation and then take you outside to view the sky. They had 3 large telescopes to look thru and gave commentary on each sky view. Very nice job!!",
          "Staff picked group at plaza and drove us to the planetarium. Don\u2019t expect a typical modern dome like typical venues, this is a rather rustic house. Staff was very kind and careful with explanations of classic constellations. The top part of the visit is getting to know old inka",
          "This is a quaint, family owned planetarium up near SasksayHuaman. They'll pick you up from the plaza right next to the Plaza de Armas, and drop you off at the end of the night. They have a very well produced show, featuring a short lecture on the Inca and pre Inca fascination",
          "The planetarium offered a free shuttle to and from the site. We learned so much about the Southern Sky and Incas. It was so amazing!!",
          "This is a family run business. The family is very knowledgeable and has the whole experience set up in a very organized way. After being picked up from the square in town, the van takes you to their home just past Sacsayhuaman. After an astronomy lecture, there is view of the",
          "This is a very well run trip by knowledgeable, friendly hosts. It made a nice change from all the walking and Inca ruins. The stars are still the same as those seen by long ago civilizations. My teenagers enjoyed it more than my 7 year old who was just too tired after a busy day",
          "Our tour organizer added a trip to the Planetarium to our first night in Cusco. We were a little skeptical when we arrived to a rather small building in the suburbs above the city- not a dome as we expected but something that looks like a farm house. BUT this is a very",

          "The Planetarium was included in our tour and was pretty cool. It was pretty cold so dress warmly. They had a formal presentation in the dome showing what the sky looked like right now and comparing to Incan times. Afterwards we went outside to look through three telescopes. It",
          "We visited the Planetarium as part of our Cusco at Night tour with Valentin Pachamama Journeys, a fantastic company! Alog with our guide Valentine we meet up with the Planetarium Owners and others heading to the planetarium and took a bus to the planetarium. We were directed",
          "Was there Monday night - presentations were extremely well done, the indoor sky show is best we\u2019ve ever seen - and as a bonus the sky was pretty clear, so we saw moon up close, Southern Cross and Jupiter moons through lenses. Helps when they provide the blankets because it was",
          "This small and intimate operation is family run. We met the guides at a plaza and were taken in vans to the planetarium (also dropped off to center in vans). In the first part of the presentation you learn how to locate various constellations both modern and those perceived by",

          "This tour includes an oral overview, a look at the night skies and a visit to the planetarium to see the ancient Inka skies. The universe was a major influence on the Inka culture so this tour helps you build some background/context for other learnings about the Inka culture.",
          "This was one of the \"if I have time, I'll do it tours\" and it was fantastic! They were easy to find in the plaza and it was a short walk to the vans to take you to the planetarium. Once there, we received a little history lesson about the incas and their astronomy before heading",
          "The Planetarium is family-owned and by far one of the coolest things I've done while here in Cusco. Since I grew up in the States, I was amazed to learn about the constellations in the Southern Hemisphere. They have the observatory inside, but once you've finished in there, they",

          "The family business is authentic and knowledgable. Actually, Jos\u00e9 might have been the best guide/presenter I have seen in South America! Get ready to learn a lot, question a lot and become even more excited about the universe! 100% worth it. Thank you :D",
          "Booked & paid for my tour online in advance. The guide met us at the arranged place on time and we had a short walk (only as roads were closed due to celebrations) before getting in a minibus for a short drive up the hill. We had a full van so I\u2019d advise booking well in advance.",
          "I visited as part of a tour group. This was a beautiful setting above the town. The staff was very pleasant, but because it is small and family owned, don\u2019t expect amenities such as shopping, etc. My group received a lesson on constellations and telescopes were set up outside so",

          "This is a family owned affair and the whole family clearly has the astronomy bug! For 50 Soles per person, you are picked up by minibus at the Plaza Regocijo and taken to their planetarium on the edge of town. I would recommend going even if it is overcast as they provide an",

          "This was absolutely one of my favorite things we did in Cusco. It was an amazing and knowledgable experience. There were large telescopes and beautiful, friendly dogs. We were very lucky and got a very clear night, but this may not always be the case. Even if it is a cloudy",
          "We had such a great time at the planetarium. The first guide who gave the historical background of the planetarium and the historical information really brought the story-telling to life, he was fantastic. They also gave us blankets which was much appreciated! Then we went",

          "Excellent way to spend a few hours during the evening in Cusco. Great value at 50 soles per person. After an interesting talk on the constellations in the dome, we were led outside to view the stars. Depending on the clouds you should get a great view e.g. the scorpius",

          "We did a group tour in English on a Saturday night and loved it! The staff are absolute fans of the universe and Peru and after visiting one cannot help it but be one too. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Really enjoyed this local activity as a family. The two hour group tour meets up in one of the plazas and goes by bus to the site. The experience includes an overview of the Incas beliefs, experiencing the southern sky in the planetarium and finally going to use the telescopes",
          "This is a 2 hour activity after a quick 15 minute bus ride up the hills of Cusco. The planetarium has a nice little setup and the lecture that was given to us inside was visually interesting and informative. We were then able to look at some star clusters and planets through 3",

          "We had an evening free in Cusco and made arrangements for this visit. This is a family business. We were met on time at the exact location and escorted to the planetarium. The young man who gave the lecture was very well informed and told us facts that we found useful later",
          "My two friends and I visited the planetarium during our stay in Cusco. It was such a great evening! You're picked up from a square and taken about 10-15 min outside of the city to a family run farm-esque feeling place. The family that owns the planetarium is clearly passionate",
          "This was a well run family operation that offered lots of great information. We did this our first night in Cusco and it was a great way to be out without being overly active while acclimatizing to the altitude. Very interesting to learn about how the Inca used the stars.",
          "Run by a Family who explain everything so interesting A must if you have time and visiting Cuzco you can even look through the telescopes ans see Saturn",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to South America. Enthusiastic team gave very engaging presentation following which we were able to look through telescopes at the night sky. We even got to see saturn's rings! Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The visit was great, I would say a bit short and quick. At the end of the session we were supposed to use the telescope, but the guy who does it was not there, and our guide was not experienced with it, although he has good knowledge of what he spoke about",
          "This little gem is kept very quiet in Cusco but I'm delighted a friend suggested we go! Family run planetarium, uncle picks you up from plaza regocijo at 5.40pm and brings you up to the planetarium where his niece and nephew talk you through the importance of astronomy to the",
          "They are really passionate about astronomy and provide lots of information about Inca beliefs in relation to the stars as well as modern theories. Unfortunately it was really cloudy the night that we went which meant once we got outside we couldn't see much at all. However, the",
          "Learn about the stars with a very nice host in this family run business. For the sake of 50 Soles per person it's well worth the money",
          "My travel partner and I really like astronomy, and had never learned about the Southern skies. We called the planetarium from our hotel, and they left a message for us telling us they were open. They picked us up in a tourist van at a nearby square, a guy in a Planetarium Cusco",
          "Have you tried Maltesers before? Come here to enjoy it with your eyes. If you join the sunset and moon rise tour, you are able to view not only the sunset scenery with Milky Way and sunset ray but the moon rises. The brightness of the moon is irresistance to taste like the",
          "We decided it would be worth learning about the constellations so we could understand a little better what we'd be seeing at night on our Machu Picchu trek, and wow, this Planetarium is worth the visit! Ana Maria's enthusiasm is contagious. She was a wonderful teacher, as was",
          "Our family really enjoyed this family run business. My children ranging from infant to 13 years old enjoyed the tour as well. It was interesting to hear about the history of the Incas incorporated in the presentation. The best part was being able to see Saturn and its ring",
          "We loved every moment of it. They were so great. They had blankets and music (although the live music may not happen every night, but I wish it did!). They joked with our toddler and incorporated him into the presentation hen he was getting fidgety. You can tell it's a family",
          "A family run business that inspires you! It also gives you the history on why the stars, moon and sun were so important to the Inkas an how we now as a population have lost their importance. You view the stars inside in the dome built room and then then the images with a",
          "This is a small, family run operation and they are all very knowledgeable. We learned a lot about how the Incans used astrology for agriculture and many other things. We were also taught about the constellations of the southern hemisphere before going outside to observe them. It",
          "This was excellent. It is shame that there is so much light pollution where the planetarium is located, but don't let that deter you. It is a very neat family, doing what they love and just so passionate about it. Dress warm as the temperature drops at night, the presentation is",
          "As an hobby astronomer I found this fun and informative. Got pointed out southern hemisphere only constelations, viewed two double star systems and Saturn. The planetarium session with the Incas dark constellations was nice. It would have been nice if the location to be further",
          "This place is amazing, a must do while in Cusco. Inexpensive and the tour is awesome. Definitely recommend it",
          "I signed up for the planetarium tour and had the best time. We met up in a square located near plaza aramas. We then drove up to Saqsaywaman. I have to admit my expectation was to see a modern day planetarium, so when we drove up to their building I was at first taken aback.",
          "First, let me just say that I am NOT a planetarium person. My friends and I were looking for attractions near Cusco and decided to go. Turns out, this was one of my favorite experiences during my time in Peru! This planetarium is run by a family and they are SO enthusiastic and",

          "An amazing tour! They sit you down and give a talk on the history of the incas and how they used astrology in day to day life. Then you are shown all the star constellations in their dome room. When it's dark outside you have a chance to look at planets and stars through a",
          "The Planetarium Cusco was a surprise highlight of our trip. It\u2019s a private family operation run by people who are truly passionate about the night sky and Peruvian history/folklore. The uncle/niece guide team used interactive storytelling to teach us about outer space and how",

          "This is such a great hidden secret! Family owned planetarium with loads of pasion and humor. We were picked up just before dark from Regocijo square in the centre and brought to the planetarium just outside of the city. The tour had three stages, a story on the way the Incas",

          "First of all, BE ON TIME! They aren't kidding when they say they leave promptly. We nearly missed our ride, thanks to a bit of traffic. Despite still being a small facility, their enthusiasm shines through all they do. We had a great time being guided through the southern skies.",
          "It has been awhile since I visited this and I have never written a negative review, but this was very disappointing. What I thought were a few pictures in the waiting room was one of their main features. Also, there were 8 people attending the very cold night and we had to wait",

          "I have to say, this experience was pretty fun. I have always loved astronomy and star gazing, so this was a must for me. This family run planetarium was pretty impressive and very informative. My 7 year old really enjoyed it!!!",
          "The planetarium was a great value couple of hours and worth searching out. It is family run and they are very enthusiastic about astronomy and sharing this with the visitors. The pick up is not at the main plaza and is a little hard to find but they seem to work it out.",
          "We reserved a few spots with this site for a last-evening-in-Cusco experience. We were delighted by the family, the planetarium dome, Gandalf, Jose, and the star gazing with his uncle. Every effort is made to make guests comfortable. What we learned added to our knowledge",
          "loved the personal touch. We were in a large group but they made sure that we all had opportunities to use each telescope and ask any questions. It's a small planetarium but a lovely excursion.",
          "Great family business. Learnt a lot about the southern hemisphere and the inka history. Everybody was enthusiastic and really liked to teach us something. Even got a pickup from the city",

          "I have so many things to say about this planetarium, that I don't know where to start... Let me begin saying that I am a professional astronomer and I totally recommend the visit if you, too, can value the work of a man and a family that have no support at all from the",
          "Nice, funny presentation about the Inka's science, how they observed the stars and the seasons through structures. They predict what and when to plant, that made them so strong. After this, we have presentation of the southern star maps, and went out to see them in real. 50S",
          "We heard about the Planetarium on a whim and decided to try it out on a free night in Cusco. We were incredibly impressed with the experience and the amount that we learned about Incan history. Would recommend to anyone.",

          "This little planetarium is well put together and driven by the passion of an entire family. A self made dome, a presentation hall and a series of telescopes to see the sky for yourself. If you're into space, or this is your first time in the southern hemisphere, go here. NOTE:",
          "I went here because I wanted to learn more about constellations in the Southern Hemisphere. When the evening started I was worried that the planetarium was not going to impress me but it really did. This family-run business is small, but they have impressive telescopes and a",

          "We didn't have a chance to make a reservation, but they made room for us anyway. Funny and friendly staff picked us up and showed us the wonders of the southern hemisphere. They spoke excellent English and showed us a half dozen things in their telescope, explained many",
          "I arranged a tour with Planetarium Cusco three months in advance. They requested that we switch out date so we did, and agreed to meet at the regocijo square at 6:40 pm. We waited for thirty minutes and even had a nearby store call them for us but there was no answer. Very",
          "We had a fun time at the planetarium despite it being cloudy and not a very good night for stargazing. Very well organized transportation and presentation. We learned about modern astrology as well as the astrological beliefs of the Incas. Very interesting material and it was",
          "A great and fun way to spend the evening. It is also a great way to familiarise yourself with the stars and constellations in the Southern hemisphere, prior to a trip on the Inca Trail or other areas of low light pollution. The presentation gives you the opportunity to see the",
          "Good meeting and presentation given in three stages. I was unfortunate that it was a cloudy night but learnt a lot about El nino and the dark constellations. Quite a treat really, but a bit steeply priced. I would advise to do this before trek to get the most value from the",

          "One of the highlights of my trip to Peru - a real hidden gem. We learnt things about the Incas that countless other tours didn't tell us about. A wonderful, peaceful and charming night. Great family business doing something brilliant with passion and knowledge.",
          "takes you out of the city for an amazingly informative view of the night sky, you feel like you're in the country, and the guides were young, well informed, and seemed genuinely interested, which made it great for us too.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect, but this family run planetarium really knocked it out of the park and were even able to do it with their rustic setup. You don't need anything fancy to talk about the stars and the influence that it had on the culture in Peru. They go into a lot of",
          "Who knew this existed? Apparently a lot more people than I would have thought. This attraction is actually listed in the Lonely Planet book although the price has increased since then (50 soles). Well worth a visit if you are into space, even if you are not it is pretty cool!",
          "Thank you for such an informative and wonderful presentation. The stories alone were worth it, but to connect the inca with modern astronomy was sweet. The presentation was stellar and we just loved it. It was uber cool to see the southern stars which we normally don't get to",
          "The guys who ran it were very interesting and passionate, there was the right amount of information and looking at the night sky with the telescope was fascinating! A must do in Cusco if you have any interest in the stars and the Incan\u00b4s relationship with them.",

          "It felt like the sky was so close at the Cusco Planetarium making this well worth the price and something I definitely recommend while in Cusco. We met Ana Marie at the Plaza Regocijo and were taken by the planetarium's van to their site. Be sure to dress warm as you are outside",
          "Our tour to the Cusco Planetarium started with being picked up from one of the squares. After a short 10 minute ride we arrived and were greeted warmly. Our guide was very informative and passionate. You could feel her energy and enthusiasm during the presentation. Afterwards we",

          "My sister and I made a reservation with the planetarium. We waited at the meeting point for forty minutes after the meeting time (and we were there 20 minutes early) before returning to our hotel. When we returned to the hotel we phoned to determine why the planetarium",
          "This was one of the best things I have done in Peru! Intimate group, and the most enthusiastic guides! Learned so many interesting things, was fascinating to learn about how other cultures used and interpreted the stars. Great value. My only advice: wear LOTS of clothes, it was",
          "Picked up in town. This was one of the best experiences of my two weeks in Peru and I am not an astronomer. The enthusiasm of the owners was wonderful. I saw Jupiter through their telescope. It was cold. A starry night which made it good but cold. They provided blankets",

          "Ana Maria is delightful! We arranged to visit the Planetarium via email with her. It's not in Cusco, but about 10 minutes outside. Conveniently, they pick you up in one of the town squares for your evening visit. Out at their cosy farmhouse/observatory, Ana Maria explained the",

          "This was definitely one of the most interesting places i've been. The people are extremely enthusiastic about the stars, they are proud on the incaculture and will tell you all about it. I've learned more here than in any other museum in Cusco. It was also a really nice",
          "The astronomer who runs this family business clearly loves his work and his enthusiasm for astronomy is infectious. They opened up the small but totally adequate planetarium for our family, showed us the constellations and night sky over Cusco, gave us information about Incan",

          "This was one of the highlights of our time in Cuzco. We had a great time together as a family and overall both kids enjoyed themselves tremendously (ten-year old was fidgety during the initial part that was lecture-based). We each got a little blanket with stars on it to help",
          "My friend and I learned so much about Machu Picchu and andean culture during this cozy class. We liked the dome, blankets and tea too. My only suggestion is to light up the stairs with a flashlight. It's cheap, effective and prevents falls.",
          "We decided to visit the planetarium based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor although this place was not listed in Lonely Planet's SA on a shoestring. It turned out that this was not the wisest financial decision as the cost of 50 soles/ pax was a tad too expensive, given that",
          "My wife and I were in Cusco last April. Very last minute we decided to visit the planetarium. They were flexible with their hours and stayed open late for us. A driver met us and we drove up the beautiful hillside to a quaint planetarium where we were greeted by Ana Maria, our",
          "The Cusco Planetarium have friendly and enthusiastic staff but the program could be better. I think the cost (50 Soles) is a bit high for the 1 1/2 hour presentation but the pick up and drop off was nice. The program included quite a bit of time in their dome on constellations",
          "The Planetarium is definitely a place to visit during your stay in Cusco. It is run by Ana Maria and her family, including their cute dog, and they really do their best in order to give the visitors all their knowledge as well as their sincere passion. For this reason they did",

          "I really enjoyed my time learning about the Southern hemisphere's night sky. They will pick you up in the small plaza beside plaza de armas and take you to their facilities just up on the hillside. There are three aspects of this experience: 1) First thing you do is learn",
          "I'm going to begin by saying you HAVE to do this. The enthusiasm of the lady was incredible for starters, she has so much passion about the stars its highly addictive. Before you look through the telescope, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere constellations are explained. This",
          "The enthusiasm these people have about stars (and dark spaces between stars) is absolutely contagious. They put such an effort into showing you the splendors of the night and explain how important star gazing was for agriculture and the success of the Incas. Seeing the moon",
          "We went based on the prior reviews and were not disappointed. This is a lovely family-run business and a really nice way to spend an evening in Cusco. We enjoyed all aspects of the visit - from the informative intro, to the star gazing, to learning more about the",
          "The Planetarium is quite possibly the best attraction to be found within the city of Cusco itself. A short 20 minute ride up to the Reserva ecologica de Llaullipata brings you to a very different looking planetarium from those you may be used to. This however just adds to the",
          "This is a wonderful, family run, friendly, informative and fantastic value experience. You can see the moon and Saturn and more through the telescopes, learn about the stars, Incan history and how they used and interpreted the stars, hear stories and snuggle up under a starry",
          "The hosts were very welcoming and had great knowledge of the night sky. The talk was interesting and the planetarium show was great. Luckily we did get to do some stargazing before we were clouded out. The location was very convenient and getting picked up and dropped off in",
          "Wow, this really blew my mind. Who knew the Incas looked at the dark parts of the sky to find their constellations, rather than the stars? It was also so fun to look through the telescope at the night sky for real. This is a great, great attraction.",

          "Great views of the city. Wonderful example of Inca architecture. If you\u2019re in Cusco for more than a day, visit this place.",
          "You should go with a guide who can explain this awesome site otherwise you could miss some very interesting aspects of the place. Amazing how the stones were cut and placed despite their size. How did they do it?!",
          "This was an interesting ruin just outside the city of Cusco. It\u2019s an easy cab ride up, or there are several tour groups you can find in Cusco. It\u2019s impressive in size, and how they could move these stones blows my mind.",
          "Although Machu Picchu is more impressive from a general perspective, actually Sacsayhuaman has a more refined built to it, and it makes sense because this was the centre of the Incan world. It's very easy to get here if you are in Cusco, it's not that expensive and it's really",
          "Really great half day tour led by Carlos Amazing ruins and fascinating to learn about Inca history. This is a must see",
          "These Incan ruins are much more impressive than say \"Stonehenge\", because of the volume of granite stones used to build the magnificent structures used to study the planets and stars while worshipping the gods as they knew them.",
          "Saqsaywanman is an unfinished Inca holy site. Its pronunciation is close to Sexy Woman. I didn't do my homework in advance, when m wife told me the name, I really thought it was a Sexy Woman. At the entrance, a native Indian corrected my pronunciation, saying there was no",
          "You probably need half a day to fully explore this site. This was our first exposure to the Quechua culture and the mysteries surrounding their ancient empire. How did the build all of this with bronze tools and without work animals? But the sites are amazing. Make sure to",
          "Incas built this location for festivals & worship. Amazing what the Incas built without beasts of burden. Stones weigh anywhere from 10 to 25 tons. An architectural wonder. Not far from central square in Cusco. Worth the visit!",
          "Situated on a Plateau overlooking Cusco this site covers a large area and is worth a visit. The main point of interest is the remains of the old walls of the fortress. One can only wonder how much effort in human terms it took to transport the huge stones and assemble the",
          "We could not have a good explanation about the platforms of Sexywoman. The work of the incas was very difficult to understand.",
          "Pretty amazing to see. Nobody seems to know how ruins like this were built with such precision. Lots of tourist shops below with alpaca goods. Be careful though as some things you are offered are not truly alpaca or llama. Some have mixed materials but they are sometimes",
          "This site may not be \"sexy\", but it is definitely more impressive than Stonehenge. The Inca people created an amazing place of worship here..!!",
          "Get a guide. Trust me. Use Lamanita Travel. Everything is super awesome but it\u2019s more amazing with the info provided by a guide.",
          "It would be worth it if the entrance price was cheaper. The view from above is nice though. But the ruins itself is not so special and quite small.",
          "Amazing to see. Fascinating history. I hired a private guide and driver. Sacsayhuaman is about an hour away from Cusco.",
          "first I went to Ollantaytambo, then here. when you visit it that way, this isn't worth the S//70 - you cant really see something more special here and the employes were quite unfriendly.",
          "I found myself in Cuzco one cloudy afternoon, after long journey (nearly three days of being on road) via London, Madrid and Lima. First things first, so before I went to take a look at famous Inca fortress I'd sorted out accommodation and transport for the next day. The",
          "It is a great place for a peaceful and nice stroll close to Cusco. Take the bus to Cristo Blanco only for 1 sol.",
          "These ruins are amazing to see, the walk is nice and the views amazing. It is very well organised and makes the walking easy.",
          "This is an incredibly impressive site - a perfect day hike from Cusco to walk the extensive ruins and find out more about the Incas' desperate struggle against the invading Spaniards. Do not miss it.",
          "This place was a historic gold mine! A military fort made in the 1400s during Pachacuti s reign. The workmanship was amazing and mind boggling! But the guide I had made this experience so much better. Elvira Quispe was a walking book of interesting Information regarding",
          "Went as part of a Gate 1 tour group. Worth the price of admission for Incredible view of Cusco from the ruins. Also saw a group of Alpaca grazing on the opposite hill. Pretty quick tour. I would recommend it",
          "We walked up from the Plaza de Armas which gave the right kind of intro to the site. The views from the miradors were spectacular. The zig-zag fortifications were amazing. It is hard to believe that this could have been constructed by humans without heavy machinery.",
          "A great start to understanding the Inca Capitol. Massive stone work constructed like nothing you will understand. Commanding views over the valley and Cusco below. Green and lush in the summer. Peaceful and heavenly",
          "Wed did a tour of Cusco and went on to this temple - just outside the city. It is a temple that is not as preserved as Machu Picchu but is spectacular in its own right. The Sacsayhuaman fortress-temple complex lies at the northern edge of the former Inca capital Cusco. It was",
          "Impressive site on hills above Cusco, great stones tightly packed in tiers like a fortress. A popular stop on Sacred way route",
          "The incredible tour, we made the city tour with a local travel agency and we are grateful to have been part of them.",
          "There are so so many ruined and so so much history to learn I recommend Peru to anyone who is interested urn good food and something different from Europe. The people are friendly, and except for a rather cold airbnb. in Cusco (except for some hotels heating is not at all",
          "Walked from our hotel up to sacsayhuaman via the steps at the top of the town where we were harassed by local taxi men and told we could not pass and we needed to get a taxi to the top with them as the steps were closed to tourists?? So we decided to walk the long way around and",
          "We loved to spend a few hours in this ruins and enjoyed the time. It is walking distance from Cusco City center (around 20min and with the altitude it takes a little longer, but it was an experience). You can see the beautiful city from this ruins and walk to the Jesus christ",
          "We hired a tour guide at the ticket booth for Sacsayhuaman, which was a great choice. Jose added color to our exploration of this significant Incan site. The head of the Puma that is Cusco.",

          "This may be the best of the ruins to visit from Cusco. The area is huge, allow 3-4 hours to explore everything. Bring lots of food and drink as there isn' much at the site in the way of this. I would recommend getting a guide so that you can hear the background story on what",
          "Amazing place to visit! Beautiful and interesting. This is easy to walk and hike and the history and the stones in these buildings and walls just will blow you away. Not to be missed.",
          "The first places I visited when I came in Cusco. An impressive place. A guide ( 40 SOL) showed me during approximately two hours everything of Sacsaywaman. (Some name it sexywoman). He showed me the figures of a snake and Lama for example. When you are planning to visit the old",
          "Unless you take a guided tour, the walls don't have a lot of meaning. There is a stone slide for the kids and a fun dark cave to walk through. Spend more time in Pisac and at the llama farm on your way to Pisac",
          "Great Inca religious site. You will be amazed at how large the stones are and wonder how they were placed there. Our guide said they were rolled from a quarry and stacked using iron wood, planks and rope. Two different areas to climb up The views from the top were stunning. We",
          "We made the city tour with a small travel agency, our first point of visit was sacseyhuaman where we were impressed by such large, very well organized stones.",
          "Saqsaywaman (pronounced like \"sexy woman\") is located a few miles up the mountain on the outskirts of Cusco. This was once a fortress of the Incan Empire that ended in 1533 with the invasion of the Spanish Conquistadors. You maybe a little short on breath here due to this site",
          "Most of these amazing forts, temples leave me in wonder at how such massive stones were carved, carried and placed. Sacsayhuaman have the largest and most complex placement, some stones reported to weigh over 300 tonnes. The site, said to represent the head of a Puma is a work",
          "This place is amazing. If you will be in Cusco have to visit. It is one of the best atchrological sites in Peru. We visited this place in January and it was not overcrouded.",
          "This is probably the first place each tour wants to take you as it is so close to Cusco, but having visited much of the Sacred Valley after a week now - this is the one we would skip. Head to Chinchero, Moray and Pisac - much nicer in my opinion.",
          "We visited these ruins as part of some more, but these was the biggest and most impressive. I only wish we\u2019d have more time to wander about. It takes quite some time if you want to climb both sites in area. Unfortunately, we only had time to do once. Also, I would have liked",
          "Wr visit this place with Quinoa and over there we can saw big rocs and we had a good time. we enjoy saqsayhuaman archaelogical site.",
          "Well worth the little walk out of the city to get to (buses are available). The size of the site is incredible and great just to have a wander round to see all the structures. There are mini tours available to get more information on the use of the site originally and now. There",
          "Inca archeological site about 1200 feet above Cusco with well preserved Inca walls. You can walk up to the next level but if you\u2019re still getting used to the altitude it\u2019s a tough walk up the stairs.",
          "Me and my friends just went and wandered by ourselves! Very cool ruins with allot to see! We're could have kept walking to more ruins, but decided against it! Ran into a shaman who gave told us some cool history!",
          "We came here during a half day tour of the sites around Cusco and it is very beauitful. It's amazing to see how the Incas carved the rocks so perfectly together and hearing the history behind it. Great views of Cusco too!",
          "Located on the hills overlooking Cusco. Massive stonework that was too large to pillage and haul down to Cusco to build the cathedral and other city buildings. Well worth the trip up from Cusco.",
          "Walked (or hiked) from Plaza de Armas this morning, left around 0745 and it was perfect with no crowds! I really do recommend walking up but I have nothing to compare to. If you do walk, go past the Catedral del Cuzco (on the street just to the right), the benefit is you will",
          "Part of the Sacred Valley this was a wonderful place to see and this is a testament to the Incas that their building skills can still be seen in plenty today",
          "Great to visit, I'm not sure how they ever constructed these, however they had the use of technology that has been long forgotten. Amazing....",
          "Once again, to see up close how these cities and agricultural developments came to be, is truly fascinating. Not only are there great photographic sites here, but the area is so rich in history - explaining how the Spaniards conquered the Incan population.",
          "The history and the stories are amazing. But this spot is probably worth it alone just for the views of Cusco.",
          "This site is huge. Take your time. With respect to the altitude take a taxi/Uber up to the entrance and enjoy the easy walk back. The site also provide the best Arial view of Cusco.",
          "We made the city tour 1/2 day with a Cusco agency, Machu Picchu travel Peru was responsible for making this incredible tour, we were fascinated to visit these immense stones.",
          "Be sure to give yourself multiple hours to peruse this site. It\u2019s gigantic. There are views that cannot be matched anywhere else in Cusco!",
          "This place makes Stonehenge look like an amateurs practice piece. The sheer size and enormity of it is breathtaking.",
          "This stop was included as part of a larger tour and was worth a stop. The size and construction with the rocks is amazing. Its hard to understand how the large bolders could have been moved and sized to fit perfectly.",
          "Great display of Incan masonry. Way up in the topside of Cusco is a great Incan ruin. Definitely ride up if inclines are a challenge. The walk down takes you through some residential areas and into San Blas or the historic district.",
          "A very nice place, especially because I was not expecting such a majestic and great architecture. Highly recommended",
          "This place was so cool! It has a great but also unfortunate history but is very interesting. The scenery is great",
          "We wondered up one morning, all up hill but not difficult if fit and adjusted to altitude. This ruin was quite different with massive rocks and interesting to look around. Not crowded when we visited. Tourist ticket required - work out the sites you want to visit and buy the",
          "This is the place where Inti Raimy takes place every June 24th. The place is pacefull and you can go there taking a CityTour that long 4 hours and take you to 4 places for S/ 20. In the first stop, you can buy the ticket for 4 places or full ticket for 16 places that expires in",
          "They closed the ticket counter before you walk up the steep path to the monument. Once arrived up the hill they make you buy a ticket for 4 monuments (70 soles min.). We only wanted to visit this one. Very bad treatment of tourists. Why can\u2019t we just buy a ticket for this? And",
          "Sacsayhuam\u00e1n is a short trip from the centre of Cusco and it is well worth visiting. There is great history behind the site and it provides great views.",
          "These dramatic Inca ruins sit just above the Imperial city and should not be overlooked. With respect to the altitude take a taxi up to the entrance and enjoy the easy walk back. The site covers several acres-take your time, forget the selfies, imbibe the spirit of the Incas. If",
          "The Sacsayhuaman Fortress housed the Temple of the Sun, and is considered a milestone of military architecture, built during the reign of Tupac Yupanqui by a town that did not know the wheel, but was able to move stones of 300 tons.",
          "None of the photos do justice to this place. It is huge and made entirely by huge stones cut to an almost watertight fit. Some of these stones are estimated to be larger than 900 tons!",
          "It was a wonderful place to visit with great views of what the Incan people were able to build. Lots of symbols and history in one place.",
          "What views from here! We were here in December which is in the rainy season. It did not rain on us but everything was green and beautiful. Because it was low tourist season, there were few others there at the time we were, allowing for a very peaceful visit.",
          "Part of the Cusco City tour. Everyone kept referring to it as \"sexy woman\" but it is pronounced \"Sak-sai-wa-mon more or less. It's quite impressive.",
          "I really loved these temple ruins. The design and construction are beyond words and if you have a great tour guide understanding the history just makes the city of Cuzco a very special place. Take your time, sit, study digest the information and you will be changed.",
          "Many people only think of Machu Picchu when they think of the Incan empire, but there are many places within minutes of Cusco that are equally as impressive, Sacsayhuam\u00e1n being one of the best. It\u2019s a great window into the past, with a great view of Cusco, and all within 20",
          "This place is a must-see when you visit Cusco. There are three additional sites that you have to pay for in the entrance fee for this site. The price is 70 Soles, at about $20. The engineering is impressive and perfect for ancient people. If for no other reason to see for",
          "This is a must visit while in Cusco, the architectural and engineering skills of the Incas cannot be explained yet as this incredible rock buildings which had a lot of congruence with astrology and nature.",
          "Well preserved ruins of Inca temple. Best visited with a guide to learn about Inca construction and history. Given elevation, best to visit after being in Cusco a day or 2.",
          "I'll admit that by the time we got to Cusco and saw Saqsayhuaman, we were hitting up against ruin fatigue. We had already stayed in the Sacred Valley for 4 nights and seen several other sites. These ruins are somewhat different from the others, and there's less climbing than",
          "Very photogenic ruin with lots of interesting background stories. It is good to explore the whole site on foot and have a great panoramic view of the red-roof citiscape at the highest point. Take a 20-minute stroll down a very narrow street to Plaza de Armas is quite enjoyable.",
          "Just outside of the city of Cusco this site is well worth visiting for its amazing architecture and history during the Inca civilization. Home of that massive 130 ton boulder all the guides talk about! Go with a guide to maximize your visit!",
          "Sacsayhuaman has a lot of history reflected in its ruins, citadels and the rock formations. The hike up the site is not very strenuous and the views of the city from up top are amazing. It is definitely worth a visit when in Cusco.",
          "The citadel from where you can admire the panorama of the entire Cuzco along with the lamas that walk freely withing the walls.",
          "Be sure to plan 2-3 hours at this site - We did not use a guide but had read up on the site prior to going there. This worked well for us.",
          "We walked here from downtown Cusco and took a taxi back. It's possible to walk here but it will take you up many, many steps to get here. There is a small entrance fee.",
          "Hard to believe those Spaniards doubted the Incas. They were far more sophisticated in their art and technology. Their engineering skills were tremendous to see in person. So much reminded me of Egypt\u2019s sophistication.",
          "Our guide brought us here the last day of our trip. It was a great addition to our trip to Machu Piccu. Best part was the city overlook at the SE side. Fantastic views of Cusco and the valley.",
          "Large stones and very well designed, we took the city tour with a local agency of the city of Cusco and made a good service and were always well pending.",
          "Another impressive Incan site near Cusco, with a fascinating story to tell, and great views of the city",
          "I enjoyed learning about the history here and admiring the construction techniques. The views of the city from here were excellent, too.",
          "I enjoyed the trip at Sacksayhuaman, the view is breathtaking and the nature and ruins are amazing . Highly reccomended!",
          "We went there from cusco center. Was a nice walk to the top with a beautiful view down on the city. The historical side was huge, more then we expected. The price was just very high. We had to pay 70 soles at the entrance.",
          "I walked up to Sacsayhuaman to acclimatize when I arrived in Cuzco. This expansive site has many features typical of Inca architecture. It offers sweeping vistas of Cuzco too.",
          "This was an amazing site that many miss. The history and stonework is astounding. The scope and scale, along with the advanced Incan city planning, make this a special place with stunning Cusco views. I am stingy with 5 stars but is a 4.5!",
          "It was part of the archeological sites we visited on our city tour and of all of them in the city this was the one that we found most interesting of all!",
          "You can see a very large area with ruins including big walls made of stone with more than 4 sides. Also you can learn a little more about the Inca culture with the help of a tour guide.",
          "Just seeing the ruins without a guide may be difficult to appreciate what you see here. The significance of each part of the ruins was very interesting to hear about. Most entertaining was the slide. Seeing the grazing llama was unusual.",
          "Great inka site to learn more about the Incas and their way of life. The stones are a mystery as to the precision and placement. You can feel the energy when you are insite.",
          "Toured with Silverio of Banderitas Adventures in Cusco. Excellent, knowledgeable guide. Wonderful guidance what to bring, organized a perfect lunch/setting post.",
          "The apartment we rented was near the lower level entry to the park, but we opted to take a cab up to the higher elevation entry and walk down through the park. It was a wise move as the air is, of course, quite thin, especially for folks who don't normally live at elevation.",
          "It was a gorgeous day for a stroll through Sacsayhuaman. Before I continue, I have to say altitude sickness is very real. I did not think I would be affected by it, but I was. My head was hurting, I was out of breath and I even experienced a minor nose bleed. That being",
          "An important cultural site very easy to visit from Centro Historical Cusco. We picked up a guide at the gate and really appreciated their knowledge of the history.",
          "This is a lovely Incan temple that isn't jammed with too many tourists. The architectural structures are fascinating to view.",
          "Sacsayhuaman, just outside the city of Cusco offers some of the best remains of Inca structures and walls, but also the ultimate 180 degree view of Cusco from the very top. You can either walk (a strenuous 45 minute walk from the city center), or just take a cab, which are",
          "Our tour arrived a bit late there, but we managed to see the sunset from this amazing excavation spot",
          "You can find The Sacsayhuaman Ruins from Cusco by following the big white Jesus Statue. (Christo Blanco) Hike up there (Lots of steps!!!!) or just ask a taxi driver to take you up there. Just ask for Sacsayhuaman. (Pronounced \"Sexy Woman\") Most taxis in Cusco should be about 5",
          "From the historic center of Cusco we took a mirabus to all the surrounding ruins of Cusco and it was lovely to make it happen.",
          "Unbelievable examples of Inca stonework. The site is accessible without much climbing and gives an indication of how the original would have looked before it was vandalised by the Spanish and the smaller stones robbed to make their cathedral.",
          "An Inca site well worth a visit. The stonework is breathtaking and the view of Cusco from this vantage point is well worth while",
          "A real treat to see all of the ruins, lovely views too. A guide really explains it all too. A must visit",
          "Sacsayhuaman is far larger than meets the eye. Covers many acres and includes niches, cavern, aqueducts, altars, steps, doorways and walls. Amazing views of the remaining walls and megalithic structures.",
          "This fortress was monumental in size. It is just outside of Cusco which is believed that the city was laid out in the shape of a puma whose head was the hill of Sacsayhuaman. Standing beside these ruins makes you wonder how these monolithic stones were stacked one on top of",
          "Great spot to visit close to.the city centre. We didn't take a tour but still enjoyed walking the grounds and imaging bthe places roll in history!",
          "Heavy rain and wind made a visit to this Inca site impossible. Our guide tried his best but ultimately had to shorten the day trip.",
          "Quite a walk to the top, but worth it! Loads to look at. Might have been better with a guide to explain everything, but was still amazing to look at without a guide.",
          "This is a worthwhile visit. It is amazing how the city was built in the 1400's. Unfortunately no trace of that science was left behind as the Inca dispersed lest they should be killed by the invading Spaniards. For those that the invaders managed to contact could not be",
          "Amazing to learn more about the Incas and their way of life. The stones are a mystery as to the precision and placement. You can feel the energy",
          "We could not believe, how the Incas made this impressive place on the top of Cusco city? You will understand when you visit this spot, if you are planning to visit Machu Picchu do it too.",
          "An easy place as it's in walking distance from the centre of Cusco. A hilly, toughish but rewarding climb. An interesting site to see. Also a few minutes walk across to the Cristo Blanco statue. There are some awesome views across the city. Worth it at night too.",
          "Truly amazing how they constructed these buildings with massive tailor made blocks and no mortar. We had a guide who explained the history but even wandering around was awe inspiring. Leave at least one hour and have plenty water.",
          "The stone structure.architecture is very impressive. While it was a struggle for me to go up the top of the ruins, it was worth it. It was also very helpful that our guide gave really good information on what we're looking at.",
          "We had a much too short visit as part of a Cusco city tour. The Inca craftsmanship here was as impressive as any we saw on our trip. Would have liked to have more time to explore it more fully. It sounds like it is quite impressive lit up at night. Roaming lamas were a great",
          "we and friends visited this place before our hike, its unique and good for training day, from the top offers and really nice views to the city",
          "Need a stop there, the views are impressive and let you understand the way the kingdom was rule with places like Saqsayhuaman on all trails.",
          "The size of some of the stones and the scale of the construction is awesome, given the tools available back then. The views over Cusco are pretty good as well.",
          "Less famous than Macchu Piccu Inca site but very impressive with lightning wall not far from Cusco. Also fantastic views of Cusco.",
          "This is an impressive historical site which should be a \u201emust go\u201c goal for everyone who is visiting Cusco. Almost in the city this old ruins are giving an impressive view to former Inca times ...",
          "We primarily went to see Machu Picchu. Ended up being more taken by this than any other place in Peru. Loved it.",
          "You have to visit this wonderous place when you're in cusco. It is very big and preserved well. So magical to see these special stones, carved to perfection and fit together perfectly. I loved this place!",
          "Part of our day trip up into the Sacred Valley, we went to Sacsayhuaman area to see the ruins of walls and terraces. Pretty large area to see, so a bit of walking to do. We were fortunate also to a large herd of multi-coloured alpacas wondering through close-by.",
          "We were couple of hours in the center of cusco city where you get to see old colonial and Inca buildings that are surrounding the centre of Cusco.",
          "huge stones decorated in perfect harmony togueter you need to vist this place is a must on your visit to Cusco",
          "Interesting big stones, but a short visit was enough on a really sunny day with no shade to find for shelter.",
          "It\u2019s quite impressive to see how they stacked up these large stones so perfectly. Big park with great views of the city as well. It was part of our tour, but it\u2019s not far out of the city so I would include it in your itinerary if you\u2019re making your own plans",
          "This is one of the best stops of the city tour. The archaeological site is magnificent to say the list.",
          "These ruins are only a few kilometers from the Old Town. There are a lot of walls but was told nearly 70% are reconstructed....that's ok because what is there is beautiful. Went through one of the caves...very small and very dark.",
          "People on our tour said that aliens must have built it, our guide did not see the funny side of that !! It is amazing to see the exactness of the stonework, massive blocks of granite carefully carved to fit into each other, and not just one or two, but hundreds of them.",
          "We spent a few hours here. Hope home As testing but it is worth it. Beware of the scammers at the bottom of the entrance gate trying to sell you different tickets, just walk past and get the official ones for 70soles at the top.",
          "Remarkable place and you\u2019ll just stand there and ask yourself how did they do this.......those stones are massive and fit together perfectly. Huge complex to walk round just a shame the top layer has been pilfered for building materials but no one is moving that bottom layer!!!",
          "I hired a private taxi to take me here as well as three other sites close by. A huge site. Need to allow at least two hours to appreciate.",
          "This archeological site is amazing as it still has mysteries for some. the size of those giant boulders used for the construction, the fact the spaniards when they arrived thought it must have been the work of demons and not of men, etc. it is really an incredible site. too bad",
          "I took the local bus up the hill for like a dollar. It leaves from east of town, which was also a nice walk. It was so easy, it was ridiculous. You stop at the posted area until the huge bus that says \"blanco christo\" on it comes, and then you get off at \"blanco christo,\"",
          "We had bought the boleto touristico covering us for 10 days. After seeing the ruins of Pisac, Machu Picchu, Ollantayambo, and Moray, we still were impressed to visit this site with the largest rocks! It was quite windy and drizzly so we didn't spend an extensive amount of time",
          "When you see the size of these boulders, and see there are not spaces between them for a knife, and realize it was built without modern day machines---the only word I can think of is WOW!",
          "if you're in Cusco, you simple have to visit Sacsayhuaman. Its about 20/30 min walk from the center of town (plus remember the altitude is a real thing). Typically spend 1hr 30mins here looking at this amazing site. Don;t forget to walk to the far edge to slide on the 'Inca",
          "Just go. Close to town, amazing site, introduces you to Inca culture and architecture. Buy your tourist tickets in town.",
          "I took a day stroll from Cusco to see this. Its spprox 2km from the main square uphill but worth the visit. From there you can walk to the christ statue. Take plenty of water csuse its all out in the open with little shade",
          "A quick 1-2 hours walk tour from Cusco center plaza. If you just arrived, or have few hours left before dinner time, it is an easy reach out target for killing time. The view is very nice as you can see the whole Cusco city from the top",
          "beautiful place very close to the center of the city, I spent much of my time in this archaeological center taking pictures, the environment and landscape make the visit special. tip: don't forget your raincoats (just in case)",
          "This is a good place to get familiar with the Incas. It is essential to have an guide who speaks your language. Otherwise, it will not make much sense.",
          "This palace has the biggest stones ensembled like a puzzle each stone has a history to tell us. Was the scenario of the final battle between the Incas and the Spaniard invaders. Unfortunately, the Spaniards destroyed most of the place! But, the remains still been magnificent!",
          "Enjoyed having a walk around this site. Bigger than most Inca sites, and has beautiful views of Cusco. You can easily walk from the town centre to here or taxi. Also from here you can visit other Inca sites around Cusco. Making it a good day out explore history around the city.",
          "The wonders of the Inca terracing at Sacsayhuaman are a must see if you visit Cusco. We found the guide we had really brought the history of the place to life, and the way the terrrace walls were constrcuted is truly incredible. best to get there early though to avoid the crowds.",
          "Is a great Monument to lear about the last battle that the Incas fight, plus gets you thinking how they move those giants rocks its just perfect",
          "A pleasant stop particularly if you have just arrived in Cusco and want to take it easy and adjust to the altitude. Take a guide to learn about the fascinating history.",
          "A magical experience! This temple really moved me. I enjoyed learning the story and the uses of this temple. I felt strong energy coming from the earth and the stones here. We had an amazing shaman (medicine man) Jhaimy from Children of the 7 rAys as a guide. So we got the",
          "Great example of Incan engineering, and if you go with a guide, a great history lesson on Incan astronomy. Large site so be prepared to walk if you plan to explore fully.",
          "Another must while in Cusco. Best way to do this is to have a taxi drive you up and wait while you see the scenery. We did it in 60 minutes but wish we had about 90 minutes to 2 hours.",
          "Learned so much about the Incas from this place and how they built these walls earthquake proof, strong and protective. Recommended for anyone to see!!",
          "It's best to visit with a guide - you'll get far more out of the visit. The history of the area is fascinating. It's a huge place, with walls built without mortar using enormous stones. I'd seen pictures but the reality is absolutely stunning. Just how did they move stones",
          "Komeyer was our local guide and is full of knowledge about the Inca's and the area. We learned a great deal of history from him.",
          "Nice Inca archaeological site to visit. It was very busy and the entrance fee is quite pricey (S/70 pp). I would of thought with the cost of entry you would at least get a paper guide / map etc. But nothing! This does make it difficult when walking around to know the actual",
          "The place is breathtaking. It is spacious and beatiful. You will be amazed by the Inca's stones. love",
          "amaizing to witness first hand the remains of the product of great lost technology. stone masonry of unparalleled modern achievements. a must se when visiting Peru and Cusco.",
          "Amazing to see what the Incans accomplished. This is an archeological site, and the best way to see it is with a knowledgeable guide or guided tour. Watch for dogs. They run freely. Also, the locals will try to sell their wares at the exit of this site.",
          "It\u2019s really nice to visit alone without any guide. This Inka heritage is well maintained and huge which means you can spend lots of time here to see the difference between buildings. My suggestion is not to follow the city trip to visit here because 1 or 2 hours are totally not",
          "We walked up to Sacsayhuaman from our hotel - it looks far on a map but is actually about a 20 minute walk from the Plaza De Armas. The entrance ticket covers Sacsayhuaman and a number of other nearby sites and costs S./ 70 for a day ticket. Be sure to have cash as the ticket",
          "We walked up from Cusco and then paid a local to drive us in the back gates for a lower fee than the government fee at the gate. We did not hire a guide. I just wanted to see the site and I have read enough on my own to make my way around. I could have spent the day laying",
          "Good for folks with history mind to appreciate place better. It\u2019s barren . Moderate walking to do. Amazing how they could handle those massive stones.",
          "We had couple of hours to explore the site, the moment we parked , with thunder and lightening, a hail storm started !! Hailstones the size of golf balls .. so we ended up waiting in the van for half hour and the storm died down to a drizzle. We braved the wet and explored as",
          "So interesting but you need a personal guide to talk you through the history. Absolutely fascinating. Masses of Inca buildings - insight into their way of life. Definitely need a camera & good walking shoes and take it easy, slow walking - the altitude sickness is real &",
          "Sacsayhuaman (or Saqsayhuaman) is an Inka city / location that is must-see for people visiting Cusco. The ruins are at the top of the hill above the city, with beautifully preserved walls and military fortification. Taxi from the city center to the ruins is about 10-12 Soles.",
          "A not to be missed archeological site. Will have you leaving with more questions than answers about the history of the Earth.",
          "We visited the site as part of the city tour. It is a good way to get started although can be missed with no regret if you visit other sites in the valley. The view is cool but similar views are accessible in the city.",
          "We booked a private tour, in advance, with Inkayni Peru Tours through their website. The process was quite simple and they did follow up with me, via email, to confirm our arrangements. This would be our first day in Peru. We were picked up at our Cusco hotel and our first stop",
          "Beautiful site to learn about the fortress and how they protected cusco. Nice city views but not too time consuming to visit.",
          "Great place to visit. Very interesting history. Great views of the area from here. Climbing around the ruins made for a great morning.",
          "Was really pretty but was quite crowded. Had to wait to walk anywhere for multiple people to finish taking photos.",
          "It is a small version of Machu Picchu, which makes it worth seeing it only if you do not plan to visit MP, otherwise it is a pale copy of it. Close to the Cristo Blanco, on the top of a hill, from where one has a very nice view of Cusco.",
          "In a half day tour of Cusco and surrounding area, our guide Oda of Vegetarian Peru took us here. It was the first of many Inca sites we would see in the coming days and this one is particularly large. Helped set the stage for additional sites we were to see.",
          "Despite the weather not being so great we certainly did enjoy seeing and walking around Sacsayhuaman that afternoon in mid-October. It was interesting to see all of the huge, tall boulders and carvings and wonder how did the Incas do that way back when. The Incas and all they",
          "A place of historical importance. It will make you wonder about the knowledge of Incas on stone work.",
          "Great place. Not much to see other than the ruins. Great view of Cusco. Climb is steep and we took a cab",
          "Very interesting site, incredible piece of history and amazing to see the work of these people so many hundreds of years ago! Compares in magnitude with Egyptian Pyramids",
          "Great please to venture out to. No need for a guide and a must while visiting Cusco. Great place to take pictures of Cusco.",
          "This is amazing how they moved these stones and fit htem togeather. It is easy tour and cheap taxi ride",
          "Mind blowing mega construction. It's amazing to try to think of how the ancient people built these monuments.",
          "We visited Sacsayhuaman as part of a post-cruise excursion. Our guide Diego was incredible. He explained everything in great detail and with such passion that we will always remember the story behind Sacsayhuaman.",
          "There is so much more to experience from Saqsaywaman that what we normally see in travel shows. First of all, it\u2019s a lot bigger than I thought. You can actually walk through the ruins, walk through doorways, and climb stairs built by the Incans. They also have a cave system that",
          "We made a city tour with a local agency in Cusco and thanks to our guide we were able to know everything about the history and how they invaded Peru.",
          "These ruins are unbelievable. It's amazing how it survived the test of time and weather. The Inka history if fascinating and reveals much about their intelligence as a people",
          "This sight is very helpful in understanding the Inca civilization and is a good introduction to the building materials and wall construction of the Incas.",
          "There are quite a few ruins to see around Cusco but these ones are to me the best. They are big, clean, nice and not ressemble Machu Picchu too much so if you spend time there you won't be ruin fatigued when you reach Picchu",
          "Massive ancient stone structures, all precisely fit with NO CEMENT. They have survived earthquake after earthquake. Our guide told us that the pre-Incan and Incan builders moved these giant stones without using wheels either. Mind blown. In the meantime down in the cities,",

          "That Cusco contained this Incan architectural marvel. Very impressive and historic. Well worth a visit.",
          "Cusco area has other more interesting and vast archeological sites (such as Pisac and Ollantaytambo), but this one is ridiculously close to the city and offers a nice view over it.",
          "Don't let Machu Pichu be your only focus. This place is amazing as well, and so convenient to get to.",
          "This is a citadel found up on a hill by Cusco. I suggest walking up to the site as you get stunning views of Cusco on the way up. The site itself is massive and requires a few hours to get through however you won't be disappointed. Some of the craftsmanship of the stonework is",
          "It's beautiful and difficult to understand how they build it with such large rocks. Awesome place to visit and very close to Cusco.",
          "This fortress high above Cusco has some of the most impressive Incan stonework you will see. Some of the pieces are massive, weighing more than a 100 tons. Just marvel at the craftsman's skill.",
          "This is the site of an ancient fortress that offers fantastic views of Cusco. This was a religious site as well as the scene of battles between the Inca forces and Spanish invaders.",
          "Easily reach from Cusco either by walking, Uber or taxi. A very large Inca ruin and it would be a great if you can hire a guide to explain the ruin. A sad history of what the Spanish did when it conquered the Inca.",
          "Unfortunately it rained quite heavily while we were viewing this site. It was interesting but as we were here as part of a city tour, a longer look round would have been beneficial as it is quite spread out in parts. There is a viewing platform which affords great views over",
          "James from Two Worlds Peru showed us around Cusco, starting with Sacsayhuaman. He educated on so many fascinating details of this old Incan fortress/temple.",
          "You get a two for one - both fascinating inka ruins and an amazing view of the Cusco. It's uphill to get there, but so worth all the steps! Recommend to go here before noon and then catch lunch in one of the great caf\u00e9s on the way back to the center of the city.",
          "We had Dany, from Amazing Andean Adventures and his extensive knowledge of history to make this site come alive! Otherwise, its just more rocks. Nearby Cusco and real alpaca goods stores. Easy walking.",
          "Large stones, something very fantastic with a lot of history, something advisable to visit if you come to Peru to visit.",
          "They were engineer, I am at a loss as to how this construction came together! If you can't visit Machu Picchu, at least come here to get a good feeling for the awesomeness of the planning and construction of these ancestors, nice place to see and walk around the inca temple.",
          "Can recommend a visit to this Inka ruin Tempel in Cusco. It cost 70 soles and it's worth it, as the stones are placed in a zig zag way, suppose to be a Puma. Very nice view of Cusco from this place. Can recommend this to people who likes history.",
          "We took the city tour that was offered to us and the most beautiful part was this place, a place full of a lot of history to tell, it was really incredible to be here.",
          "We spent about an hour there, but could have spent much longer. Our tour was informative and very affordable. The ruins are majestic and the views of Cusco did not disappoint. We walked over to the mini-Christ the Redeemer statue nearby, don't miss that one.",
          "The tour was very informative and it\u2019s unbelievable how the Incas were able to move those big chunks of stone and construct a temple up in the mountains!",
          "We visited this site on a private tour with Peru Summit as our first introduction to the amazing construction abilities of the Incas. Each site in the Sacred Valley is different, try to see as many as possible.",
          "This was our first visit to an Inca fortress and we were not disappointed. We were amazed and astounded by the workmanship that went into this fortress. Our guide was so knowledgeable and was able to provide us with a history of how and why the fortress was built. Definitely",
          "This place is amazing, a must stop when you visit peru, the history of it all is breathtaking just made me want more of this city",
          "One can understand this place only with a guide. Otherwise it is just stones and slides. Mayukmarca is the eye of the puma that is cusko. It gives a good photo.op of the city. Volcanic rocks hav created slides for children to enjoy. 'Echo point' was a good shouting match. Snake",
          "This is a really interesting site with views of the city below and unlike most Inca sites it is spread over a large area.",
          "Must see this place if you're in Cusco, incredible architecture by the inka, easily accessible from town, really impressive",
          "Bring plenty of beers and a picnic basket. There are many Inca rock walls scattered on hills overlooking Cusco, but be prepared for weather conditions.",
          "I visit just about all the most noteworthy ruins available for viewing in the Sacred Valley and, even though we visited Sacsayhuaman after visiting the rest of the Valley and Machu Picchu, still found them to be quite impressive and unique from others",
          "During the city tour we did, we visited a very impressive archaeological complex full of huge and well-carved stones simply something beautiful to see.",
          "Definitely the best of the four main archeological sites outside Cusco. Very popular, best to be seen with a local guide who will explain the ingenuity of the building skills of the Incas.",
          "Visit early in the day before the crowds as this is a popular site. It would be difficult to interpret without a guide, but our guide Omar was fantastic, explaining many of the key features, pointing our viewpoints and giving us time to take photos and look at areas at our own",
          "Stop and take in the amazingness of this place. Make sure you listen to the history behind the building of these walls.",
          "We had a nice guide that showed us how incredible it is to be in this place simply recommended thanks.",
          "Why us this site so poorly interpreted? There are nothing more than arrows to point the way and some places are named...but no explanation. There is no onsite places selling Site books or maps. Could be that the guides (everywhere available ) would object. I do not mean to",
          "Amazing view of Cusco from here. The ruins are neat to see. They did a reenactment while we were here too and that was very cool to watch. I'm not sure how often they do it though. Definitely a must see while in Cusco.",
          "Definitely need a good guide to understand & appreciate this historic site. Also need a hat to protect yourself from the sun and a bottle of water. When you see the huge rocks used in the construction and how well these rocks have been used, you have to marvel at the",
          "This was included in Sacred Valley Tour. Got some hiking in. Beautiful scenery and tour guide very knowledgeable.",
          "This place is enormous and makes you marvel at the architectural wizardry of the Incan people. They were certainly up there with the ancient Egyptians when it comes to monumental stone structures built without mortar. A must see place.",
          "Our local guide, Raoul, did a fantastic job of outlining the layout and describing how the site was built and used.",
          "Close to Cusco centre - take a taxi if you want to spare your feet. Find yourself a guide on site (a knowledgeable one for 90 minuets - 50 soles), enjoy the view, and discover the history of the Incas in the ruins of their architecture. Well worth the trip",
          "MachuPicchu gets all the raves, and it is fantastic, but Peru has so much more to offer. Sacsayhuaman is easy to get to and there's so much to see. I would go with a guide who can give you more information about the entire area, as just a few miles from this site are several",
          "Sacsayhuaman is a really interesting site. Get a guide if you can as they tell you a lot more of the history to it. The only downside is the tickets are a bit expensive",
          "Excellent ruins of an Inca fortress. Some noted history took place here. We used a hotel car round trip, less than US$15 round trip including tip to driver. Entry fee is included in the boleto turistico. No guide is necessary if you have a good guide book. Well worth the 2 hours",
          "Some of the best ruins we saw in Peru (aside from Machu Pichu- without the crazy crowds). Amazing to see how well the inca cut stones to fit together so well! Also has a cool stone slide at the back that our group enjoyed too much!",
          "It was an impressive view and walls, coupled with some historical notes about the place. Definitely recommended for a visit.",
          "Sacsayhuaman, the massive fortified complex of is the most significant ruin in Cusco, and is close enough to the historic center that you can walk there. You do have the option of hiring a taxi to drive you up, but I chose to walk from the plaza, but be ready as it is well above",
          "As an engineer, I am at a loss as to how this construction came together! If you can't visit Machu Picchu, at least come here to get a good feeling for the awesomeness of the planning and construction of these ancestors!",
          "One of the world\u2019s most magical and mystical cities that oozes history, extraordinary architecture, archaeological sites, museums and so many places to visit. After 3 trips, it is definately my favourite South American city because it offers so much more. Buy the Boleto",
          "The site is I.pressive because it is really big and quite well preserved. Unfortunately we had had some bad experiences with guides and therefore decided not to take one... we probably should have taken a guide to understand better what we were looking at... Overall quite",
          "In Peru to visit Machu Picchu, I was unaware of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n. It is not to be missed. An important Incan architectural site. Overwhelmed at the size of some of the rocks and how the Inca engineers were able to move the boulders and stack the rocks using no mortar.",
          "Lonely mountain top archeological excavation, lots of questions and wonder at 12000 feet. Not a lot of visitors so there wasn\u2019t a feeling of being crushed by the crowds or rushed.",
          "We saw just about all the most noteworthy ruins available for viewing in the Sacred Valley and, even though we visited Sacsayhuaman after visiting the rest of the Valley and Machu Picchu, still found them to be quite impressive and unique from others. You could def walk to this",
          "Great hike from Plaza de Armas. It is straight uphill. You will be winded. Great views. Know the particulars of entry pass. If you will see the sacred valley, get the full pass. If not, the local entry is fine. We did 1/2 day Sacsayhuman and hilltop then full day sacred valley.",
          "These ruins were a 3 level fortification. Massive stones some as high as 17 feet and weighing 350 tons were perfectly aligned and fitted together to form the walls of the fortress. After the Spanish conquered the Incas here, many of the walls were destroyed and the stone was",
          "We paid a guide on-site (in Spanish) to take us around the ruins. He was so enthusiastic and had been doing this for about 20 years! He taught us so much and really made the experience worthwhile.",
          "We took the steps from Cusco to Sacsayhuaman instead of a taxi, and its pretty easy to find, you can also stop on the way up to get lovely views of the city. Christo Blanco is not far from here also. Our guide was 50 soles which was quite lot in comparison to other places and",
          "While we were here touring this site, the temperature was 65 degrees and we got a sunburned head and face. The air is thin so if one has trouble breathing, think hard before going to visit. We were told by our guide that this is a big temple site where the Incas would gather",
          "Make sure to visit \u201csexy woman\u201d in your visit to Cusco. And plan plenty of time. We were a bit rushed due to scheduling and really wanted more time to explore otherwise a wonderful site to behold.",
          "The view from the top is beautiful. The ruins themselves are quite interesting and quite large but it was the view that really made an impression. There were also alpacas there that we could watch and even pet (they didn't really like it but were nice enough to tolerate it).",
          "Spent about an hour at this beautiful Inca site. We had a very knowledgeable guide who told us it\u2019s history. The boulders are stunning, some weighing between 1 to 1.5 tons and so perfectly laid without mortar.",
          "Stunning fortress with huge stones, truly impressive Inca structure. Our tour guide was excellent, explained many historical facts we were not aware of. Truly enjoyed the experience.",
          "Took the advice of a couple TA reviewers, took the taxi up and then walked down to city center. Once in the park, the Inca ruins are very impressive, you need to spend a hour to 2 hours to explore. Then take in the aerial views of the city. Warning make sure you have enough",
          "Very cool, formerly impenetrable fortress that was one of the main bases of the Incas. Up close look at some amazing construction and huge original stones. Beautiful weather. We saw the fortress as part of the four Ruins (great way to do it) starting with Tambomachay and working",
          "I did this site without a guide. It was a beautiful spot above Cusco. A great way to spend an hour or two. Try the slide etched out of the stone. Don't wear hiking pants though. People in jeans faired better than I. I flew down propelled by my slick pants.",
          "I recommend you get a tour guide while visiting here. They give you a great insight into the Incan culture and makes the visit much more enjoyable and informative.",
          "Above Cusco with a nice view on the nice. Great Inca side, you have to come here, but you need the \"bolero touristico\".",
          "Go here with a knowledgeable guide. The historic value of Inca and pre-Inca is immeasurable. Walking is required and without a guide details in the stone can be missed.",
          "You could spend a lot of time here or do what we did and do a quick walk through in 30 mins. You can easily get the flavour you need in this time - fundamentally military architecture on three levels. Our guide was able to pick out the main interesting bits without us walking",
          "As part of a guided tour we visited as a small group, seeing the massive stone slabs, fitted and placed to form a huge meeting place and water storage",
          "Very enjoyable afternoon visiting these ruins and getting to view Cusco from the top. Fairly gentle climb. Very interesting historical perspective from our guide.",
          "Took a tour bus here. However, I think it may be walking distance from historic city center Cusco. Albeit, up hill going. Must see!",
          "Very close to downtown Cusco, it\u2019s an amazing site due to the location and history about it, still used during the Inti Raymi.. the bad thing is that each CityTour takes thousands of tourists at the same time, which is uncomfortable",
          "I have seen it 2x, once on the double decker bus, very cold at night, bring a feather coat or wear an Alpaca pucho, or thermal gloves and clothes, my friend had 1 for 200 soles after bargaining for 80 soles less in Cusco near Plaza de Armas (much cheaper prices vs the touristic",
          "Very interesting site and a great way to start my exploration of the Cuzco area and Incan architecture.",
          "We got up early and took a taxi for 10 soles from the plaza. We beat the crowds and tours. Was lovely to walk around the site and view of Cusco city. We then took a taxi to the church at the bottom of road and walked back into Cusco about 10 mins.",
          "We hiked all the way up. It's worth the view. When we got there we realized we needed a guide. So we asked to hire an official guide who spoke English. Unfortunately, the guide didn't speak that great English. That was a little disappointing. Overall an impressive place to",
          "Amazing fortress with beautiful view of Cusco. You can walk for it from the city but you need to be ready to climb many steps. Entrance Ticket is 70 Sol.",
          "This is definitely worth a visit, not sure it's worth a paid tour but other reviewers seem to have had good experiences. Maybe if the tour is packaged for multiple archaeological sites? Otherwise if you enjoy the freedom of walking around on your own, this place is nice. We",
          "This is one of the best places to visit. But it\u2019s included in the boleto turistica. There are many mire places to visit in this area without paying so much.",
          "We did a temple tour. Was truly a delight to have a guide and get filled in on the local Peruvian culture. I have toured Chichen Itza and the similarities are stunning. Being from Canada this was a true treat!",
          "This is a quiet archaeological site that almost everyone that visits Cusco comes to see, however, just walking thru here is not good enough. to really bring out the essence of this wonderful site, I recommend that you get local guide and get a complete picture of what this site",
          "The displays of Inca architecture here were astounding! You can almost visualize this ancient place alive with color and a busy market. It is truly breathtaking....especially at that altitude ;-)",
          "Travelled from city 15 soles in Uber. Entry was easy and at 70s each. It\u2019s a large site with significant ruins and we had a great time walking around being amazed at how these sites were built. We got there early with a great view of Cuzco and surrounding area. A bonus highlight",
          "Great place to see large ruins and take in the Cusco views. Paid I think 25 sol to get in but you can get a ticket that lets you into multiple sites. Worth spending at least an hour here.",
          "We paid 70sole per person to see the ruins. We expected there would be some infographics and comments to the things we could see. NO WAY. There was nothing! We took few pictures and left the place after 45minutes. Dissappointment.",
          "Even though the place suffered long years of pillage during the colonial days, it's remains are more than enough to amaze anyone. Sure you can read about the Incas' feats elsewhere, but to stand next to stones the size of a house that fit perfectly toghether is definitely",
          "We did a photography tour of this inca ruin and wow wow wow. the structures of this incredible inca site is amazing.",
          "So interesting how the Inka\u2019s viewed the areas, sun and moon etc. Sacred Valley ruins are more impressive, but worth a visit.",
          "Sacsayhuaman is a wow-place, if you have a guide. The story about the Inkas is so amazing. (Make sure the guide have the knowledge). You will enjoy the 1,5h so much more with a guide than without. So much to know about this place.",
          "This is at the end of town up a street that feels like it takes twelve years to climb, but totally worth it to get acclimated to the altitude. It costs 70 sol for the day or 140 I think for the whole pass.",
          "I started my trip here, as it was my first day in cusco I was pretty out of breath walking up due to the altitude but well worth the trip. Amazing to see such incredible stone work. Also if it looks cloudy wear suncream regardless, I was a tad red after \ud83d\ude48",
          "Worth visiting. Spectacular structures. You will meet interesting people there.i don't see a whole lot of value to guided tour. You will get the gist of it.",
          "This site isn't as big as Machu Picchu but impressive in it's own right. Another amazing example of Inca stone movement and placement.",
          "What an unusual place and so beautiful. It\u2019s huge and the architectural work is just amazing. Highly recommend you go here on a tour because there\u2019s so much to learn and so much that still not known. If you\u2019re in Cusco do not mess",
          "This was a highlight of our trip. At 12,600 ft the highest place I have ever visited. Amazing engineering skills to build such a place so many years ago. A must see if you are in Peru",
          "We had the good fortune to secure Percy Salas as our tour guide while visiting Cuzco, Peru. Percy provides incredible knowledge of his Country, it\u2019s culture, it\u2019s history and what he sees as its future. He is more than a tour guide, he is a pseudo Ambassador for Peru. He speaks",
          "We walked up to Sacsayhuam\u00e1n from our hotel roughly .7 miles away. This was great exercise and the park did not disappoint. The entry fee is a little pricey but if you appreciate ancient engineering and an epic view of the city it is worth the visit. We opted to explore",
          "We took a Colectivo bus from Cusco to Pisac and got off at Tambomachay. We saw the ruins there then walked down (stopping at Puka Pulkara and Qenko) to Sacsayhuaman. The site is breathtaking- the size of the rocks used is mind blowing. We also enjoyed taking in the view of Cusco",

          "The size and engineering of these stones is very impressive, especially if have not been to see the Egyptain pyramids. A must see, part of Cusco half-day tour.",
          "This place has the largest stone among all Inca buildings. Walking on the three-tier remains gives you a good view of Cusco city.",
          "This is the 2nd stop of our half day tour to visit sacasayhuaman in Cusco. A history of magnificent structure, one of the most important military based in Inca empire. The whole ruin is a hugely impressive work of enormous stones putting together. Some of these stones are over",
          "Sacsayhuaman is an ancient Inca fortress approximately 2 kilometers from Plaza de Armas, the main square in Cusco. The foreboding location is expansive. Lots of walking if you want to see every nook and cranny of this complex. The massive sizes of some rocks were something to",
          "Sacsayhuaman is one of those places that still is keeping the beauty of the arquitecture. You can find different tour companies around plaza de armas that offer tours to this place. They basically have the same program and different prices. Pick up the one that is more",
          "Such a great place! To fully appreciate it I highly recommend to get a local guide to visit the ruins. The cost for the two hours visit of the ruins was 60 soles/20 USD. Our guide Edmundo was so knowledgeable, a history graduate.",
          "Beautiful sunset hike! We hiked up part way then hopped in a taxi for 5 minutes so we coul visit prior to closing at 6 pm. The taxi helped get us up more quickly. Sasquawaman is a huge site; it felt like a special and sacred journey, complete with alpacas!",
          "What an amazing landmark not far from Cusco .... definitely worth a visit for a couple of hours Get yourself a guide to help u understand the history and the events of the past here.",
          "Can't imagine what was here before the spanish. The scale is remarkable and intricate. Worth absolutely every second of the walk.",
          "It is amazing that this was built with rudimentary tools. Clearly the builders were very skillful. Many of the stones are huge. We were told that they were moved into place with log sleds and levers. You can climb up a narrow set of stone stairs to get a better view. There",
          "very nice I just don't like the merchants that stop selling and the infromal guides of free walk through the horrible city these rude people",
          "Sasayhuaman (Sexymamma) is an amazing example of Inka engineering and Architecture and a must see while in the Cusco Region. The most impressive is the size of the stones and the fitting of these stone too one another Getting a guide will be advisable so you don\u2019t miss the",
          "Beautiful views. We were blessed with a knowledgeable and interesting tour guide. I would recommend taking your time and not rushing to do this till you have acclimatised fully.",
          "We arrived in Cusco the day before and decided to walk up to Sacsayhuaman \u2014 we wanted to acclimate for our trek. It was a great experience. We did take up the offer from a local guide at the entrance and would highly recommend that option for the equivalent of $15USD. There is",
          "Well worth a visit to experience Inca architecture which is mind blowing from a construction standpoint with tools available at the time.",
          "Make sure you visit this when in Cusco. You might be thinking to yourself \" how many more Inca ruins can i see?\" This one is definitely a must see. Just stand in front of these giant boulders and imagine how they were moved and fitted without the use of any metal tools. I am",
          "I would love to be able to say that you can view this one on your own, but it will just look like broken down Inca site if you do. The site does not have explanations on what you are looking at and I think having a guide is a must on this site. The stones are in the multiple",
          "Excellent, the place is the foundation of getting to know the Inka civilization surrounded Cusco, is part of 4 sites in the same route. It\u2019s very informative and interested.",
          "Very cool ruins! We got a private tour guide which was a great way to learn about what we were seeing! Also love all the wild alpacas and llamas eating grass! Make sure to see the natural rock slides too!",
          "We visited the Saqsaywaman ruins while visiting Cusco. These are spectacular ruins with an amazing history. I would highly recommend that you book a tour guide take you through the these and other local ruins or perhaps include in a Cusco city tour (we did both). We had the best",
          "It is difficult to understand how this place was built and only 20 percent remains well worth the time to visit",
          "We took a taxi up to the site. It cost 10 soles. They wanted 25 soles for them to wait for us. We gambled and fortunately were able to find a taxi to take us back down to the Plaza de Armas for 7 soles. The stones were definitely impressive as was the view of Cusco. We chose not",
          "How incredible to visit this historic site. I was blown away thinking how the Incas built this place of celebration and worship of Mother Earth. It was significantly colder and windier there than in Cusco, so prepare accordingly.",
          "The ruins of the Inca fortress with hugh stone blocks, built over 2 hils, the Sun and Moon, are truley impressive and well worth a visit, ideally with a guide to explaine the history of the site. Special tip! if you just want photos of the walls, take the open top bus tour",
          "Quite amazing how these were made. Up a large climb. Recommend picking up a map from the tourist information office before you go Easy walking distance from Cusco centre",
          "We visited this place as part of our tour is Cusco and it was interesting to learn a out this temple and it's use. Going without a guide would not be as informative, just some stones, stairs and terraces. Learning about the way it was built, it's purpose and it's end was",
          "A very nice place, walking distance from Cusco Center Plaza de las Armas. Bring some water if your visit is during summer time",
          "The visit to this place was our fist tour of Cusco. The Tour Guide (Hugo) did an Excellent job in explaining the highlights and history Sacsayhuaman. This is one place I will recommend people or friends to visit.",
          "The visit to this place was our first stop on our private tour for the ruins closer to the city of Cusco. The guide did a great job explaining the highlights of this important place in a language that the youth in our group could understand",
          "We say all the main sites, but great to have the opportunity in seeing some of the smaller ruins as each have unique formations. This was a great stop on the tour.",
          "This is an incredible work of architecture, it is a great ruin to visit and it is so close to Cusco!",
          "Big site, gives an impression of the massive architecture built by the Inka. A hike up from town, recommend a taxi.",
          "We walked up from our bnb. It was a little steep at the end, but certainly do-able. We recommend renting a guide for the tour. Make sure you try the labyrinth and the slide!",
          "It was really impressive to see how the walls were put together. Amazing craftsmanship. Great views over Cusco.",
          "Large Inca ruins overlooking the city of Cusco and worth the drive up to top. So much history and engineering in the ruins.",
          "The ruins are worth visiting. It is an easy walk from San Blas. There is also an amazing view point on Cusco.",
          "We got a taxi to the site as we had claimed MP mountain the day before. It was only 15S from town. Huge stones in the walls that make you wonder how they did it. You can spend about 1.5-2hrs here and then combine it with a short walk to the Christ Statue. We walked back to town",
          "Toured this site with our guide Jorge from Lima tours - if you are in Cusco it is a must see - another Incan sore that just blows your mind especially when discussing architecture",
          "We just bought the partial ticket to do this and Qengo. Incredible size and scope! More impressive than we expected.",
          "I will admit I was hesitant to see this place. However our travel guide Jimmy had lots of knowledge and made the tour enjoyable. The ruins are breathtaking and it feels surreal being surrounded by so much history. The stones are massive and I can not imagine how they were cut",
          "I think this is the mini MP. But the open space was so huge huge that you could spend half a day exploring. The inca walls built by massive stones was fascinating. Didnt had enough time hence we just walk a short distance but manage to spot some apaca around the area. It would",
          "We had this as part of a day tour so spent about an hour here but you could easily spend half a day here walking up the hills and seeing the full sight. The animal shapes in the wall, the intricate steps and zig zag walls. Amazing look back at Incan life.",
          "When you get to Cuzco, head to the Tourism office and buy the 'Big Ticket' for all the tourist sites. Then, buy a lunch and plan to spend a day here! We didn't understand the ticketing system at first, as this was our first site, and it took us a while to get our tickets and get",
          "Amazing tour we took thru PeruForLess, with Mary, describing cultural and archeological significance and history of this site and it's people.",
          "Take an early afafternoon when in Cusco. Climb up all the way to the site. You will feel the satisfaction once you will reach the top and catch your breath. The site gives an idea to how crafted the Inkas were. Even more then Machu Picchu, The giants stones are just breath",
          "For anyone looking for a breathtaking site that balances the amazing level of preservation at Machu Picchu, I cannot recommend this strongly enough. It is in walking distance from Cusco, dramatic in scale, still quite impressive and beautiful, but has the clear markings of",
          "The site is very accessible, easy to walk and there is a lot to see. However, there are not a lot of signs on site and having a guide with us was supremely helpful at understanding what we were looking at and where we were on the site.",
          "One of the issues is that it is difficult to imagine this place with people running around. There is little sign posting to highlight the attraction.",
          "Hi above Cusco, this is a great introduction to Inca architecture and engineering. Be sure to read up on the history of the Spanish conquest before you come.",
          "The ruin is huge but most of them were destroyed. If you do not have a tour guide, I do not recommend you to come over. I had a tour guide and he told us historical background of the place. It's not crowded, I bought a Combo entry tickets to get in. I think better save your",

          "Cool site to visit: it is Beautiful and take some foto\u2019s from the distance. Really likes it and of course the history. View from the Christ status is cool and I recommend to walk down via the stairs. You Will Be in the Centre very quick; Nice, Good excersize and safes budget!",
          "The history, the scenery, the unbelieveable scale of this temple site is a must see. I would suggest a guided tour or very complete guide to better understand the complexity of this attraction.",
          "The name probably lingers on but it is a best site around Cusco. Make sure you have plenty of time here and make your way to the Mirador/viewpoint.",
          "Size: This is a must see if you are in Cusco\u2014so near the city but completely unique in its purpose. It\u2019s built on some pre-Incan ruins (which typically means it became part of the Incan Empire but was built before that time...this site is no exception), but it is SO much",
          "What is the mystery of building from such a perfect block of stones? You cannot squeeze a piece of paper between them. And if you realize that it was done without heavy machinery it becomes even more amazing. Definitely worth visiting!",
          "The history seen within these ruins is incomparable. If you are making the trip to Cusco I would highly recommend taking the time to visit these ruins. The hike up from town is pretty rough, so taking a cab is worth it. The elevation is fairly high, so bring some coca leaves if",
          "An incredible Inca\u2019s site. This is one of the most interesting Inca\u2019s place to visit and admire the wonderful constructions this incredible civilization build.",
          "We took the boleto turistico circuito 1 for s/70 and visited all the ruins, starting far away from Cusco and finishing in Sacsayhuaman. The site itself is impressing because of its sheer size and the fantastically crafted Inca stone walls. Other than that, there is not much to",
          "Site of a battle between the Spanish and Incas. Only about 20% of its original size remains. Depends on what sequence you visit. After Machu Picchu, nothing quite matches. This is different. Not like other sites but because of it's size we couldn't get a feel for it. Maybe we",
          "This was one of our favorite places in Peru. Make sure you walk around the back to the \"slides\" on the rock surface. Our guide knew to take us there, but I heard from many others that they had no idea they were even there.",
          "Very beautiful ruins, really close to the center of Cusco. It could be called the \"near little brother\" of Machu Picchu. From the top you can appreciate also an amazing view of the city.",

          "The ruins of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n are impressive and worth a visit. We walked up from the city, which is doable, but quite strenuous. In order to visit the ruins, a boleto turistico is required. We had to go for the full ticket because we are also visiting Moray. Even with one child for",
          "Interesting but nothing if you have seen Machu Picchu. You only need about 30 min to see this site. However is central to most day tours of Cusco",

          "Made all the better by our incredibly enthusiastic and engaging tour guide, Joel! We travelled through Llama Travel and could not recommend the guide enough. We were left to wander around after the initial talk for around 20 minutes and it really was very helpful and",
          "If you are looking for something to do away from Cusco, but near as well, then these ruins are worth going to. It's right outside of Cusco, you get a great view of the nature surrounding Cusco, and the ruins are impressive as well as the view of the city.",

          "We hiked up to the gate to learn that tickets were almost $30 US! They don't take credit cards either and we didn't have that cash on hand, but was a little too steep for the quick visit we were looking for anyway so we passed on buying entry. There are guys at the gate",
          "Enjoyed the visit to this magnificent place, beautiful and impressive. A site you should visit in Cusco...",

          "This is an very interesting place to visit. It's a large site, great to walk around, interesting to learn about and also beautiful views across the city of Cusco and the mountains beyond. You can visit here as part of a tour group or if you arrive yourself, there are guides here",
          "Wow, i was amazed on arriving to Sacsayhuaman, the site is full off history and mystery from the ancient civilisation, absolutely huge stone blocks which have many sides and edges which fit perfectly, you will ask yourself how they build this site?? a must visit, take a tour",
          "Great place to visit if you're in Cusco as only a short distance from centre. We walked but if you have you children, or don't fancy a long walk up hill, consider a taxi",
          "On the road From Cusco airport to our beautiful hotel my spouse and I visited Sacsayhuaman It was our first Incas ruin that we Visited on our first trip to South America. We very very impressed by Architecture differences from what we are used in Europe. And loved it. Next",
          "We visited this place as part of the Cusco City tour. The place has so much history and beauty just like all the other ruins. Fascinating to see the huge square boulders used to build the place. It was interesting to hear the history, notably how the Incas fought the Spaniards",

          "If you're looking to learn a little about the oldest incas then this is a good place to start! While arguably not as magnificent as Machu Picchu, it's a great view of cusco, and would recommend hiring a guide to explain the ruins and gain some depth. The incline is steep if",
          "Another Inca ruin site that you have to see in Cusco. You have to marvel at how The Inca could move boulders over 100 pounds here.",

          "The monument it self is above Cusco. Fiets of all you can walk for the centre in about half an hour. A steep walk, but wort while. Otherwise by bus of taxi. The monumental site has to be discovered in about one and a half hour. From the top you have a splendid view over Cusco.",
          "As everyone has written, this place is great to visit. The only down side is they sell you a one day pass for 4 locations, and it is a lot of work to go to all 4 in the same day. I highly recommend walking around Sacsayhuaman to see ancient Inca Ruins, and then walking over",
          "The site has wide open spaces with a vastness to take you into the world of the Inca. See the puma outlay of the city of Cusco as it will be referenced should you visit other Inca sites while in Peru. It's a great place to start your historical visits in Peru. Rich in lots of",

          "We took a cab up to Sacsayhuaman for about 30 Soles, we had the full passes that got us into several attractions around Cusco, totally worth it. Sacsayhuaman was a large area, great view from the top of Cusco. There were some Alpaca's and Llama's wandering around too.",
          "A good way to acclimatise to walking around in high altitude. Although it is accessible by car/taxi. There are day tickets and weekly tickets available which allow entry into multiple locations and historical sites around the city.",

          "Very nice visit... totally recommend to take it guided (in my case it lasted 3 hours for 17 dollars). If not guided you\u2019ll just see some rocks.",
          "The local bus from the Mulino Bus Terminal costs 1 Sol. Between the 4 Main attractions you can also use the bus for 1 Sol per leg. Very impressible.",
          "Sacsayhuaman is a huge Inka site, so give yourself plenty of time for it. As with most historical places in Peru, there are pretty much no informational signs, so doing a self guided tour is very difficult. We did do it on our own and had a lot of fun exploring it, but if you're",
          "My husband and I booked through Peru For Less and our guide for the city tour was Fabricio who took us here. We were so lucky as he dropped us all the way to the top and we worked our way down when most of the other tours started at the bottom and worked their way up. Fabricio",
          "Second to Machu Picchu, this is the most famous set of Incan ruins. How do I know this, we had a local guide come and explain the details and significance of Sacsayhuaman. Also, go in the mornings, way less crowded.",
          "The third part of the Inti Raymi was here. Beautiful esplanade with giant rocks. All I can think of is how the incas moved this rocks and what an amazing energy you can feel.",
          "We toured the outside due to a shortage of time. We found a guide who told us about the structure and it was fascinating. It is below the big cross. Our guide drove us up there too and back to our hotel all for $40 for our family",
          "Would recommend you take a taxi to the entrance, which should not cost more than 10 Soles, if you are willing to negoitate. If you will be visiting the Sacred Valley buying the combination ticket for both Cusco and the Valley will save you 10 Soles. You can only buy the",
          "I visited the site along with my tour group. I loved how the Incas used their brains to construct walls and other structures. I also love how flat the ground is where their plazas were located.",
          "This broad open field had llamas grazing beside an enormous wall of stone, on which no cement was needed or used. Hard not to wonder why the Spanish colonizers did not learn more from the Incas. Also furnished a beautiful view of Cusco from over 13000ft. Breathtaking in several",
          "You can walk here in about an hour or take a 10 minute cab ride. Really incredible work of the Incas! The massive rocks are cut and place with such precision that one can't even slip a piece of paper in between stones! There will be tons of people there, but it's a big area!",
          "You shouldn't miss this site if you go to Peru - it was amazing - the size of these rocks and the almost impossible way this was constructed literally boggles the mind",
          "This inca site is right at the edge of the city.you could just hop in a taxi and be there in minutes. We went with tour group.but i think this is a site that is worth doing on ypur own it is so expansive. That a tour service just doesnt hv the schedule for a really good look",
          "I would highly recommend seeing this location. You are able to get pretty close to the architecture and see stone work that went into building Sacsayhuaman.",
          "Hi I went here with some friends, it was different from a few years ago they limited the amount of places you could go. I did find a new path I didn't see last time that brings you to this great lookout under a cross. They have a lot of nice walls to see and photo opportunities.",
          "A very important ancient site. I recommend that you take a guided tour as your guide can explain the excavations and the importance of the site. Very impressive.",
          "The incan ruins are amazing--they built huge walls and terraces with just human power. The ruins are fascinating.",
          "The site is a lot bigger that I imagined it. The rock-on-rock construction definitely impressed me. And make sure you slide down the rock slides on the back side of Sacsayhuaman.",
          "As others have written, you should take a taxi up to the site because it is a rugged, lengthy ascent. Our taxi driver agreed to return to pick us up after two hours and that worked out perfectly (40 soles roundtrip for six people) but many taxis seemed available up there. f you",
          "Very interesting Inca site with views of all of cusco and the surrounding mountains. You can take a taxi from around 10 soles from the plaza de armas or walk. I recommend the taxi as the walking route is very steep and follows the road with no sidewalk. There are guides",
          "Visiting during Inti Raymi Festival was one of the highlights of my life! The ruins are fascinating and during the Winter Solstice, the whole area comes alive with dancers and a traditional ceremony honoring the New Year and the Father Sun.",
          "If you read the Last Days of the Incas you need to go here! This is such a significant historical site. The rocks are huge and impressive. The view from the top of the whole city/valley are spectacular. We spent about 1 hour 30 minutes on site. I was in awe the whole time. Do",
          "These ruins, situated above Cusco, are interesting and make for a good hike up the hill if you need some exercise. The combination ticket is expensive, but we enjoyed visiting the other ruins on subsequent days. Don\u2019t bother with the museums on the ticket. We visited 2 and they",
          "A historical place that shows you Inca architecture and stone mason skills that these guys had. Worth a visit when in Cusco.",
          "We visited this site at the end of the day on a Cusco City Tour with friends. Guides provided information about the history and significance of the the location.",
          "This is my second time to Sacsay and I could do it again. Amazing place to ponder what happened many years ago.",
          "Allow plenty of time to wander around here. It is hard to believe that such enormous stones were moved by humans! An amazing place to visit which gives more of an insight into the Inca history.",
          "Not far out of Cusco, but high above it, this place is another Incan eye opener. The vastness is extraordinary, along with the huge boulders placed into massive walls. How they managed it is another story. One very good thing - especially when you\u2019re at altitude and every step",
          "One of the most important Incan ruins. It gives you perspective on the monumental task the laborers had in constructing such sites.",
          "interesting visit and stunning to see the structures their construction and size especially when you consider when built the history and how everything was assembled",
          "Sacsayhuaman is very close to Cusco. We visited it after Tambomachay, Puka Pukara & Q'enco. What an amazing morning!! The stones are huge, you really figure out the importance of the place for the Incas. Loved it and ... you can walk to Cusco and arrive directly at the plaza de",
          "Great ruins to walk around. We only stayed about 30 mins which was enough for us. We walked 3/4 up and then a driver offered to drive to other ruins for 20 sols then back to our hotel which was great value for us.",
          "Remarkable site! It has paths for strolling and the view of the city below should not be missed. The stone walls are unbelievable.",
          "This was top of our \"to do list\". We booked a hotel within walking distance of the site. It was a struggle to hike up, 70 soles per person - well worth it. Stone masonry at its best. You will find similarities in Machu Picchu, it's just oversized. Mind boggling skills of",
          "At first I was truly misled by my wife by pronunciation of \"Sexy Woman\" since I didn't do my homework. We wondered around a little bit before we realized that we needed a guide to tell us the stories of these beautiful stones. There are many local guides for hire at the gate",
          "You arrive here and the sheer size of the structures is shocking. Then you learn that none of the stone used was located on site- it all needed to be transported there. And they didn\u2019t have the wheel. And they didn\u2019t have advanced tools for cutting the stone. Yet each piece fits",
          "Our tour had an excursion to Sacsayhuaman with is located about 1 hour from our hotel. After having seen pictures of the site for years it was good to see the amazing stone work close up",
          "These aren't the best Incan ruins to see. There are a ton of them, and this one wasn't amazing. We also didn't have a great tour guide which could be part of it. We walked around, walked through a tunnel (old aqueduct), and walked around the temple. Super crowded. The view",
          "Sacsayhuaman is a great example if the ingenuity of the Inca stance carvers. Imagine stones weighting 100+ tons carved to fit each other close enough that you cannot fit a pice of paper! With all due respect to the precision of Lego pieces.... Wow! ...If you're in/near Cusco,",
          "It's so sad the Spanish dismantled this incredible creation, but what's left is still pretty astonishing. It boggles the mind that the Incas were able to build something of this quality and magnitude 600 years ago.",
          "Really interesting spot which was brought to life with our World Expeditions guide. She had great knowledge but was most interested in answering our questions and finding out what interested us. Not far from town and on the way back there are great views of Cusco.",
          "Incredible location & experience visiting this site. Mind boggling & outstanding to see the size of these massive stones fitted so perfectly that it seriously blows your mind! Well worth the $70 Sole to gain access to this area & definitely visit The Temple of the Moon slightly",
          "Sacsayhuaman was not far away from Cusco historic centre and it took 20 mins from our hotel at San Blas, Cusco to reach by car. In the car . It was an immortal creation made by Inka King Pachakuek in the fifteenth century on the top of the twelve thousand feet mountain. On 3000",
          "Amazing to see what the Incas made almost 1000 years ago. Just remember to walk slow and take your time to walk around to avoid High altitude sickness",
          "Been several times at this site, this is my favorite ruin around Cusco. Take your time, visit the whole ruin, don\u2019t miss the natural rock slides in the ruins. Bear in mind that what you see is only the rocks the Spaniards couldn\u2019t move down to Cusco to build churches, that\u2019s",
          "This is a very impressive Inca site with a lot of history. Our guide was very knowledgeable and we learned a lot.",
          "As part of our trip, we visited this important place in Incan history. Our guide from Crossing Andes Travel gave us the history of the location. Beautiful area",
          "This area is filled with interesting ruins and history, and it's 100% worth a visit. The structures themselves are beautifully assembled and maintained, and the joints in particular are pure and tight. We walked up from Plaza de Armas, and that was both fun and a bit",
          "Unbelievable!!The Inca people were clever and very strong!! We had a brilliant guide Fabricio from Peruforless.He made us feel welcome and part of his heartfelt history of Cusco. Cusco is such a happy place,in spite if all the sadness!",
          "Great place to start your cuzco tour. no matter if you think that the stones were place by inca architects or by aliens is still a unique construction.",
          "we went to this place in our city tour it was fastastic!! is a ceremonial place many big stones we enyojed in this place.",
          "It really is hard to understand how they managed to create something so magnificent, we went with a tour that explained the history of this place. It is really impressive what they could achieve at that time with such precarious technologies, we are talking about civilizations",
          "A gorgeous, historic place. Regrettably they were putting up stands for the Sun Festival when we visited, which was a bit disturbing.",
          "First stop of the city tour in Cusco. This is the location that hosts inti raymi celebration on June 24th. The history of this place is overwhelming. The structure built by the Incas is outstanding and the remaining elements are a true testament of their talent.",
          "This inca fortress is magnificent. Our tour guide shared with us some incredible stories that made this tour very memorable.",
          "Great walk around these ruins, guide was excellent and well versed in interesting stories. We went on the celebration of the cross day, heard lots of fire works!",
          "Huge stone ruins which has some recent restoration on the top of mountain where a great view of Cusco in Valley. Loved it",
          "The history and the engineering behind this archaeological sight is quite extradinary! If your in Cusco one must see the place where the Incas fought the Spaniards for the last time before they escaped into the few escaped into the mountains !",
          "This used to be a temple for sun and lightning. We walked up here which was really tough but you get to see the small streets and local places. Taxis are available. We got a guide for 60 soles. It was worth it to understand the history. The tunnel was a bit scary. But the star",
          "Big, impressive with fabulous views over Cusco but the intimacy of other sites make this a bit disappointing, it is a very large spread out site, we found it difficult to understand the area and the reason for it being built. Maybe be we had a poor condor travel rep, maybe it",
          "Engineering enthusiasts will marvel about how this was created! Easy to do with the other archaeological sites in the area and definitely worth seeing.",
          "A site in walking distance from Plaza de Armas in Cusco. What most people forget on their visit here, is that there are 3 more sites situated higher up. You can either walk here or take the bus for 1 sol. Buying the entrance ticket to saqsayhuaman (70 soles) you can instead buy",
          "It's just amazing to visit these Incan ruins. It's amazing to see the engineering that was involved in building this site and many of the other ruins. I would definitely recommend going!",
          "The price of admission was high but it truly is amazing to see the craftsmanship and engineering that went into this construction. Some of the reviews said to take a taxi up and walk down. I walked up to the top entrance, through the site and exited the lower entrance. Is it",
          "I am amazed by the workmanship given the tools they had to work with. For the most important historical locations they did not use grout between the blocks and the structures have survived at least two major earthquakes.",
          "Among the many sites I planned to visit, I had not come across this one in advance. It is spectacular.",
          "We took a little trek from Cusco centre to these ruins. It was amazing. One of the most underrated object which most people just skip. Most recommended.",
          "Really good way to spend a day in Cusco. It's an amazing site and easy to get to. The area around the site is impressive as well.",
          "The site is another illustration of the Incas ability to build with huge stones, some the size of buses. It defies my imagination on how they moved these huge heavy rocks. The area is really exposed as you walk round somewhere of the sun here. To get the full concept of the site",
          "Fabulous views of Cusco and an extraordinary look into the Incan civilization. A guide may improve the experience although if some study and other locations have been visited, you go do it yourself.",
          "Sacsayhuaman is located in the eye of the puma-shaped city design and is where the festivals are held. It has beautiful ruins that are small but easy to explore and is easily accessible by 10 minute taxi ride to/from the city center. Highly recommend as a first stop to start"

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "The Bean to bar workshop was amazing! We had great fun and the tutor had great knowledge and was very passionate. I would recommend this workshop! My child joined me towards the end and had fun with moulding",
          "It has collection of chocolate and coco beans . Some gift items and tourist traps. Visit if you have nothing else to do.",
          "MUST VISIT This was such a fun and tasty experience! Alex was working there and introducing all the different flavours and types and explaining the process which is sooo interesting!! I tried and bought some of the best chocolate ever and because alex causes such a friendly",
          "Had a tour of the Chocolate Museo, and had the funniest tour guide explain the process of creating the yummy chocolate treats. After this we were treated to a sit down with a small bowl of warm chocolate, hot milk and yummy things to add when we created a scrumptious hot",
          "If you love chocolate this is a must see store. When you arrive they offer free tour of the making of chocolate plus sampling of all the different types of varieties of chocolate. Afterwords, there is infused Pisco tasting bar in which they will give you a taste of approximate",
          "Had a phenomenal time with the chocolate making class, well worth it. Learn how it starts all the way to the finishing touches and take home what you make!",
          "We had an afternoon left in Cusco and were looking for something a little relaxed to do after visiting the Inca ruinbs and before heading to the Sacred Valley the next day. This seemed a good option and it was close to our hotel. The chocolate making wasn't quite what we had",
          "I took the 2 hour chocolate making class and it was awesome! It was pretty much the only touristy thing I did while in Cusco so I had some reservations, but it was totally worth it. I learned a lot and Yil was not only super knowledgable, but kept us laughing for 2 hours.",
          "When we first saw the ChocoMuseo from the main square, it looked like just a small retail shop selling chocolate. After I signed up for the Chocolate making class ($25 USD/person), they showed me to another location, essentially in the same block and upstairs from the retail",
          "Had a lovely quick stop in here...chilli got chocolate and a willy wonker hot chocolate for me! Service was friendly and efficient, seating area is small, but was quiet when we went, so easily seated. Drinks were yum and was a good stop in. There was a cookery class just",
          "This course was interactive and fun. We learnt all about the growing, process and making of chocolate. We got to make chocolate with a choice of additives (nuts, fruit, etc), and were able to take it home. Aprons and head gear were supplied and photo taking was allowed",
          "I went to a chocolate making class here. Very informative, and there are some surprises (I won't give it away). Fun and delicious and you get to design your own candy! IF YOU HAVE TO TIME: GO!!",
          "This was even more than I expected, in a good way! Not only did we get to learn how to make our own chocolate, from roasting the beans to making the paste, but we also got to learn how to make traditional Myan chocolate and the Spanish/current hot chocolate. Our guide was",
          "If you have a question about chocolate, chances are Ivan knows the answer. In two hours, he taught us so much about the chocolate-making process. His workshop was much more interactive and fun than we imagined. He gave us great recommendations about what toppings \u2014 Cinnamon?",
          "At first I really thought this was a Museum, as it is what the name translates to... but it is a sort of \"interactive\" chocolate company. You can make your own chocolate there, you can taste so many different kinds of flavours and the products are really high quality. I did not",
          "Stopped in to buy some chocolate and ended up having one of the best hot chocolate experiences ever! I ordered one w/honey and chili. It was spicy and sweet w/ a huge ladle of dark chocolate in the bottom! Thank goodness it was at the end of my trip or I would have had one every",
          "A must visit for those chocolate lovers out there. The staff draw you in by the offer of free chocolate tastes outside. Head inside and check out the shop and buy yourself some chocolate covered nuts, fruits, marshmallows or a variety of chocolate flavours. At night, a hot",
          "Nice place to drink a good hot chocolate. Some informations on the production of chocolate are given: all the same, it's more a choco - restaurant than a museum.",
          "Our group of 6 took the bean to bar chocolate class. It was so much fun! Our chocolatier had a great sense of humor. He told us a lot about the origin of chocolate and about the plant itself. We roasted beans, peeled then and ground the into paste. We mixed the paste with milk",
          "This museum is so informative and made with so much thought. Great to spend some time in while in Cusco. You can try all their products which taste great. Manuel, one of the staff, showed us everything and was so lovely.",
          "Nothing outstanding. A rather fancy chocolate store (because of prices and hipster products) like many others you can find all over the world.",
          "My sister and I tried ourselves as chefs while staying in Cusco. It was so much fun to cook meanwhile discussing about culture and food in Peru. Our group (my sister, I and another couple) started off with making pisco sour. Then tried ourself on a corn soup, an Aj\u00ed de Gallina",
          "Beautiful location. The museum is located on the second floor of this little historic mini square where you can check out some llama wools, and other souvenir knick knacks. I made some delicious chocolate here with marshmallows. They had a HUGE array of options to place in",
          "Very interesting experience learning how to make chocolate. Took off a star because there's only dark chocolate (would have liked white or milk as well). They also teach you how to make a pisco sour which you can drink while making chocolate.",
          "cool place they show how coca is developed in to chocolate & give samples , don't try the spicy one it's not that good. it's 2 story so forget upstairs. very nice people, very informative",
          "Can't recommend taking a class here enough. It was mostly hands on, the teacher was very entertaining, and you get to try different chocolate drinks and make your own chocolate at the end.",
          "Ignore the title as it\u2019s a shop with a few demonstrations! Our three children not impressed, few samples and expensive products!",
          "Chocolate delicious Class fun for all ages Delicous hot chocolate & brownies Awesome handcream Free samples Lots of chooses Very good milk and dark chocolate",
          "If you\u2019re interested in learning about the history of chocolate and some of the processes to make chocolate from cocoa beans, then this is the place for you. They also have some free samples of various strength chocolate, as well as liqueurs, which are all available to buy from",
          "Made chocolate with kids. Fun class to make chocolates. Learned the history and how it\u2019s made. Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time. Class size is limited.",
          "Went with the family to learn about chocolate. Really hands on, fun, and delicious. Please note you need to return 45 minutes after class to pick up your finished chocolates.",
          "A mildly interesting museum visit. Some demonstrations of the life cycle of cacao and chocolate provide a basic understanding of the chocolate making process",
          "Great little chocolate workshop for 45mins - 1hr. We started with choosing between dark & milk chocolate to put into mounds of our choice along with a variety of additional things like gummy bears and M&S\u2019s, coconut, coffee beans etc. And then a tour into how chocolate is made",
          "Yesterday was incredible, with our first day in Cusco we visited the city and had our chocolate workshop in the afternoon. The group of 9 was not too small and not too big and the team that was with us spoke perfect English. We still have part of our chocolate we did, a nice",
          "An expensive chocolate shop with all things chocolate similar to shops in cities around the world. Nothing special.",
          "Our tour guide had arranged a visit to the Choco Museo for us, we had a very nice young man explain the history of chocolate to us followed by a tasting session, very informative. We were then treated to a cup of hot chocolate to drink. there is a nice cafe and of course lots of",
          "Very nice selection of chocolates from white to dark and everything in between, including drinks such as choco tea. Each city has a ChocoMuseo though so be aware that this is a store, not a \"museum\" as we initially thought. Still certainly worth a visit. I love the",
          "This is a very nice and well-laid-out museum. It is much smaller than the Larco Museum in Lima, and, unlike Larco, this collection only goes back as far as Cusco's origins, maybe 2,000 years ago (unlike Larco, which, covering all of Peru, has artifacts going back 5,000 years).",
          "The good: Once it got started, we had an excellent 2 hour bean to bar workshop. It was great to be able to see, touch and taste the bean from every stage once it was dried to tempered. The bad: Via the web, we booked a 2 hour bean to bar workshop at the Plaza Regocijo months",
          "If you love chocolate this place is for you. Lots of free samples, a cafe selling delicious food- can recommend the crepes with banana and strawberry! Sit looking out over the Square from the balcony on a hot day. Take a cooking class or taste their pisco\u2019s.",
          "I had a lunch after returning from the Amazon at the cafe above the museum. Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Cusco. There was a lot of hipster vibe in the place and they took their coffee and hot chocolate (an absolute must) very seriously. The food was deli style,",
          "Really fun way to learn about how chocolate is made! Fun activity for everyone - couples, families, singles!",
          "We were looking for something fun and relaxing to do on our last day in Cusco and found the chocolate making class. It was a great last day activity after being go go go for the days prior. They take you through the whole process of making chocolates from harvesting the beans",
          "This visit was a highlight of our trip. A great activity for kids and adults alike. Great presentation for the 2 hour class.",
          "The class is very funny and informative. You don\u2019t see time pass by as you learn and experience chocolate making from bean selection to taste your creation! The host is very entertaining and does a good job to make this interactive. A great time!",
          "This was a fantastic way to spend our first day in Cuzco. Jose, who led our tour, was a super nice guy, and he included everybody in the fun. Our group of about 12 included kids as young as nine, and everybody had a great time. Starting with raw cocoa beans, we roasted them,",
          "This place offers a great 2 hour class on chocolate making, which is not only informative but very tasty. The displays had huge pictures and lots of information, self guided is easy. After doing that, we sat on the balcony overlooking a small park and people watched. View and",
          "Everything you ever wanted to know about chocolate is displayed. They also teach you how to make it! The hot chocolate is wonderful, the real stuff, not the powdered whatever it is we get at home. They also sell lots of chocolates, so you can bring gifts for everyone at home.",
          "Super fun activity--learning and participating in how chocolate is made from the cocoa bean and then making our own chocolates. The instructors do a really nice job keeping the class entertaining and interesting. We were lucky enough to have just our family at this particular",
          "This is a small museum, but had some different samples of drinkable chocolate and some chocolate liquors. There are some cooking classes you can take as well, and a small cafe with coffee, hot chocolate, crepes, and other offerings. It's worth visiting if you have a little free",
          "We loved the Chocolate Tour and making our own chocolates! We learned a ton from our tour guide. (We did the mini-tour in English)",
          "The Bean to Bar Workshop was the highlight of my son's trip to Peru! We learned so much about how chocolate is made and we got to sample so many different things as well as make our own chocolates!!",
          "Stopped in here before trek to Machu Picchu. We were welcomed with a sample of hot chocolate, which was delicious. We bought some chocolate bars to enjoy over the week. After the hike, we came back to Cusco and had some time to kill. We decided to take the chocolate making",
          "Had a hot chocolate and brownie as part of a deal and it was delicious! So chocolatey and so good Also did the dinner cooking class - amazing time! Made pisco sours, ceviche, lomo salteado and had chocolate fondue for dessert. Really worth the cost and would completely recommend",
          "If you want a GOOD cup of hot chocolate, go to the Chocolate Museum. We found it one of the best in Peru and we sampled a lot of hot chocolates!",
          "With 1 day off in Cusco, we discovered the city in the morning and evening while we went to the chocolate workshop in the afternoon. Our prof was very funny and the chocoloate was from bitter to sweet. I didn't know that Peru is one of the main producers of Kakao, but I got some",
          "This was a great way to learn about the the environmental, cultural and culinary history of Peru and the Incas. The two hour cooking workshop is fun and educational - especially for big groups with a wide range of ages. And the staff/instructors are super engaged and informed.",
          "The workshop was very informative and fun, the chocolates we made and took home were also delicious!",
          "Quaint little place, we had some samples to try to compare the different chocolate, the assistant was lovely, helpful and not pushy. The chocolate was expensive to buy, but difficult to resist when you have tested and tried and found your favourite!",
          "Had lunch in the cafe before our class. Crepes were excellent. Got a good lesson on how chocolate is made. Made several different chocolate drinks. Then able to pick out our tray and what kind of chocolate to make bars with several different add-ons. Wait 45 minutes and then can",
          "We had a group visit to the Choco Museo. We learned about the different cocoa and types of chocolate. After the talk we were treated to a hot chocolate. It was fantastic!",
          "If you're not streamlining coca leaves, you probably want to take it easy the first day in Cusco. The ChocoMuseo is perfect for that! I recommend the tour as they take you through the whole process (50 seeds to a cocoa fruit) with various tactile activities to keep you engaged.",
          "We enjoyed the two hour chocolate making workshop. We started with dried cacao bean and went through all the steps to make two different kinds of hot chocolate. Next we were given melted chocolate and a crazy number of toppings for you to combine into the moulds provided. This",
          "Definitely worth a visit to the chocolate shop come quaint museum. The little cafe has a couple of small balconies to chill out on and take in the sights of the town.",
          "The staff are lovely in here and offer tasters as per all their stores. They weren\u2019t pushy and that actually encouraged us to buy some souvenirs.",
          "Very interesting museum. I highly recommend it. you learn so much about the Inca culture. It was really quaint and interesting.",
          "We did the chocolate workshop on our last day in Cusco. Our group of 4 adults and 3 teenagers for the US were joined by adults from Australia, the UK, South Africa, and Norway. It was a good fun group. The competitive nature of the roasting process and grinding was fun. The",
          "We knew of the ChocoMuseo in Lima but I wasn\u2019t aware that there was one in Cusco. We stopped in after a late lunch at Chicha and took the tour and did the tasting. It was an interesting diversion and if we had planned better we might have considered doing one of the chocolate",
          "Great retail store(s) giving samples of many chocolate based products and then selling you the full portions...candy, drinks, T-Shirts, worth a stop if convenient but there is nothing historic or Peruvian...just everything chocolate.",
          "I love a hot cuppa chocolate and the best I have had was at Ore - Ducasse au ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. This was a close second only rivaled by Lindt in Toronto :)",
          "Fantastic little shop just down from the 12-sided stone. We did the 2 hour chocolate making class and were lucky enough that is was just our party of 5. (Strolling by, other classes were much more full). You learn - hands-on - the entire chocolate making process that ends with",
          "Lovely little spot, and fantastic staff who love chocolate, and filling you full of it. Even if you don't have the time to enjoy one of their Chocolate Making Classes, ask Jeremy to give you the low down on the whole chocolate process while sipping on some cocoa tea while",
          "Definitely recommend purchasing the 2 hour chocolate making class. Within the $25 per person price, you create your own chocolates and taste various chocolate drinks that you help create, and you receive information about how chocolate is created. Would visit again!",
          "You will receive a nice presentation on the production and processing of chocolate in English if you wish. Very well organized. I came as part of an Intrepid Tour group. The visit ended with complimentary hot chocolate. Lots of items to buy to remember you visit to Peru and the",
          "A funny group, good chef, and a lot of chocolate to eat. On our first day in Cusco we came here after discovering the city itself. The workshop took 2 hours and the participants were of every kind of age. We didn't know that Peru is one of the largest cacao producers in the",
          "My sons (age 10 and 8) swear this is the coolest thing they\u2019ve done on our trip. Even better than Macchu Picchu and Sacred Valley. If you have kids (or even if you don\u2019t and want to learn how to make chocalate), this is a great activity to do while in Cusco. The history of",
          "We visited here as part of a tour. We had the opportunity to see how chocolate was made and also to sample the chocolate and to try many of the liquers which are available. Fun visit.",
          "Did this with couples and it was a real treat. It\u2019s a great way to rest your feet for 2 hours making chocolate. They also give you 10% off at the cafe, which makes cheap and delicious food even cheaper. This was a lot of fun, and nice to learn about the cocoa culture. Even",
          "Our families had a great time learning about chocolate and making our own chocolate to take home. The chef was fun to work with and speaks English very well.",
          "As we travel we like to do hands on activities. This will go down as one of the most fun. We did learn interesting facts about chocolate, but the fun really began when we started to make the hot chocolate and chocolate treats. Such a fun ( and yummy) way to spend a couple of",
          "This place is great!! We did the bean to bar class and were lucky enough to have it to ourselves. It was the best money we spent. We got to taste the beans themselves and learnt a few things about local beans and how and where they grow. We then went through the process of",
          "Although the 'bean to bar' class was fun, the chocolate we made didn't last long before becoming grainy and not-so-tasty. We wanted to take the truffle class instead, but were informed rather snootily that it was not available and most people did bean to bar. While attempting to",
          "We stopped by for a hot chocolate and ended up getting the full chocolate presentation. The young man who did the demo was very friendly and fun to listen to. Obviously the presentation is basically an extended sales pitch to get you to buy chocolate, but it was still fun. To",
          "Great class on how chocolate is made. You make the best hot chocolate you\u2019ve ever had, from scratch, and your own chocolate candies that you customize with a variety of flavors. The only flavor missing was bacon. Highly recommended.",
          "Definitely worth a visit solely for the hot chocolates. This was simply the best hot chocolate I\u2019ve had, there was a choice of 3 flavourings - the perfect size. You can also take a tour of how the chocolate is made with lots of taste testing of chocolate and liqueurs.",
          "They do a great job with the chocolate making class. I really did learn quite a bit about chocolate and they made it fun. You go through the steps of making chocolate, although the chocolate you end up using to make your take home pieces isn't from the beans that you crushed",
          "SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUUUUUN. Our guide in the museum was the funniest guy ever. (p.s they have chocolate flavoured condoms ;) )",
          "We went here with a couple of friends after hearing about it on our tour! Well worth the 2 hours and $25 USD. We had so much fun and learnt so much. Bonus was making our own chocolate to take home. It was fascinating to make a chocolate paste straight from the roasted bean.",
          "Worth a visit if you like chocolate as they explain how their chocolate is made. Gives you lots of things to try and taste - coca leaf chocolate, quinoa chocolate, hot chocolate (with cinnamon) etc. Pisco with chocolate and various flavours such ginger, mint etc.",
          "We happen to come across this place by accident when walking over to San Pedro market. The staff was great with the free tour given regarding how chocolate starts from bean to edible deliciousness. Through the tour, they provided samples of different chocolates grown from",
          "We took an evening cooking class at ChocoMuseo to learn to make pisco sours, corn chowder and local specialty, lomo saltado. What fun! Our chef, Katia, was lovely, talented and spoke perfect English. She took us to the San Pedro market to shop for fruits and veggies, and we got",
          "Great little tour and amazing chocolate! The crepes are also yummy. The location I went to was upstairs and had a great view",
          "If you like chocolate then this is the place to go. You get to hear the history of chocolate but more importantly you get to taste different chocolates. You can even taste different chocolate liqueurs or do classes in making chocolate things. The hot chocolate in the cafe there",
          "Learned a lot about the cocoa insistry and tried multiple forms- dark, milk, white, chili, coca leaf, chocolate digestifs and chocolate infused jams. Decent cafe, great atmosphere, knowledgable staff.",
          "My husband and I did a cooking class here with Esther and Gladys. We shopped for fresh ingredients at the outdoor markets first. Back at the kitchen we made arroz con pollo and papas al huancaina. Excellent! They also taught us how to make a pisco sour. For dessert we had",
          "Took the Bean to Bar class to learn how chocolate is processed and ended with making our own chocolates to take with us. 2 hour class with loads of info and really good chocolate!",
          "Very welcoming..try hot chocolate with honey and chilli.sit on the balcony. Watch the world go bye...",
          "Went in as we were going past. It is quite small, very commercial and not really a museum, more a retail outlet. Only do if have nothing else planned.",
          "The staff provided a good presentation on the history of chocolate production, methodology, and where and how chocolate is produced and consumed in the world. It doesn't take long and is well worth the time.",
          "Great little museum and a fabulous hot chocolate at the end. Highly recommend the short tour. Learned a lot about chocolate and flavors to add.",
          "Ultimately this museum is there to encourage you to buy all kinds of chocolate products at the end of the tour. Having said that the tour was fun and interactive. Great samples and helped me gain a broader knowledge of how chocolate is collected and processed",
          "We had an absolute blast at ChocoMuseo. Not only did we learn a ton about chocolate making, we had a history lesson, quite a few laughs, some botany education, and treats for the plane!",
          "Im at home eating my chocolate as I speak. The class was fun and engaging. Our instructor was knowledgeable and kept things moving.",
          "Its marketed as a museum, but its really just a chocolate shop. There are some tasters of chocolate though and occasionally, seemingly just when they feel like it, the staff will race you through the 2 rooms and briefly explain what its about. Perhaps if you do a bean or",
          "Even my friend liked it. I say this as he was very sceptical about the workshop but it was so much fun this morning! Unfortunately nothing of our handmade chocolate survived, but I can highly recommend this course. Julia was very friendly and attentive during the entire time,",
          "So much fun to attend the bean to bar workshop with my 13 year old son. We both had a wonderful time. The instructors were awesome and funny. A great time was had by all! Plus who doesn\u2019t love taking home bier own chocolate!",
          "We did this activity with our 2 kids, and we all had a blast! It was so much fun to make your own chocolates and be able to take them home with you. As the chocolates are cooling, the instructor gives you a lesson on the history of chocolate and how it is made. The workshop is a",
          "Sweet little museum, we went twice- the free tour is informative and short, my 20 year old and I enjoyed it and learned, we then enjoyed a good hot chocolate and mousse at the cafe. The following day we participated in the \u201cbean to bar\u201d workshop with the amazing Ivan and made",
          "Our host Iv\u00e1n was great and we learned a lot about chocolate in a 2-hour workshop. You get to use lots of fresh ingredients and do everything from the roasting of the cocoa beans. We paid about 79 soles each booking at the door on the day of the workshop, and I would say the",
          "We did the Bean to Bar two hour workshop in Cusco the day we arrived. We booked it that day online. It was the highlight of our time in Cusco for my 10 & 12 year old children. After a brief explanation of the history of chocolate and the cultivating process, we headed to the",
          "This was a fun place to learn about the chocolate in Peru. I had a great staff member who showed me all of the chocolates, liquors and even cosmetics made of chocolate. The only negative is that I felt like it was a little \u201ccommercial.\u201d",
          "A visit to the chocolate museum was included in my Intrepid tour of Cusco (as part of a longer exploration of Peru). The Chocolate Museum is just off the main square in Cusco (Plaza de Armas). We went at about 7:30 at night, so the staff were giving out lots more samples as it",
          "This is a small but free \"museo\" in which you can spend a short bit of time, perhaps on a rainy day. One of the staff members will greet you at the door, and in our case, seemingly run through the couple rooms as fast as humanly possible. Our guide quickly went over where cacao",
          "It is hard to find and does not look like a museum, but wait for the English tour of how they make chocolate. It is worth it. And then afterwards you get samples - delicious.",
          "Great little museum No pressure to buy and numerous chocolate morsels to taste Staff friendly but not pushy On the main square Made great gifts",
          "Very instructive mini tour where we get a good understanding of the key steps to producing chocolate and then tasting various formats and taste! Nice and good service!",

          "What a fun way to start our time in Cusco and ease into the high altitude. We had Yill as our instructor and laughed the entire time. Especially in the chocolate making class. Very informative and fun!",
          "My 10 year old says this is the best activity we did in Cusco. We molded chocolate lollipops and roasted cacao beans. It lasted only 1 hour, which was a perfect amount for our group. The longer 2 hour workshop may be better for adults.",
          "Great little stop into the choco museum. You can taste several types of chocolate and enjoy everything chocolate in the cafe upstairs. You can definitely do this place on a budget without the cooking the class and buying their products. Great experience.",
          "If you go here, be sure that you get Manu for a tour guide- he was hilarious. I don\u2019t think that I laughed harder at any time during my week visiting Peru! The chocolate and liquor tasting was fun too. ChocoMuseo was a little hard for us to find, but it\u2019s totally worth it!",
          "Looks really cool and they have nice products, but the chocolate itself is not that great. I tried their flavored piscos which I would highly recommend. Or just walk in and learn about the chocolate making process.",
          "I was walking past this place and decided to go in and kill sometime. When you go in they offer you a little educational piece on how chocolate is made and talk you through the whole process After that you continue the walk through the museum where you can try the different",
          "We really enjoyed going to the ChocoMuseo, the English speaking tour guide was really funny and taught us about the process of growing, harvesting and refining cocoa beans and making it into chocolate. You get to taste cocoa nibs, cocoa tea, chocolate sauce, five types of",
          "Super interesting. Great place to buy chocolate. Cafe had wonderful coffee and pastries. The short talk on how chocolate is made was very informative. Staff was very helpful. Take full advantage if the samples! Wish I had had time to take the chocolate making class.",
          "The shop is great but there is also a small museum, cafe and place where they give classes. I shopped, ate, learned about chocolate and took a class. Wll were wonderful.",
          "My sister and I are both chocolate lovers, so this was kind of a must for us in Cusco. We were not disappointed at all--either with the tour (which we didn't know we'd be taking) or with the products (that we sampled and purchased). A minute after we arrived, we were greeted",

          "What a fun way to start our first morning in Cusco!! Class started at 8:30 and we were promptly greeted. Class started with a nice history of how chocolate is made in the factories and then distributed to different countries! We then were given a chance to make chocolate tea",
          "This fairly small and simple museum offers a bit of background to chocolate, lots of chocolate themed items to buy and a caf\u00e9 serving a selection of hot chocolate drinks. Worth a short visit, interesting and the hot chocolate is delicious.",
          "We walked in early in the day and made our booking for later that day and spent the meantime exploring the city. When we arrived, there was such a large group signed up for the same time as our small party of 3 that we ended up with a private experience in a separate location",
          "We had so much fun doing the chocolate-making class! Our instructor was so nice and made the whole experience so fun. There is a lovely cafe here so even if you don't want to do the class, you still can come and hang out and enjoy delicious hot cocoa, cakes and sweets, etc.",
          "We had been to Cusco before and only had a day (arrived from Lake Titicaca via PeruRail) before we went to Lima so we decided to take the \"bean to bar\" workshop. It was alot of fun. Our \"teacher\" was funny and well-informed. We learned about how to harvest the cacao bean,",
          "After ducking into this small museum to hide from aggressive pan handlers, I was welcomed with a free cup of hot chocolate. This was delicious Peruvian cacao based goods here, and many samples to try. The workers were helpful without being pushy, which of course, made me want to",
          "I enjoyed the chocolate making class immensely. I had a few days free and randomly wandered into the top floor of the museum to learn more about the cocoa beans. While there, I did a chocolate making class that was one of my highlights in Cusco! I also bought Peruvian cocoa",

          "This was a fun, interactive and very educational experience. From the bean to the chocolate and Coco, we were entertained and involved. Very worth your while. You even get to take home your own custom blended chocolates. The staff are friendly and have great customer service.",
          "The Choco Museo is an expensive chocolate shop with rather average service in the heart of Cusco. This shop offers a variety of chocolate products, all of which are priced at a premium. While the bar I had was good, at 19 soles it should have included a ticket to Switzerland.",

          "They call it a museum in order to catch people like me, I guess, that love to learn something every day. But what it really is, is an ultra expensive chocolate store. They\u2019ve got a fake \u201cCacao Tree\u201d , that doesn\u2019t look to real, and some mapamundis showing you where this trees",
          "We had a really nice tour of the ChocoMuseo from Manu. He did it in spanish at our request so we could practice, and spoke slowly so we could understand. The museum is very interesting and offers generous free samples of amazing chocolate, chocolate jams, and piscos. Our",

          "The instructors were incredibly friendly and took us through the entire process of making chocolate. At the end we got to make our own chocolate, and we got 10% off everything in the store for taking this class. This is one of my favorite things to do in Cusco, it's a good thing",
          "Came here for the Bean to bar Work shop and was not disappointed. Our teacher Gladys was very friendly and told us all about how chocolate was made in the olden days. We then roasted beans stripped out the Coco and then proceeded to make our own chocolate pieces. This is a cool",

          "Excellent quality chocolate, very wide selection, and reasonable prices. The chocolate tea is amazing- I bought several bags after tasting a sample.",
          "They sell many types of chocolate and offer free samples, but it is a tiny little store and I expected a little bit more.",
          "I went to do the chocolate workshop on my own. The museum looks really good and stylish. It was funny, we did not only learn a lot about cacao and chocolate, the man who organised this workshop made us have such a good time! We sang, we made jokes and we lauged a lot. I would",
          "We went to the museum as part of an intrepid group tour. We had a great information session from a lovely young man and then enjoyed the most delicious hot chocolate. We came back by ourselves the next day to sit on the little verandah that overlooks the plaza and enjoy",

          "You can drop in just to sample the chocolates here, but it\u2019s worth also doing their free guided tour as it\u2019s really fascinating. And the chocolates from all over Peru are an experience. Chocolate tea, drinks, and more.",
          "On our last day in Cusco before heading back to Lima we were looking for something more relaxed as we did trekking tours (Machu Picchu y Rainbow Mountain) before. On the site of exploorperu we found the From Beans to Bar workshop and we decided to give it a try. Turned out to be",
          "We took a full Chocolate making lesson for 75 soles. It was one of the best experiences. I can finally make chocolate on my own and you take the ones you make with you. It took about 2 and half hours and you can share it with friends or strangers.",
          "My husband and I attended a chocolate making class here and learned SO much about how chocolate is grown, made, and packaged. After two hours we made our own chocolate creations. The class was a lot of fun, as the instructor was funny and engaging. A bit pricy but worth it!!",
          "We had a family trip to Peru. Agent arranged for this. We all enjoyed it-school age, teenagers, adults. Educational, hands on. A lot of fun really crushing the beans, making different drinks, and our own chocolate to take home.",

          "I initially stopped in here to kill some time but ended up really enjoying this place! It\u2019s a tight place (and ended up being very warm) but they keep tours moving throughout. We had a very lively guide who explained the process of making chocolate and gave us plenty of samples",

          "We decided to pop in here on a whim and had such a blast! The tours are free and our guide was hilarious! Informative about how chocolate is made, where it comes from- with the perks of taste testing too. There is also a cafe and shop where you can have a snack or buy souvenirs",
          "We visited just museum in October 2017 so these comments do not apply to the chocolate cooking classes that are also available. The museum tour is available in English and Spanish and takes you through how chocolate is grown, harvested, and made into a delicious dessert.",
          "This is a great thing to do in cusco! First you learn a little about the plant, then select your bean, roast them, make kakao paste if you can manage and create your own chocolate. It is really a fun ecperience. Just for the complainers - you use your own beans for chocolate",
          "Learn, taste, and make. We went through the entire process from selecting our beans, to roasting them, peeling, grinding, and making custom chocolates! What fun and a yummy takeaway.",
          "The one in Plaza de Armas has a few seats at the balcony, so you get to enjoy the view of the city. Their hot chocolate and fondue are good. Their (milk) chocolate mousse is ok, but it gets too sweet after a few bites, and the texture was a little too hard. Overall a great place",
          "If you want to find out more about the importance of the cocoa plant to the Incas and Peru in general, this little establishment is worth an hour of your time. Have a chew on some cocoa leaves or just sample a sweet before wandering around the exhibits. There are really that",
          "The workshop itself was very fun and informative. We had a great time and our \"guide\" spoke great English. The process of making chocolate was really fun. However, in the end, you mould your own chocolate and my turned out grey and not very good looking. And they specifically",
          "To be clear, it wasn't surprising that it was fun, it was surprising that it existed. We stopped in to the store first because it was next door to another shop we wanted to visit. We tried some cocoa tea and the shop worker mentioned that the museum was around the corner. We",

          "Stopped in the chocolate museum for a tour and some treats. The tour felt rushed and with lots of people in a small space it was loud and hard to hear the guide at times. Enjoyed the treats in the cafeteria. The brownie was the winner of all we tried.",

          "It was an excellent experience! Plus not only do you have the chocolate bars to take with you. They included a certificate which is a nice souvenir. However, best of all is they emailed a copy of the step-by-step process with photos included.",
          "I attended a chocolate workshop yesterday and had a great time learning about the Peruvian cocoa bean. The group was only seven people, so there was plenty of attention given to each person. The chocolate chef Gill really knows his stuff as he gave us a short history of how the",
          "It's not really a museum although it has a little information on the process to make the delectable treats. However it's worth it to buy some chocolate items. I recommend the chocolate covered orange peels and coco tea! Delicious. There are chocolate making activities children",

          "We visited this museum/cafe the day after completing a 4-day trek to Machu Picchu so were in the mood for comfort and leisure and this place fit the bill. We took the free guided tour, which was interesting and was provided by a funny and personable guy. We got to taste a number",

          "We only did a self guided tour which we found sufficient. You can taste some of their products which is nice, maybe not when the shop is filled to the brim with greedy touists. We had their chocolate fondue which was incredible. Make sure you pick the large one to share with",
          "A chocolate lovers heaven. We stat on the balcony overlooking the square and had European hot chocolates and chocolate brownies. The hot chocolates were to die for, the best hot chocolate I've ever had. We also had a chocolate brownie which was delicious too. Incredibly tasty",

          "The museum visit begins with a photo presentation provided with descriptions. In our case there was also a bilingual guide who talked us through and answered our questions. Our visit followed with chocolate and liquor tasting, both very tasty and interesting. Museum also offers",

          "We were waiting to go on the Inca trail and are wondering what we were going to do for two to three days. Sure, if you are like us you do the Sacred valley and you do the sights of Cusco, and they are well worth it, but you still have time to burn and are worried about trying",
          "We loved the ChocoMuseo. We had a free tour with a lovely lady whose English was great and we got to taste test bits of delicious chocolate and superb liquor. The museum caters for English language speakers too, with all of their information written in numerous different",
          "Went here with a big group and were given a tour of how chocolate is made. The information we were given was well presented and they spoke good English. There are quite a few visual aids to explain how the chocolate is made and the different stages. At the end, we were able to",
          "We found this in the guide book but we hadn't realised we could make chocolates too! The museum was ok but the fun started when we joined the class and made our own chocolates. Great fun!",
          "We did the bean to bar workshop and it was wonderful. The information that we were told and the activities of the class were great. The whole place is an awesome place to spend anywhere from 10 minutes to half a day. Our teacher Jill was awesome.",
          "great free mini tour through their little store/factory. they have a class you can do where you make chocolate but I just did the little tour. they explained how they make the chocolate and we were able to sample a variety of different chocolate products they make",
          "This was the highlight of my time in Cuzco. If you are a fan of chocolate, and are interested in the actual chocolate making process, definitely come to the Choco Museo! I think the name is what deceives people - it is not really a museum, more of a chocolate shop, chocolate",
          "The tour was fun and informative. The guide was funny and the chocolate in the adjacent cafe was very good.",
          "We went not really expecting to have a full tour but a little look at the shop... ended up with Oscar as our tour guide, and we had such a brilliant time! The tour was just the right amount of time, maybe just under an hour (including lots and LOTS of free samples! the best",
          "It's definitely more of a shop than a museum. I was quite disappointed. But you get to sample chocolate!",
          "The place was super crowded when we visited, but that's not the museum's fault. However, we received a lot of samples before we actually got a tour, and never actually got a tour - pretty disorganized. More of a chocolate shop than museum (you can learn everything in a tight 15",
          "They run through with you the way chocolate is made, and you get to do tastings of chocolate and various chocolate products. The guide of the mini tour given was humorous and funny and had us laughing throughout the presentation. Perfect thing to do when the weather outside is",
          "This place is very good for tasting chocolate. They give you history and tell you process of making chocolate. After you taste chocolate, alcohol chocolate and hot chocolate.",
          "Not sure what our expectations where, but all 5 of us, Including 3 late teen/early 20's kids thought this was brilliant. The humour and professionalism of the set up, and in particular Gille, who took our session was very insightful and hugely enjoyable. Great way to spend a",
          "We stopped in for the quick tour. We did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. Our guide was enthusiastic and informative. At the end of the short tour, we were able to sample and was informed about all fo the different products in the shop. Most of my souvenirs",
          "I guess I expected more from the workshop \"Bean to Bar\". The description said you would make chocolate all the way from roasting the beans to creating bars....and you do roast beans and create bars but you don't create the bars from the beans you roasted. While they explained",
          "We did the tour-hour chocolate making experience, led by the fun and knowledgeable Abel. We learned all about cacao production and got to make cacao husk tea, cacao nibs, and finished with chocolate candies with all sorts of fillings. Well worth the time and money!",
          "If you want to learn the process of making chocolate or want to venture to the Cocoa fields the ChocoMuseo is for you....also, the chocolates sold at the place are very good !"

          "While not as big and impressive as the Rio deJaneiro more famous cousin, it still quite interesting specially when lighted at night and if you go up to visit Sacsayaman Inca site, it is nearby and it offers great views to the city",
          "Near to \"sexy women\". in the field below, locals are cooking potatoes in clay make-shift ovens. They build them, start a fire, put in the potatoes and then break the oven down on the spuds. in 45 minutes it is lunch time.",
          "On top of a beautiful view, this statue of Christ has a particularly interesting history. I recommend taking a bus from Wanchaq, as it's a beautiful and bumpy ride! The location is convenient; it is right next to Sacsayhuaman.",
          "You can see the large lit up Christ from the square in Cusco looking over the city. Visiting it close up does not add anything, it looks better from the town.",
          "I don't know if I would drive here specifically to see this. There isn't much to do here but the views from here are pretty cool looking out over the city.",
          "Too many people too touristy and difficult to get a shot without wire fencing - go to Brazil to see This was ajrequested stop so great that we can add to city tour",
          "Ok, so it\u2019s not quite Rio, but it\u2019s still a nice place to head up to for views over the city, particularly if you\u2019re also coming to Sacsayhuaman",
          "This is a large Christ statue high up in the hills overlooking Cusco. You get great views from here. You'll find loitering locals in costume with LLamas who will let you take a photo of them for a tiny fee, so why not. Take your time walking up to the monument - you're at",
          "Not really very inspiring or monumental. Part of our Cusco City Tour which stopped at various ruins. Your aren't missing much if you don't see it.",
          "The statue and three crosses require a short climb. Expect encounter vendors selling trinkets and a mother with either small children or a llama wanting to charge you to take a picture. Overall, this si how they make thier living, so be kind end endulge them.",
          "We teally enjoyed visiting the white Christ statue. We learned about the history behind it and the view of the city down below is amazing! Definitely worth seeing!",
          "Our G Adventures guide brought us here and I'm so glad he did because I would have never known about this place and it was an amazing place to see Cusco from above. We stayed here for about 20 minutes and I got to take some of my favourite pictures from the trip. To be able to",
          "I had not included this in my trip. However, due to the problematic \" public transport \" option of the Animal Sanctuary, I ended up here. The statue itself, well, is average. Nothing special. The view of Cusco, is spectacular. If you are going to Sacsayhuaman in a private",
          "You do not have to go to the statue to see it. It can be seen and photographed with a good camera from Saqsawaman which is a to see site. The statue is impressive and is very close to the Saqsawaman site therefore you can go to it without spending a lot of time. Since you are",
          "Nice overview of city that helps orient you and give you the view of the plazas from the statue you see from the plazas!",
          "Good hike up steep road or steps to get ready for trail. We did this and Saksaywaman on same day to build up some lungs but felt both sites were nothing spectacular compared to other places to visit in region. Would not visit unless your not intending on going to other sites",
          "This attraction is very close to Saksaywaman. At the top, it offers best panoramic view of Cusco. The section to the top is not paved way. There was quite a lot of tourist during our time of visit",
          "There's no good excuse NOT to see this while you're in the area. Which you will be since Sacsayhuaman is right there. But definitely not worth an independent trip.",
          "Looks better at a distance. There's not a lot to this attraction. Giant statue of Jesus. This is however a spectacular viewpoint overlooking Cusco. Great spot for a panoramic picture of the city and the mountains behind.",
          "A cool little piece history, with a great view of the city. The monument sits on a promontory above the city, and there are often vendors selling tourist trinkets around, and the site can be reached by foot from the city (a pretty good 45 minute hike), or by taxi (a ten minute",
          "This statue sits high on a hill behind the Monasterio Hotel. Our guide told us it was a gift from non-Christian groups in the City of Cusco. It is much smaller than the Christ Statue in Rio but still beautiful.",
          "This is a must see while in Cusco. I would not recommend hiking to it. Easy to take a taxi. But make sure your taxi is round trip. Hard to find a taxi up there. The view of Cusco City is AWESOME!",
          "When you land in Cusco with that altitude buzz in your head, grab a few glasses of warm water with coca leaves and start walking slowly up the stairs to meet christ on the hill. The 6-8 km will test your cardiopulmonary fitness and get you prepared for your expedition!",
          "While this is a notable statue of the Cusco area, it seems less impressive up close than from a distance. I would say that, if you are taking a ride on the Panoramic Tourist Bus, as we did, and you visit this statue as one of the many \"drive-bys\", then it is Ok to get out and",
          "If you get a chance, go to the top of the mountain and enjoy the statute and view from the base of the statute.",
          "You can find these statues in almost every major town, they have a very long and interesting history on the changes to their religious practices. Well worth the visit",
          "History lessen. The statue was a gift given to the town of Cusco by Palestinians who had found refuge there.",
          "We enjoyed the site. It is very busy so do not expect quite time here unless you come very early or late in the day. The view is exciting. You can get many nice images from the site.",
          "We visited the statue of Christ early one morning and it was very quiet. The statue is white and although fairly large, it is no where near the size of Christ the Redeemer in Rio. It was presented to the People of Cusco by the Palestinians in 1943, 5 years before the creation",
          "Giant white statue of Christ that is on a hilltop overlooking Cusco. You can drive to the base, but then there is a walk to get to the statue.",
          "worth the walk and awesome pictures, great view of the city, better than visiting sacsayhuaman close by",
          "My wife and I were here on a Globus tour and this was just a 10-minute stop, from Sacsayhuaman before heading back to Cusco city for the evening. It's nice, but wouldn't really say this was great, aside from the views of the city. The Statue of the White Christ, as it's",
          "This statue is not very tall but can been seen from the centre of Cusco. On the hill beside it are another three crosses. I would not go there just to see the Cross.",
          "So we had the best view of Machupicchu from this place we took amazing picture, and of course you can buy very cheap handycraf around this place",
          "If you have morning free,you should definitely came for a nice walk. The site itself is really small and you will be done in 10min but it's still worth to go there for a nice city view.",
          "This is part of the city tour and it has such interesting history behind it. Definitely go because you can see all of Cusco from this location.",
          "I think you don't need must go up there! that very small and not nice. just see in plaza de armas.",
          "The statue from far away looks so massive, we were expecting more, but when we actually got to the top of the mountain it was a lot smaller than we expected. Lots of tourists and can be very crowded at times so make sure you have a guide that knows the best times to go and knows",
          "Cristo Blanco overlooks the city of Cusco. Excellent view of the city. Lots of opportunities to buy souvenirs. Doesn't take long to visit. Easy walk from the parking lot.",
          "This was just an okay spot to see. Since it is not that old it was not that interesting. There were tons of locals there when we went and lots o families flying kites",
          "The statue is located on top of a hill, it is a nice quiet spot, we spotted a few locals and alpacas roaming about. It is good spot to see the entire Cusco valley.",
          "I walked up early to avoid the crowds. It is well worth the effort. The climb is not difficult, but the statue is very impressive and the view of Cusco is beautiful.",
          "Kool but dont go there on purpose...go have a look t it if you go visit the beautifull archeological site of Sacsayhuaman",
          "Not worth up a separate hike, but easy to do when visiting Saksaywaman. The statue is not that imposing, and near a main bus stop for touring buses.",
          "A smaller version of the statue of Christ in Rio de Janiero. Very cool to see. Scenic views abound here.",
          "After exploring the Sacsayhuaman site, we walked to the White Cristo nearby. From the statue, the view of the city of Cusco below is unsurpassed! Definitely worth visiting both these sites.",
          "A nice addition to a visit to sacsayhuaman ruins but by no means essential. Its just another statue of Jesus in South America and one that is quite underwhelming in terms of stature. The views from here and the surrounding area are lovely as they look over Cusco city (which is",
          "On the very top of the hills above Cusco we found this enormous statue of Christ looking down into the Valley. We visited the statue during our tour of Sacsayhuaman",
          "We hiked up from Plaza de Armes which was a great way to see the city, some of Sacsayhuaman (need your pass to get in the gate...or take a cab for a few sol which is what three of us did as we were getting tired from the climb), and the surrounding views.",
          "If you're in the area, on a bus tour or visiting nearby attractions it's as good a place as any I suppose. Not really my scene though, thronged with pushy tourists elbowing each other out of the way to get their shot! Better ways to spend the day like...",
          "Statue was donated by the arabs of Palestine---wonder why? Great walk back down into city from here also.",
          "Great view of the Cusco city. Should be combined with other nearby activities. Location is well maintained. At night we can see the statue lit up from the market square.",
          "I'm not religious but I always wonder how could alll these people thing that the father of jesus would want to see his kid with nails in his hands on a cross, wouldn't you think they are trying to say hey well do this to you if you come to. But I'm not religious. Its nit\\ce to",
          "I reached the Statue of Christ after walking through the winding streets of San Blas. It was a beautiful sunny day and the area is a great place to spend time looking in local shops and then heading towards the statue. Take a picnic and hang out with a few llamas as you look",
          "We visited this as part of a day's tour, and the best thing is the spectacular views of Cusco and the surrounding mountains. The statue is noticeable because of being white and stands imposingly watching over the city. Not a significant experience for a Protestant, and one of",
          "If you want to see a greater Cusco then its pretty cool to come up here. Can be windy and lots of souvenirs for sale but the sellers are not pushy",
          "Obviously not as large/high as the statue in Brazil, but a lovely view of the mountains and Cusco from here, also has stone ruins of interesting villages in the nearby areas...",
          "Not as large as its doppelg\u00e4nger in Rio, but can be seen from square in town centre up in the mountains",
          "Great views of Cusco. We took the double decker bus tour to visit this and a few other sites. Bus was a good tour and inexpensive.",
          "We went here as part of our walking tour. We took a mini bus good for 24 people from San Cristobal Plaza and Church. It's a 10 minute drive. Along the way we stopped about 150-200 meters away from Saksayhuaman. The place is huge and amazing huge rocks piled on top of the other.",
          "Part of a tour to go there. Great views. Can also see Saxaywayman from here too. Go early to avoid crowds.",
          "This may be just another giant statue of Jesus; however, the view of the city and surrounding mountains is terrific!",
          "It was a nice gesture by the Palestinians to give Cusco this statue. It is not a spectacular monument, but it is interesting.",
          "The Cristo blanco statue is not all too impressive on its own as it is surrounded by wire fencing and therefore is a little bit obstructed once you reach the actual statue. However, the views from the platform near the statue are very good on a clear day and you can see all of",
          "The statue is interesting but not great piece of art, however the location is great and the view of Cusco from this hill is worth to visit this site. It is on the way to Tamobomachay.",
          "Going up to the statue was one of my favorite things within Cusco city. There is a local bus (colectivo) that stops right by the statue. The bus ride up was a blast, as it winds through the narrow streets on the hill. To me it was part of the experience of the statue! I think it",
          "Cristo Blanco is a landmark over the city. Yet if you get up close, there isn't much special about it. Folks at the Sacsayhuaman site might as well walk a half kilometer to see it. Otherwise, pull out your best zoom lens, and take a picture of it from the Plaza. The views",
          "The walk up is a little challenging especially if you have just arrived and are dealing with altitude adaptation. The views are stunning and worth the trip. Not much else to see on the top. It is a place where the Peruvian and international tourists meet. The pathway is easy to",
          "Just my point of view but I am just not into Religious Statues (exception Christ the Redeemer over Rio which is stunning) let alone this ugly statue which sticks out like a sore thumb. I think it spoils the really picturesque wooded & natural Incan terraced site of",
          "This was a surprise, hadn't heard about it. It can be seen from all over the city, a gift honoring the country for providing refuge to Europeans during WWII.",
          "The main attraction here is the view of the city. If you walk from the Plaza de Armas up to Sacsayhuaman (it's uphill but totally doable), you will get the same views with the bonus attraction of a very impressive ruins site.",
          "This Statue is worth a stop if you are driving by. I would not make a drive to it on its own. The view is great.",
          "Just another Jesus statue with the advantage of having Sacsayhuaman as a backdrop. You'll see it if you go to Sacsayhuaman but it's not worth seeing on its own.",
          "You can see this statue from most os Cusco so if you had a good lens this is the best view. At the site the ground in front drops off so very hard to get front photo. Good from side or rear. The tourist bus goes there and other sites and the usual tourist stop at a shop to",
          "Lovely white statue on the crest of the mountainside, with the right lighting (sun angle) you can get a great photo",
          "We visited Christo Blanco whilst on an open-top panoramic bus. We weren't expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised at the incredible views the statue offers! Cusco is such a beautiful city surrounded by enormous mountains, and you don't really realise this until you see it",
          "Beautiful white statute showing the devotion of Christianity of the Peruvian people in Cusco. Nice walk. Nice views of this quite large city.",
          "Fantastic photo op next th SECHUI HUAMAN temple site (also a MUST see). This location is a short stop to take picture of the whole city. The statue is nice but small compared to Rio's or Dili's",
          "The actual statue and accompanying crosses are not much to see or talk about. The views over Cusco is what makes this truly worthwhile. You get a good feel for the style and setting of the city and its buildings. A good 5-10 minute stop on the way out of Cusco.",
          "If you start in San Blas Square and hike up the long set of stairs above the fountain there, you will end up very close to this statue. Interestingly, based on the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brasil (Rio), it was given to the city by a group of thankful Palestinians who took",
          "Located on the top of a mountain outside of Cusco. Reminds of Rio. There are nice ruins right nearby.",
          "As other reviewers have said, you get a fabulous view from the statue over Cusco however it's hard to rate it highly as there's not much else here. It's def worth the short but steep hike or bus journey to experience the view but you will only spent probably 20-30 minutes here",
          "Title says it all Great View. Not much but the statues there. There were a few street vendors encamped at the base. We walked up farm Cusco but is as decibel by car.",
          "We walked up a very unique way, through alleys and stairways by houses. Don't buy the horseride from the horse guy. It's worth it to see the views of the City and then go to the Saucsayhuman nearby. You're in Cusco, might as well!",
          "It`s very worthy to go up there!! I suggets doing on the way back from horseback riding. You get to see the whole city!! It`s a awesome view!!",
          "A good view of the town achieved with a short hike up the hill. Little else to do once you are there unless this forms part of a bigger trek around nearby Sacsayhuaman.",
          "Mainly worth visiting for the view, though you probably get a better view from Sacsayhuaman itself. If you're driving it's a quick stop on the way to Sacsayhuaman. There was an interesting kiting party going on just below the monument when we were there.",
          "This statue is a super miniature version of the huge one found in Rio de Janeiro. We came here on a city tour and at the top there were a bunch of kids flying kites as well as llamas to take pictures with. This is a cool place to visit especially for the view of the city down",
          "It is worth wandering up to Christ to get great views of Cusco. It is is not too much of a walk from the top of San Blas. You also get decent views from Sacsayhuaman if you want to skip Jesus.",
          "Have a stop here if you can it gives a good view of the city, not the biggest christ but still a reasonable structure. You can get a good perspective of the old and the new from here.",
          "This is one of the highlights of Cuzco! It sits atop the city, and watches over it. You can get great views of the city below. The statue itself, is beautiful and white. At night, is is lit, and glows white. There are also 3 crosses next to the right of the statue. It is",
          "We visited the statue on our way back to Cusco. It was not on our itinerary but our driver offered to stop there, so we accepted the opportunity. You can see the statue from Cusco and it pops up very now and then on the road back from all the ruins and the sacred valley. If",
          "The white Statue of Christ is a gift to the city of Cusco from the people of Lebanon in 1940s. One can see the statue from the main square in Cusco. It took us 15 to 20min in a van to get to the statue from Cusco main square. Excellent views of the Cusco city from the statue.",
          "Impressive at night as the statue is illuminated and looks down over Cusco. I found the Sacsayhuaman ruins just behind this statue to be more impressive.",
          "Just a bit higher than San Blas, you can walk up to the Christ and enjoy a great view on the city of Cusco",
          "I took a cab to the statue and then walk/hiked back down. The statue itself is nice but what makes this a must is the view of the entire city to include \"Sacsayhuaman\" which is located a few hundred feet from \"Cristo\". (hint- I did not visit Sacsayhuaman and chose to just look",
          "Be sure to carve out time to visit Cristo Blanco. You won't be disappointed by the views. If it's sunny, you'll enjoy a breathtaking look at Cusco and many of its marquee sites.",
          "I walked up to the Statue of Christ twice, mainly because I liked walking up the stairs. I think the scenery and views of Cusco from this location are beautiful! You get a great view of the entire city and country side. The statue itself is not real memorable. I just don't",
          "My guide and I walked from Cusco city center to San Blas and on to the statue. It was a long walk, but we saw such beautiful and tranquil neighborhoods along the way. It was steep, so wear very comfortable shoes and watch the altitude effects. Worth the walk!",
          "It is an imposing feature above Cusco, but looks pretty worn up close and obviously needs maintenance. The story behind the statue is interesting. I recommend seeing it from some distance and not bothering to visit.",
          "Most interesting thing about it, is the brass plate indicating that it was built by the arab people of Palistine....But why?",
          "Walked to Cristo Blanco from the main square in Cusco which took about 45 minutes with a few stops. There's also buses if you're short on time. There were stunning views and makes you appreciate how big Cusco is. Well worth the trip up and also good training for climbing at",
          "If you are looking for a great spot to overview Cusco and the Valley, this is it. Best enjoyed late afternoon, when the sun casts the beautiful city and the scenery into a golden light. If you don't want to walk up all the steps, there are collectibles or taxis which take you up",
          "Worth the walk for a view over the city and a photo. If you don't have much time in Cuzco I wouldnt bother.",
          "It's quite unimpressive. There are other things that are much nicer to see. You can see it from the temple of the lightning god, sacsahyuaman, that will be more than enough. Granted, you have a good view of the city, but cuzco looks fairly unimpressive from above.",
          "This is another site that is beautiful and has a great overlook of the city of Cusco. It's not necessary to go right up to the base in order to enjoy it, though.",
          "Our guide took us here on the way to another site. You will get a good view of the city and be able to take some good pictures. There were some hikers playing guitars while we were there and they were actually good.",
          "You drive right past this on the standard half day tour to Sacsayhuaman. It wasn't in our program but our guide was kind enough to have the driver pull in so we could enjoy the view. Definitely a worth a quick photo stop.",
          "We visited this site on a double decker bus tour and also hiked to this point as a training hike with Action Peru Treks. Beautiful site and loved seeing the Christ light up at night on the hill.",
          "The statue is a turistic attraction, more because of the city view than from properly the statue. You have a beautiful view of the city, the mountains around and the Sacsayaman site. If you get to the statue you are walking distance from the ruins.",
          "Close to town and Sasayhuman. Easy to get to but not worth extra trip. A few people walked over to view it up close.",
          "There's a decent view over Cusco and suburbs, but the scenery is rather typical of South American cities - plenty of poorly constructed house and hints of shanty areas. Plenty guides around taking pictures of their charges at this regular stopping point for them. Statue",
          "This tall statue towers over the Cuzco valley and is worth walking up to. Without a guide, you will take a picture and leave quickly. Its background might take another 5 to 10 minutes. It is worth seeing up close as part of the Incan temple visit.",
          "This is smaller than Christ the redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. Still, it has its own beauty. It can be seen at plaza de armas or sacsayhuaman too.",
          "We walked here from Sacsayhuaman which was only like a 5 min walk. The statue itself if surrounded by a fence and barbed wire so it doesn't make for very good photos but I'd still go just for the beautiful views of Cusco",
          "Standing tall above the city, the statue is most impressive at night, as the light is illuminating it. It is also pretty in the day time, but the best time to see it is at night. You don't have to go up to it, just drive somewhere in the city where it is visible.,",
          "We enjoyed walking from our AirBnB place in San Blas to Sacsayhuaman, then across to Cristo Blanco (White Christ) and down the steep staircases back down into town. The views were beautiful!",
          "nice statue, but you cannot get a good location to take a photo without a fence being in the way. Ok since it is free.",
          "You can see it from many areas, just take your picture and move on. Not much up close that makes it worth the walk up.",
          "Combine a visit here with Saqsayhuman. You can walk to the statue. It is also great to see from the city itself as it is lit up at night.",
          "Not worth a visit by itself, but if you are on your way to Pisac or some other attraction and you are in the area is OK for a five minute stop. You do get a good view of Cusco but other than that ther is not much to see.",
          "Looks good from afar. But does not match the hype. Location & view from there is awesome. But such statues are aplenty especially after Cristo , the Redeemer , in Brazil , it is diminutive !",
          "From the main plaza in Cusco you can look up to this and it is a sight to behold! And from here, during the day, the overlook over Cusco is phenomenal. This is also at the edge of Saqsaywaman, btw.",
          "This is a great stop if going to Saqsaywaman Ruins. I wouldn't make it a point to visit if you've gone to the statue in Lima or Rio in Brazil. The views of the entire city however are spectacular from this point.",
          "First day in Cusco, went for a bite, then decided to hike up to the statue. We took the challenging way, through town, up the trail, through a neighborhood, through a brush area, finally arriving. Thought my lungs were going to explode. Very excited when made it up. We continued",
          "This was our first stop after arriving in Cuzco. Amazing view with a good workout for your lungs too.",
          "While touring the city, it is easy to see the statue of Christ from different areas of the city. It was a simple statue, but great to see. The statue stands in appearance like the one in Brazil. I had no idea that they had their own statue of Christ! Nevertheless, if you are",
          "As part of a walking tour of Cusco, we visited the Cristo Blanco. It was an exhilarating uphill walk which not only allowed us an opportunity to visit the statue but also provided panoramic views of the city. If you have the energy, get up there and take a look!!",
          "We took the bus up to the Statue of Christ, or Cristo Blanco (1 sole per person). It is really easy. Catch the bus in the centre or on Recoletta as we did. The bus will say Cristo Blanco on the front. The bus winds up through town and stay on until the houses stop and you",
          "The statue is breathtaking when you see if from across the city. I would recommend, however, not driving up to actually walk around it. It has a metal fence and spotlights around the base and the paint is peeling and chipped. It looked so sad up close but so beautiful from afar.",
          "A big white statue of Christ on top of the hill. Pretty self explanatory. Not as big as we were expecting, nothing awe inspiring, but interesting enough. Expect to spend 3-5 minutes there enjoying the view of Cusco. Some craft vendors outside. Statue built in 1945 according the",
          "Sadly this is right next to a beautiful Peruvian site that is a couple of centuries old. However the Peruvians are very catholic in their ideology and it is a great vantage point for pics.",
          "Well worth the hike to see the views from this statue. The statue itself is not very big. But the views of Cusco city are why you come here. Very calm and peaceful place. Not many locals selling you things. Right next to Saqsaywaman",
          "but the Inka ruins around the area are much more interesting.Nice place but only as an afterthought to all the really good Inka sites around Cusco. Supposedly provided by Muslim immigrants after WWII it's a nice enough statue",
          "Not as large as the one in Rio but beautiful views of the entire city. Great location for pictures....",
          "The cross standing on the top of the hill is similar to Christ Render in Rio but it is not an attraction worth visiting. It is very nice to look at and as it is visable from almost anywhere in Cusco this can be enough.",
          "The statue of Christ is visible from many parts of Cusco. It's a short walk up a moderate hill that does not seem that difficult until you realize that you are above 11,000 ft. in elevation. It sucks the air out of you. It is actually a better view from a short distance than",
          "I thought it was Christ the Redeemer but it turns out it was a smaller version and no one told me that until I arrived. I had to fly to Brazil and it cost me an extra $2000, I was completely and utterly boned by Jp Hamelins snapchat.",
          "Use GPS to navigate through the suburbs below the statue. Cut through some side streets, climb a few steps and find a short dirt track through the trees. With a bit of skill you can use this route to avoid travelling up the main route and paying up to 70 soles just for",

          "The statue itself isn't particularly interesting, it's sort of creepy actually... but the park area around it gives a great view of the entire city, it's pretty breathtaking. It's totally free to the public, and an easy hike from the city (although taxis and buses are also an",
          "Not a must see from my opinion.It is located in a position high above Cusco.This position allows people to get a good city view.We went as part of a tour group",

          "Interesting park area with Inca ruins. High on a hill the overlooks the city. Great place for a walk on a nice day. Maybe not a \"must see\", but very pleasant place.",
          "It is a nice walk to the Christ and the view is beautiful. I would allow some time to go there and see the whole Cusco.",
          "On one morning, we took the tour bus around the sights (we were suffereing a little from the altitude). The bus slowly trundled up the windey mountainside to the statue of christ. The view from there, looking down at Cusco is breathtaking. Worth while visiting.",
          "If you cannot afford to go to Rio and see the real thing, this comes in as a close third. It is nice to see, since I have been to Rio in Brazil to see the real thing.",
          "The Jesus statue was alright. The view of the city below was better. Definitely a bit of a hike from the town but worth it if you're decently in shape and like walking.",

          "Since you can see this statue from all over Cuzco, it is surprising to get there and find how small it actually is. Maybe that is in comparison the more famous and much larger Christo Redentor statue in Rio, of which this is a miniature. Nevertheless, it is worth a closer",
          "This can be seen from the city. The drive up is very nice and gives some good views. There is anple parking at the top.",
          "This Statue of Christ is similar to the one in Rio, but it is a bit smaller. You have the same sweeping city views. It looks very tiny from the main plaza in Cusco so I would recommend that you go and see it up close.",
          "Almost as nice as the Christ Redeemer in Rio, Brazil, but this statue is much easier to get to, beautiful views and close walk from Sacsayhuaman, definitely a closer look while in Cusco.",
          "I visited here with my wife by sightseeing bus, and we were given ten minutes to enjoy here. The view from this hill to the brown colored village was fantastic. There was a local woman with baby sheep and llama. We took many photos with them with 10 sol (3 USD), which would be",
          "Saw Cristo Blanco from Sacsayhuaman ruins and the Plaza De Armas, that was close enough to get a good glimpse of it...didn't have the extra energy or need to go close as there are way more exciting things to see at Sacsayhuaman and other places with the Megalithic stones.",
          "The statue looked impressive from afar and I reckon the best photo could be taken from a distance. In close proximity the statue is very clean, white and looked like it was built this year. I didn't walk around it, but it was not as big as the one in Brazil.",
          "We took a city tour on an old trolley and this was one of the stops. (We really recommend the trolley tour). We stopped here for 10 minutes to take pictures with the statue and the view of the city of Cusco. There were some souvenir vendors and a lady there offering a baby",
          "Its kind of a long walk, but everything in Peru is like that. More to see elsewhere, unless you have the time. Enjoy.",
          "I hiked up to \"Christoph Blanco\" 3 times this trip. There is an easy way, a medium hard way and a goat path. I would not recommend the goat path. The easiest way to hike from San Blas is to pass through the gate that goes to Sacsayhuaman however, they will tell you you need a",
          "We had the chance to go all the way up to the statue and very much appreciated the views from up there. The statue stands tall and looks over the city night and day and is lit up at night for a more dramatic overview. Beautiful statue and well worth driving up there for the",
          "Well, it is a big statue. Hard to get a good photo due to the fence around it. The view of the city is nice though. There was a lady with a lama that you could take photos with for a donation. I was not overly impressed. It is a place to stop for photos. No tour needed.",
          "Great views of Cusco from there. Use your panorama mode! Turn around and take pictures of Sacasayhuaman as well, not just the city. I like the views in the opposite direction even more.",

          "Known locally as the White Christ this statute towers over Cusco. It is worth a visit to see it first hand; a huge white statue of Christ with arms outstretched. From this position there is also a fantastic panoramic view of Cusco below. In an evening the White Christ has",
          "Walked the road to the top, great views of Cusco refused to pay the outrageous 130 soles fee to see a mediocre little statue.",
          "Even thoug this is definitely not the tallest statue of this kind, it's just a nice spot to stop by and a really good place to get a panoramic view of the city.",
          "The statue of Christ itself over Cusco is pretty much a waste of time, in and of itself. It's a smallish statue, not a very high quality work, and does not offer anything other than something to look at. It's also surrounded by trinket sellers, tip-seeking persons with llamas,",
          "Cusco is a very charming city! Don't miss the views from this statue landmark. You can get there by bus, but it's more fun to make the 45 minute walk. Start from behind the cathedral and continue up the hill until you find the stairs. Follow the stairs all the way to the top,",
          "We stopped at this site on our bus tour, and although the statue is somewhat impressive, the view is amazing. If you have time, make sure you make your way up the hill for just the views of Cusco. It\u2019s not until I was up here, I realized how large Cusco was.",

          "Overlooking the city of Cusco is the statue of Cristo Blanco (White Christ) - not unlike Rio's Christ the Redeemer. It was built by a group of Christian Palestinians who had sought refuge in Cusco and was their parting gift to the city when they left \u2013 also a symbol of their",
          "There isn't much else to it besides the statue and the wonderful view of Cuzco. You can see the entire city. It was a site to see. You can see the statue from the city as well. At night it is has lights illuminating it. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way just to see it.",
          "You could couple the visit to the statue of Christ while you are exploring sacsayhuaman since the statue is an extension to this complex and there is a trail that you could follow to reach up the hill. Once here, the view is to die for. Nothing will give you such a spectacular",
          "This was an amazing place to view the city as its at 3600 metres which is over 200 metres higher than Cusco. You could also see some of the ruins of Saqsaywawan which is one of the villages in the Sacred Valley.",

          "If you are by Saksaywaman is worth waking a bit more uphill and see this beautiful religious site, specially for the view of Cusco.",
          "Like most tourist, we jumped on a bus to get to the top instead of walking. As everyone has said, besides the statue, there are great views of Cusco. You can easily see Plaza De Armas from the statue. It seems you can never get a good picture of the statue since the sun is",
          "Great view from this point and the statue is quite nice. I saw Christ the Redeemer in Brazil only a few weeks ago, so unfortunately I'm probably comparing it in my mind to that too much, so didn't find this one overly impressive.",
          "I decided to wake up early and go check out the sunrise from this spot. It was a breath-taking view. If you're here before 7am you don't have to pay entrance fee for Cristo Blanco or Sacsayhuaman, which is 5min walk from Cristo Blanco.",
          "We stopped at the statue on a small detour to the airport and so glad we did.. Has an awesome view across the while of Cusco. Th statue itself isn't much to look at as it's all fenced off but definitely go for the view and cheap souvenirs from the locals. Plus it's free :)",
          "A pity about all the fencing around the Cristo Blanco statue, making it difficult to get a decent photo of it. However there is a very good view of Cusco from here. It is adjacent to the Inca site of Saqsaywaman, so we visited the statue at the same time.",
          "This is an amazing site overlooking Cusco. The statue is lit at night and seen from most of Cusco. To approach the statue, you have to go near the Saqsayhuaman ruins.",
          "Cristo Blanco (of White Christ) is located on a hill, which provides a spectacular and panoramic view to the city. The Statue was a gift from the Christian Palestinians who were seeking refuge in Cuzco in 1945. It was a symbol of their gratitude toward the city, and was their",
          "Amazing setting overlooking the whole of the city of Cusco, enjoyed on an open top double deck bus tour of city.",
          "We enjoyed traveling up to this statue at the end of the day and seeing the city from here and the incredible work of the statue. Not sure I would visit again myself, but would recommend it and go with others who hadn't yet seen it.",
          "Going up to Cristo Blanco is free whereas Saqsaywaman is 70 soles each. If you\u00b4re content to read about Saqsaywaman before or afterwards, you will get a pretty good overview from Cristo Blanco (perhaps then decide whether you want to go into the Saqsaywaman archaelogical park).",
          "In my small tour group we headed out of Cusco on our way to Ollantaytambo. Cusco is pretty high above sea level but making our way out of the town we were ascending! This really tested my altitude sickness! It is a pity this statue is completely fenced making pictures look",
          "The view if Cusco was stupendous, but the statue has wire around it making getting a full length pic not an option. There were not to many vendors there, and of course the obligatory dog.",
          "What an amazing view of Cusco. It's right next to the famous inca site Sacsayhuaman. You don't need the tourist ticket if it just want to walk up to the statue - just tell the guy at the gate what you're doing. Great way to test how you're coping with the altitude. I wasn't that",
          "Was surprised to see this statue when visit the inca site of Sacsayhuaman. It's not as large as the redeemer statue in Rio, but is still a sight to enjoy, with the views of cusco below.",
          "A lovely statue with a nice story of its origins. It overlooks the valley below and the lovely Andes all around.",
          "The best thing about this location is the view over the valley, unless you are looking for a little more exercise, I say skip this one, the view from Sacsayhuaman is better.",
          "We took a city tour and there are some ruins right next to it, the place is fantastic but there is some climbing up involved and due to the high attitude it gets extenuating at some point. I just recommended to do it a few days after been in Cusco so you don't get sick.",
          "Can be seen from practically any spot in Cusco, day or night, as it stands on the grounds very close to the impressive site of Sacsayhuaman Inca ruins",
          "Nice statue, but the big fence around it spoils the whole thing... Still a pretty good view over the city though!",
          "I came up to this statue when I entered Sacsayhuaman. Incredible views over Cusco. I also got a taxi up here at night with some friends, the view is even better at night! Although, it is very cold. Definitely worth the walk/taxi ride.",
          "Neat place. Lots of vendors here. Great view of Cusco. Would be a better photo op if you were there at night.",
          "a 2 km hike from centre of cusco, dont attempt until used to altitude other places of interest nearby",
          "Right next to Sacsayhuaman it is part of the park area and a great overlook into the city of Cusco. It is done in a bright white color and is lit at night. A very beautiful and peaceful spot in which you can rest and reflect on the beauty around you.",
          "The \"White Christ\" itself is interesting, but hardly worth going out of your way for. The views of Cusco and Sacsayhuaman, however, make this site worth visiting. Our group did not have time to visit Sacsayhuaman so it was nice to snap some photos of it on the way to and from",

          "good hike to the white jesus and excellent view of cusco from the top!!!",

          "I only recommend to take 3 minutes to take a photo of the city of Cusco on the way to the magnificent Sacsayhuman. I hope this review is helpful to you.",

          "you can't miss it from the city. Not much to look at, but it has a very interesting story behind it. Our guide told us that Islamic Palestinians that immigrated to Cusco during WW2 donated this statute to Cusco as a gift of good hospitality to them when the returned to their"

An alternate Spanish name is El Ba\u00f1o del Inca (\"the bath of the Inca\").\nIt consists of a series of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks. It is situated near springs such as the one called Timpuc Puquiu, a boiling spring on the northern bank of the Timpuc River and the spring near Huaylla Cocha community. These natural springs were channeled through three waterfalls that still flow today.The function of the site is uncertain: it may have served as a military outpost guarding the approaches to Cusco, as a spa resort for the Incan political elite or imperial baths. It could have also served a religious function since sacred water fountains were found almost all of major Incan temple such as Pisac, Ollantaytambo, and Machu Picchu. There are sources that refer to Tambomachay as one of the nine ceques built along the Road of Antisuyu, describing it as an Incan house where sacrifices were also made.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n360\u00b0 view of Tambomachay",

          "We took a private taxi here (and to the other sites around Cusco) and it was super easy to access and walk around. Go early in the morning to avoid the tourist bus rush. If you\u2019ve arrived in Cusco already a little worried about altitude sickness then best to acclimatise before",
          "The tambos are thought to be resting places. Here you can see some of the excellent Inca waterworks, and also the remains of a tower that guarded the Sacred Valley. This place is close to many other archeological sites north of Cusco, so it's best to visit them together.",
          "We took the local bus up to Tambomachay (the bus name is Se\u00f1or del Huerto and the fee was s/ 1.50) and then walked back down to Cusco, passing Puka Pukar\u00e1, Q'enqo, Templo de la Luna, and Saqsayhuam\u00e1n on the way down. This was a beautiful walk, and a great way to pass the",
          "We walked to the 4 ruins of Tambomachay to Pukapukara, Q\u2019engo and lastly to Sacsayhuaman. We caught a taxi to Tambomachay and then walked down along the 8 kms of road to Cusco. There were just 2 of us and a few other random walkers at times and it was safe along the road. We",
          "There was much, much less of it than I expected, but it\u2019s included in the tourist ticket, very near one other site and pretty near two others. I got a local bus and then walked back to Cusco via the others. It\u2019s nice to see the water flowing. I\u2019d seen all the bigger, further",
          "This place is special because of its ability to prove the incredible wonder of the Incan civilisation. Here, you\u2019ll be able to observe how the incans conquered water with fountains and aqueducts pouring out of the hillside. Absolutely lovely and make sure you\u2019ve adjusted to the",
          "We stopped here after a long visit to Sacsayhuam\u00e1n and were not really intrigued. The major draw is the water flowing as part of the Inca irrigation system. It was small and a bit of walk. The area is surrounded with alpacas and the environment is peaceful/relaxing. If you would",
          "For those of you who tend to be inclined toward the spiritual, this place is a must. My wife and I went here with little expectations but found ourselves intensely and profoundly touched spiritually. I'm not going to say that everyone will have this experience, but there are",
          "Another historic site, full of ruins and history. Watch out for the path, its uphill and very unregular. Walk carefully and you will have no problem.",
          "Tambomachay was my favorite spot near Cusco on our Adventure Life tour. It is a bit of a walk up a cobbled path but the terraces and flowing water at the end is well worth it. In a sheltered area, the water flows from springs on the hill as per our guide. The structure itself",
          "There's a lot of walking at this site, but it's worth it. This is a really unique site where the water has been flowing for hundreds of years!",
          "This was the culmination of our City Tour and Ruins. It was fascinating to see all of the aqueducts still fully functional, and as with other locations the impeccable stone work. There were several street vendors in the area as well as a few of alpacas. Worth the stop.",
          "We were blown away by the architecture. How this place was constructed is still a mystery to archeologists today. I wish we had more time to explore! I recommend taking a guided tour!",
          "We visited this site as part of our guided tour. It is pretty small but interesting. There is a little market there to buy local items.",
          "The buildings are well assembled irregular polyhedra, the walls are inclined inward, presenting niches or niches large and spacious. In front of the main building, on the eastern side of the set, stands an incomplete circular keep at the top.",
          "we were hiking from San Blas: unfortunately hiking ways are not marked and lead a long way along the street. But the site is beautiful to see.",
          "A small area built with smaller rocks compared to Saqsaywaman. It showcases the Inkan ingenuity of hydrology. The aqueducts are still functional, water running out of the stone walls.",
          "We stopped here on 1/2 day tour of Cusco. It was just ok - the walk to the ruin took longer than seeing the ruin itself, and the vendors along the path were really pushy. If you are looking to cut down on stops, this one is skippable.",
          "See if you have the time or else give it a miss. The walk to the ruins takes longer than this ruins are worth. We saw the water seeping out of the rock and the other ruins. I think I valued the trees and the cobbled stones walkway more. Other ruins are more impressive if you",
          "Again the talk given here was too long so felt rushed when exploring, would be good if tour guide walked and talked pointing things out instead of standing still",
          "A late afternoon visit on a short tour from Cusco and very worthwhile. Another example of Inca ingenuity. Set in the countryside with Families and animals creating a restful environment..",
          "If you buy the pass to see multiple ruins around Cusco, this is worth the stop, but it's a quick stop. Worth stopping by if you are planning on doing the others along the same road.",
          "This place is great. Not a lot of people visit so it's calm but the ruins are gorgeous and so it the surrounding area.",
          "One of several Inca ruins in the Cusco area. You will have the opportunity to see how they worked natural rock formations into the construction of this site.",
          "Amazing archaeological sites,and seeing the canals of water that the Incas built hundred of years ago still working today is impressive.",
          "This place is really cool! Worth a visit if you are looking for something to do while in Cusco. Not too much information on this site. I believe one of the Spanish chroniclers briefly mentions an Inca Emperor stopping here to rest while travelling between Cuzco and Pisac. The",
          "Although not as impressive as the nearby Sacsayhuaman complex, Tambomachay is a very interesting place where this is believed to be a sacred place for the Inca elite to take baths. The complex is built into the hills and the water comes from the ground; no one really knows",
          "Within the Large temple ( Saqsaywaman) compound, have to walk about 10 to 15 minutes from the main gate ( ticket office) . The ever running spring water flow from the rocks into a small pool . It was for clensing ritual performed by ancient Incas. Interesting walk.",
          "This might seem attractive to many but I did not find this place worth the hype.. Just a normal place.. hardly 10 min.. walk to the small waterfall/fountain whatever you wish to call that and come back.",
          "We stopped by this sight after we arrived in Cusco. We needed more time to explore this sight and we got into town late. This sight has an excellent view of Cusco...bring your wide angle.",
          "This site is also included in the boleto turistico which includes 16 sites in total. Normally part of a tour it was a nice place to visit you can expect to spend between 15 to 30 min here.",
          "This was a part of a tour. We spent very little time here. They did embalming here. Lots of large stones connected. Worth it if it is part of a tour.",
          "If you have at least a day, you should visit this place, not only the place is amazing with the huge carved stones ft with each other so perfectly, but you have a beautiful viewpoint of the city of Cusco from here.",
          "It is part of the archaeological sites, there is not so much to be seen, and it\u00b4s very sunny and hot, not so worthy.",
          "Hike up a slow incline for a few minutes, on the left you will see the amazing fountains cascading down carved stones forming the Incan baths. You can continue on the right, there's a path going up a hill that overlooks the baths. Beautiful views from up there. There's usually",
          "We got the Boleto Touristico and hired a taxi for the morning to take us to all the nearby ruin sites to Cusco. Tambomachay is a beautiful site. The aqueducts and architectural features are pristine, but the surrounding countryside is also stunning. You are able to walk all",
          "We visited this site as one of 4, for which we had purchased the ticket the previous day at the government office, just off the Plaza d Armas. A relatively small site, located close to Puka Pukara, another one of the 4. To get to the Temple of the Water you walk along a well",
          "Even the rain did not bother us, although it was raining cats and dogs that day. There isn't much to see here, but the small construction still amazes when you think how old it is.",
          "This was another site that I would say is a do not miss. There was not as much hiking at this site and it is well preserved. they are still uncovering more.",
          "This area is a bit on the smaller side, but it is worth a visit to learn about the history and the significance of this site. You will definitely want a guide to provide detailed information. The irrigation systems here are particularly interesting and worth learning about.",
          "A inca ruin dedicated to water. The water apparently has qualitys to promote youth so everyone was crowding around to splash it on their faces.",
          "Not much to see, but worth stopping by since it's so close to Puca Pucara. Entrance is included with the Incan sites ticket.",
          "Not for the old or tired, but neat to see since there is some streams coming through the ruins. It would be wise to by the 10 day pass to the ruins of you are renting a vehicle, or in Cusco for a long period of time, since it allows you into museums, and ruins all around Cusco",
          "Excellent knowledge of ink-building technologies. I really enjoyed walking around this place. We had a local guide. We learned a lot.",
          "This was part of our Sacred Valley Tour and a very nice way to spend a day. We were in Cusco for 6 days so we did Tambomachay two days after Macu Picu. (Needed the rest). If you truly love looking around the ruins, you may want to make this your main attraction as our day tour",
          "you will be amazed at the size of the stones. how did they move them and for 4 miles.not chair accesable but easy to wake",
          "There is a long paved path leading from the parking lot to the site. The thin air at 4100 meters above sea level triples the difficulty of the climb. It was believed to be the final resting point for the Inca people on pilgrimage to Cusco. The ruins are not that impressive but",
          "Lots of history including what the area was used for by the Incans. Unfortunately after touring around the area a lot of the ruins look about the same. The interesting parts are the history and what the actual people used the site for.",
          "A small site with a great rock formation, admittedly. Get off the beaten track when visiting and see the views from the upper hills. The photo of one of the rock formations is quite good and exploring the trails above is a good mini-adventure :-)",
          "The altitude is 4.100 meter and you can be altitude sick easily. Don't prefer at your first day in Cusco.",
          "Possible a rest place or a guest house, It is one of the Inca empire archaeological sites Cusco. It consists of a series of aqueducts and canals that run thru the terraced rocks. It is not sure what was the function of thsi site. Some say it was a spa resort for the Incan",
          "The last ruin in the Cusco region trip. It could be something like a water temple. It is not very big but full of tourists. If you really want to see water works go to Tipon",
          "Not too much to see here other than some interesting fountains and a good bit of real estate to wander around on. Up in the hills so you can get a good amount of hill climbing done without too much restriction.",
          "Tambomachay is on the Boleto Touristico & a higher elevation than Sacsayhuaman but not as elaborate. Designed as a waterstop, baths & sacred place on 1 of the Inca routes it still has water flowing over its stones. There's not a huge amount to see but there's also only a few",
          "a temple to the divinity of water. we still do not know were the water comes from, still flowing from Inca Times. incredible...",
          "In a nice setting- kind of foresty, these ruins are well preserved and easily accessible. Up a slight incline, not strenous at all. If you feel more energetic walk over the bridge and up to the viewing spot for a great view. Everything is roped off so you just look from a",
          "A visit that really filled up the respect fore ancient culture and struggel. Nice wiew from down back to Cuzco.",
          "Like most of the Inca sites, if you have the opportunity to see this then you are one of a privileged few and should definitely make the effort.",
          "This was my first stop to explore archaeological sites outside of Cusco--very easy to get to via a tour or by taxi (taxi, approximately 40 Soles--arrange to have your driver wait because it may be difficult to find a ride back to Cusco). Entrance requires the Cusco Tourist",
          "While these ruins were smaller than many nearby they were equally impressive and worth checking out.",
          "This is the temple of water. Three springs continue to flow since Inca time. Beautiful stones fitted so perfectly.",
          "This was an example of Inca hydro collection . Amazed to see how much trouble they had gone to to collect and control the spring water",
          "This is a smaller archaeological area, but on the way to many others, so worth stopping at. Interesting history and very pretty.",
          "We visited here as part of our city tour. From the carpark it was a 10 minute walk. Our guide told us that this is where Royalty and the wealthy would bathe to cleanse themselves before walking the Inca Trail of 140kms. You get nice photos if you walk up a small path to look",
          "Used for ritual sacrices mainly using black lamas, our guide pointed out that humans were sacrificed when other sacrifices appeared not to be doing their work of appeasing the gods. The structure is quite elaborate and the altar has a window allowing light in. The altar is",
          "The modern entry to Tambomachay felt like we were on my way to a winery- beautiful trees and well-maintained walkways. Once we reached the main attraction, the place was overrun with tourists that there is no place for quiet and contemplation. Noisy tourists swarm close to the",
          "As part of the X Zone tour we went to this site. Easy walk uphill to the area. Very interesting site...loved the water features. So glad we went.",
          "This is an Incan gem near the city of Cusco paying tribute to water. The Incas worshiped nature above all else and all of their architectural wonder is an homage to nature and this is no different. Having said this, I highly recommend you see this before heading out to Tipon in",
          "the structures are breath taking .perfect for meditate and contemplate is a very nice walk with lots of water .",
          "You can get an uber there for about 15 soles then walk back stopping off at the other sites. Nothing spectacular. Just go to sacsayhuaman if you're short on time",
          "Upon entering the site, we were met with a couple of women dressed in the peruvian traditional dress sitting with some of their alpacas and / or llamas. We can take photos with them at a price (not so hefty, whatever you're willing to give). There's a path we had to go through",
          "we saw it as part of a city tour, it was a nice to place to visit and to know about as it was on of the starting point to the inka trail (the full trek)",
          "This Inca site was near the end of our tour and less spectacular than the ruins at Pisaq, but pretty neat!",
          "This site isn't as cool as Sacsayhuaman or Qenqo but worth taking a quick walk to look at. Make sure you have a taxi stay for you otherwise it's a long walk back to town.",
          "Waterfalls but not natural. Made by the Inkas thousands of years ago and still working today. Very interesting hike up to the falls",
          "Our tour today took in several Inca sites, Tambomachay was one of them. This site served as a retreat/spa for the Inca hierarchy, we could only view it from the service road, I don't know if there much more to see. It looked quite peaceful with it's water running through the",
          "Small Inca Ruin that wasn't very impressive to see and visit. Worth a quick visit. I don't consider this to be a must-do while at Cusco.",
          "This was part of our tour around Saqsayhuaman. Interesting site, especially the watch tower. Learned a lot about Incas. The water fountain still brings water from 4km away.",
          "If you haven't seen enough amazing Quechua stonework at the other sites you've visited, and have a few spare minutes in the afternoon, then this might be a worthwhile stop. It's a 8-10' walk from the entrance and is a small but picturesque site.",
          "This is a good place to start your visit of the Inca sites around Cusco - take a taxi up to the top here (or bus) and then you can wander around this site and walk downhill to the other three sites between here and Cusco - exploring at your own pace. Best to have a Lonely",
          "it was royal residence with sacred water; really interesting architecture and endless/unlimited water flow; it was too cold and windy (winter season), it's higher that Cusco, so it's better to have warm clothes with you; but it's a question for separate visit; we made it as a",
          "Beautiful, while walking through this impressive site you get nothing but huge respect for the Incas. This part of the Sacred valley is a must see,",
          "Only with a guide you can understand why Inca built-create this place and for what reason. It consists of a series of canals, pipes, ditches, tunnels and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks. The function of the site is to convey water and it may have served as a",
          "The Inkas built this for water. The lead some irrigation here and water flows from the ruins. Overall, not very exciting and very crowded. I would not make a special stop for this.",
          "A little walk up a 'driveway' sort of place then you get to Tambomachay and it is very small. Very nice place for a quick visit.",
          "This site is really neat and lots of different trails and views and a lot of history. We really loved it and it was worth the trip. Some of the trails were narrow or steep but not very difficult - just take your time.",
          "The place that was meant to be visited by the royals when it was built is now open for us. The water runs cold here and was meant to purify souls and bodies",
          "wonders of the world magnificent Inca site you will be in awe ...the depth of Inca knowledge and integration with the natural ...",
          "This site is across from puca pucara and its a series of baths. Its purpose its debated between historians. We were told it was a shrine to the god of water but that it was also a spot, for travelers visiting the empire's capital, to rest and resupply. Visit also Puca pucara,",
          "Although Tambomachay is a rather small site, it is definitely worth your while. Set in a beautiful side valley, the site features a tree-lined avenue leading to the springs, a small local market, alpacas and, of course, the sacred springs themselves. Do explore the area and take",
          "It was one of our favorite places in Cusco. On the way to Sacred valley, so it is a stop you should consider.",
          "As I didn't have a guide what I gather is this is the equivalent of a spa. It's a small site with a pleasant walk up to it. I enjoyed the stroll around it, getting different angles for photos.",
          "I took the collectivo 1Sol one way to this places 1st: Tambomachay- just a stroll towards this aqua duct system. There's a path that goes up the opposite way so you can see how it looks like from above 2nd: Puka-Pukara- from the parking lot/entrance of Tambomachay, you can see",
          "Among the ruins close to Cuzco, saqsayhuaman wins by far! However to combine the ruins by walking was a nice advice we got. We took a taxi here and walked down through the woods (maps.me app is necessary!). Its a nice afternoon expedition and on your way you can visit",
          "In the two days in Cusco before a 4 day/3 night hike, it was recommended that we see the ruins just outside of Cusco. We took a relatively short (and slightly terrifying taxi ride) to Tambomachay with the intention of walking back down to see the other three sites. If you have",
          "the same inka motives come more and more times until you are fed up of them. go there only if you have a special interest.",
          "Another of the Inca sites near Cusco; not too far from Sacsayhuaman. This is much more serene with a lovely fountain visited after a short walk. Very much liked this visit.",
          "Usually combined with a tour of Sacsayhuaman, and a few other smaller sites, Qenqo (Q'inqo) and Puka Pukara, this is probably the most interesting of the three smaller sites. A short hike up a roadway, past some small canals (high elevation - huff/puff) leads you to some",
          "Since this was part of our 4 site ticket, we decided to take a look. Some believe that Tambomachay was an Incan shrine to water (some kind of aquaducts system), whilst others think that it was a military outpost guarding the entrance to Cusco. Tambomachay has a complex system",
          "Not very big but a nice stroll to see some waterfalls of this Inca ruin. In combination with Puca Pucara, Qenqo and Sacsayhuam\u00e1n it still is a nice half day tour and good use of your BTC. Get a private taxi so you are not in a crowd and you can stay as long/short as you wish.",
          "This is a small Inca ruin near to Cusco, the main point of interest being the complex of water paths. Worth a quick look while on the way to e.g. Sacsayhuaman. You'll get more from the site if you have a tour guide.",
          "Like other travelers have said this is very small & not really worth a trip/stop. We stopped here on a half day Cusco tour so it wasn't completely out of the way for us since we were going to Sacsayhuaman, but if you don't see it on a tour it's not worth stopping at.",
          "The site is very small ( I literally spent there 15 minutes). And there isn't much to see. So unless you know the Inca culture very well and this site is on your bucket list, I do not recommend it (especially if you do not have much time in Cusco). If you have more time, you",
          "This Inca ceremonial purification fountain complex is in front of Puca Pukara and while small, still very interesting with a very important part of Inca religion and visually very nice. Certainly worth the visit",
          "This series of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks associated with the Inca Empire is in absolutely perfect condition today, 1,000 years after being built. This is one of the 4 constructions on a combination ticket for the Inca cultural tour,",
          "If you love history and are in good health , this is the top of the world. You will be amazed .The people are so proud of it 's story, once you visit , you too will help pass on the power of how they lived , died and continued to teach.by doing.",
          "Loved our visit to this site. Our guide brought this site to life for all of us -- more than just a tourist site.",
          "we did an afternoon bus tour of the historic inca sites above cusco and tambomachay was the last stop before dark. the hike is a little challenging at nearly 12,000 feet elevation but worth it. we made it there right at dusk and the sunset was fabulous. the preserved stone",
          "The amount of knowledge the Incas must have had to create such places. They even had running water. A great place to explore.",
          "Its a slight walk up, maybe 15-20 minutes before you hit the water fountains, Apparently this was a place where priests and holy folks would pause and stop at before continuing on their journey, Lots of locals selling the typical products and food. Its something cool to see if",
          "As is obvious from the title, this site was the standout from the other Inca sites in the area. Both in terms of architecture and the possible theory behind its existence, this one took the cake for me. So what's on offer? Three different layers of the Incan stone architecture",
          "One can not tell from the pictures how impressive the construction of the sights are without seeing it in person. The work ethic, engineering, and quality of the construction is unbleievable",
          "I came here as part of a group tour. It is not a big site but it is still worth your while especially if you are in the area . You could still see the water flowing down as it had for the last 500 years. Let me find a modern institution whose pipings can last 50 years. Very",
          "This site does not take long to visit however not that impressive. It is a easy walk from the entrance to the \"fountain\"....which is two streams of water coming out of a stone structure. You can walk up to a higher point but no one in our group thought it was necessary. There",
          "The lost empire of the Incas is found here, and near Cusco. Once we visited the sites, we have more undrstanding of their culture",
          "Part of an afternoon tour but very interesting and there were few tourists here. Good photos and there was opportunity to purchase fro the locals.",
          "Learning about the Inca's history and belief system was beautiful. Their connection and belief in the power of nature was evident in a place like this. The structure and respect of nature and water greatly impacted my perception through the rest of my time in Peru.",
          "The Inca built Tambomachay as both a storage facility for their food supplies, and a source of water. Today, the water flows as it did centuries ago and its source is still unknown. An interesting fact is that its flow is constant, year round. Tambomachay is also an excellent",
          "Near Cusco and on the Sacred Valley you will find several Tambos. Tambomachay is very simple, but it is on the way and will only take 30 minutes to visit. Tambomachay is a place where you can see the Inca control over water resources: an uninterrupted water fountain with",
          "This was a place for Inca Royalty. One can only imagine how long it took to construct since everything was done by hand...the foundations and stone settings must have required a combination of brute strength and ingenuity.",
          "The short walk along the nice alley with trees and beck is already a relief after buzzing city. Take your time at the fountain itself, the setting which does not shine through size but the nice arrangement of stones and the symmetry. Walk to the lookout on the other side (5",
          "Part of our tour included a visit to this Incan ruin. It was a small hike but with this altitude, felt like a long arduous trek. We were constantly reminded to take it easy. I think it's worth the small walk to view this water temple because of how well preserved it still is.",
          "The waterfalls in this place make it unique and peaceful. It's a short walk from the main road and well worth the walk. Nearby Cusco so you can hire a taxi an cover this and the 2 other forts nearby",
          "Smaller ruins but very interesting due to showing how the Inka did their irrigation. Beautiful to walk around. Easy to get to by car. Short walk. Surrounded by working farm where we saw sheep being herded, etc..",
          "We enjoyed our brief visit to Tambomachay. It's a very peaceful spot, and it's easy to imagine the Incan nobles resting here on a hot summer day.",
          "We visited this site on a \"city tour\" of Cusco and really enjoyed what we saw. I wouldn't go out of your way to access this attraction, as its small and can be seen quite quickly, but I would strongly encourage you to visit it as part of a tour including other nearby sites.",
          "Powerful at the first look! Felt like a mix of magic and history to imagine what the Inca people went through when building Tambomachay. The details and organization of the structures are amazing. The best is when you are at the top... the view of the sacred valley from there",
          "Need to be visited in you are around Cusco so we got amazed about how those construction were built and of course this place was taken for paradise",
          "It is an archaeological site near Cusco, 7 km and right next to Puka Pukara. The visit could be combined with Saksaywaman and all done with a Taxi. It consists of a series of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks.",
          "I loved this little site with working water fountains tucked up into the hill. Just another marvel of Inca engineering.",
          "If you are in Cusco, make sure you take the day tour of the area and visit the sites. You will not regret it.",
          "you can do this tour on your own my group of friends walked towards this place and it was amazing, you will enjoy this place very much",
          "Imposible to escribe the amazing architecture! The hidden stairs, the size of the rocks that made up the walls.",
          "I was delighted by this place I certainly liked it,The construction, the water fallI will recommend this place",
          "We went here as part of our Gate1 tour. We also went across the street. Not a large site but interesting with the water flow, has some very nice stonework. There was a lady sitting with some alpaca and got some good photos..",
          "Great place to appreciate the Incan engineering and architecture. Lots of steps. Not a place that would be easy for some with disabilities to navigate.",
          "Experience the amazing Inca Culture, the history is fascinating . You can walk this site is as little as an hour if you only have a bit of time but its worth spending a few hours exploring,",
          "This attraction is included on the Cusco tourist ticket and is out of town. It was included as part of our city tour and interesting to see though not a must see.",
          "This site is part of a tour you can visit easily on your own. From the university of Cuzco, you take the bus Huerta. You get of at Tambomachay where you can start your discovery. Tip: bring your guide since the sites doesn't provide you any specific information. After this",
          "We visited this place on a day tour and it was very interesting! Our guide spoke excellent English so he told the history the way a true historian would!",
          "Not a large site but interesting with the water flow, has some very nice stonework. If you want to do a bit of hiking, just follow the river upstream and there are terraces and other small constructions scattered around the hillsides. Access it with the Boleto Turistico ticket",
          "If you are doing a tour of the nearby ruins to cusco, this is probably on the list. This is one of the smaller sites but still interesting to make the stop. It doesnt take but about 10 minutes to walk to the top of the site. One of the few spots in these ruins where you will",
          "The Incan architecture is amazing. This water system at Tambomachay is representative of how they were able to obtain there water through a sophisticated channel system, using large rocks that were precisely fitted together. You can pay for this attraction as a part of the",
          "It is a beautiful water fountain from the inca times, it is close to Sacsayuman which an amazing inca palace remains most of destroyed by Spanish Inquisition . It is nice place to go in a sunny day to appreciate the view of Cusco city",
          "This place is like nowhere else I have ever been. The sheer enormity of the rock is awe inspiring. Lots of walking and climbing so make sure you're up for it and obvo wear comfortable shoes. Possible to walk back to cusco after and the route is very special so don't miss that",
          "Tambomachay is a very interesting example of Inka engineering prowess. Presented as eternal fountains, the site, which is not huge, offers a view of how the Inka's worked hydrological engineering and were able to build ever lasting fountains in a beautiful mountain setting. Well",
          "Nice but small site outside of Cusco. The ruins are small but it is a fair walk up to them. The spring waters are still running . I just rated this average because of the other magnificent sites in the area.",
          "When I visited this place, I didn't realize that what it was until I read more about it that night. Kind of interesting area, one of several places on the Tourist Ticket.",
          "While not the biggest ruins, it's impressive how the water still runs and if the light is right you get some great pics.",
          "This was the \"Kings Retreat\" back when the Incas were alive. Make sure you book this trip with a tour guide so he can provide history on this area. It also makes it easier to have a guide, so he can worry about the transportation getting you to this wonderful place.",
          "A must see when in Cusco. You won\u2019t be disappointed. Be sure to spend plenty of time (at least 3 hours) to get to see everything.",
          "Inka ruins that are close to Cusco (possible to visit by the tour) and is part of the tourist ticket",
          "Beautiful place to walk and admire yet another example of Inca architecture : the water temple, where the kings retreated and relaxed. Great photo opportunities of llamas and alpacas against this magnificent backdrop.",
          "This is a ruin with a series of aqueduct,waterfall and canal through the wall of rock bed. It is a lot of tourist bus arrived since it is located 5 miles from Cusco.A tourist spot is better with tour guide.",
          "It's definitely worth taking a bus, taxi or car to reach this sacred site, which then can be reached by an easy walk in from the entrance. Access to the temple is now limited (since I visited 20 years ago) although it is possible to climb higher to at least touch these sacred",
          "WOW such an incredible place. the size was incredible. well worth the climb to the top. One. She made it come to life. of my favorite places due to the size and is's function. We had a great tour guide Rosemary from Condor Travel",
          "This was an interesting place to visit but, out of the several sites we visited in this area, probably not on the top of our list.",
          "In the Sacred Valley you are at 9,600 feet so when you begin to climb to these ruins, you are going up from there. We were able to to it without too much difficulty, but some with breathing problems chose not to try it. Better have a really good fact book with you if you don't",
          "Machu Pichu is where the priests lived and worshiped, but here is where the Inca kings lived and ruled. It overlooks Cusco which was the center of life for the Inca. Even The Spanish made Cusco its capital. Tambomachay is massive complete with wild alpacas strolling along.",
          "We visited Tambomachay, the Water Temple, as part of a half-day tour provided by Valencia Travel. It's a short walk from the parking lot and is a small, interesting site.",
          "Nice walk, you might be able to hire a guide at the entrance. The place doesn't have signs to help you understand what you are looking at. Local crafts (texttile) can be purchased on site.",
          "A historic Inca water temple a short drive outside of Cusco. Interesting history about the water installations and the history, but otherwise not that interesting.",
          "A short ride from Cusco, these ruins offered yet another glance into Incan life. Unlike other ruins, these did not require a lot of work to visit. Not a lot of climbing or anything that might limit those with less physical stamina. While perhaps not a must-see, nonetheless worth",
          "Even though this site is not as impressive as some of the othe Inca and pre-Inca sites; it is worth the visit. Go there alone and hope you don't get a few busloads of uninterested tourists spoiling the visit. When staying in Cuzco take a taxi that takes you to Tambomachay and",
          "Not really much to see. Tacked onto most half day tours. Very steep if you are not acclimated. Not much to really see either. A fountain and a few small buildings.",
          "As a part of half day tour to 4 sites through tour company Americana de Turismo. There is nothing much to see except small structure and continuous water flow from Inca time. It's nice 200 meter walk and photo opportunity.",
          "This is part of a series of archaeological sites outside Cusco, and part of the S/.130 (US$40) multi-site tourist ticket. Many tour shops offer half-day tours of all four. I brought my family, and had read up on Cusco and Incan culture. So we got a ride (taxi works fine) to",
          "The Tambomachay water temple is a small site that can be visited quickly but very close to Q'uengo, Puka-Pukara and Sacsaywaman - and also entry is already part of the \"Boleto Turistico\". The stone work is beautiful showing the use of natural rock blended with building stones.",
          "We visited this place as part of a tour of inca sites. It's a short uphill walk from the car park on an easy path. The fountains and structures are easy to see from the path. It's very interesting to hear the history. There is a very small cave above the fountains but it's not",
          "The tour took us to this beautiful place, after walking about 200 meters, you can see the water networks that were used in those times.",
          "Our first introduction to the Inca civilization while on our city tour with Audley Travel. Great uphill walk to prepare for 4-day trek. I'm in awe at learning this history.",
          "There's not a huge amount to see at Tambomachay but it's worth doing as part of a visit to all four of the ruins near Cusco. The fact that the water still runs through the site as it did in Incan times is impressive. A bus to Pisac or Calca from Tullumayo (just south of Av",
          "Nice quick stop. I think the most interesting part was listening to our guides theories on what this place was and what the little alcoves were used for. Nothing spectacular but Im glad we made the stop for sure!",
          "This place is special because of the water that comes from the mountains and filter through rocks. It's beautiful.",
          "Of all the sites on this hill covered by the partial Boleto Turistico (the ticket you have to buy to visit certain Inca sites in Cusco), Sacsayhuaman is really the best. Tambomachay is probably the most underwhelming. I was convinced to go on a hike from this site to",
          "At the top of the same hill as Sacsaywaman and can be visited as part of the same journey. Interesting but not the best of the Incan ruins on this hill.",
          "I am glad we caught this on the Sacred valley tour. Kinda of a bottle neck for tourists and not a whole lot to see, so catch this on the fly, but if not no big loss.",
          "It was a pretty uphill walk to see the fountains. There is a tiny market along the way. There is a free bathroom but bring your own toilet paper and wipes for your hands as the sink may not be working. This is included with Boleto Turistico. Glad to say we saw it. I like how",
          "These Inc Ruins have some unique characteristics, such as fountains, baths and guard house. Nice walk and photo ops aplenty.",
          "Was able to see this sight part of my four wheeler and the views were nothing short of amazing. You can really take some absolutely lovely photos of the mountains that sit across from Tambomachay.",
          "As with many other Inca ruins to be visited in this area, it's the impressive yet peaceful setting that creates a wonderful experience. All these sites make for great walking. We admired the precise Inca masonry skills where large rocks are fitted together down to millimeter",
          "We liked seeing the fountains and site at Tambomachay as part of a day trip out of Cusco, but would have have gone to see it on its own",
          "We did our own thing, we took the bus there from the city, walked around the ruins, very peaceful. Great views.",
          "Impressive ruin with fountains and right by Puku Pukara, another site. There were a good lead up to Sacsayhauman and help tell the story of the people.",
          "This small site was an elite/royal resort centered on its springs, which are still flowing through fine Incan masonry. Apparently, these springs are still regarded as having healing properties as we saw a few people laving the water on their infirmities, with a nod from the",
          "Our guide told us about how this was where the royalty bathed and there were pipes that regulated the water so the pressure was the same year round. It's a hike up the hill and it's not a big ruin like some, but the location and history for that part are interesting and it fits",
          "This palce is not as impressive as other local ruins but worth's a visit, although you should be warned that you have to climb at 3800 meters high and that is tiring. Pity you cannot use the water to refresh yourself.",
          "Not for people with a bad physical condition or who are afraid of heights . Interesting and a great view on the town .",
          "A good place to see Incan ruins, however it is much smaller than other sites. From the site itself you get good views over the valley and the site is well maintained.",
          "This place was sort of cool. Not too much to see, if you see a photo you've pretty much seen it all. The location is nice and there's a short walk up to see the baths/fountains. If you're out that way it might be worth it. Its pretty close to Cusco, but I would definitely",
          "I visited all four of the ruins outside Cusco in a half day (Sacsaywaman, Q'enqo, Tombomachay, and Pukapukara). I took a bus to Tambomachay from downtown Cusco and then walked back to Cusco, visiting all four sites along the way. I took the el huerto bus for 1 sole from the",
          "Tambomachay is a small Inca site, but well worth a visit. Stopping in to see the Water Temple will take no more than half an hour. This is a pretty site, it consists of three streams of water spilling into lower basins. The Inca worshipped water, knowing how crucial it was to",
          "In my other reviews, I explained the difference between \u201ctambo\u201d and \u201ctambillo\u201d where a \u201ctambo\u201d is bigger and more of a control point. In this \u201ctambo\u201d, there are series of aqueducts, waterfalls and canals that run through the terraced rocks. There are different types of rocks",
          "This is an interesting ruin with a cool incan water feature. I recommend going without a tour and continuing past the water feature, where you can walk close to the river for a couple of kms and see a few more ruins (not many tourists on the walk). You can also combine",
          "Enjoyed these ruins but could have skipped it in favor of another activity because we had already seen Machu Picchu & Saqsaywaman, which were breathtaking. If you haven't seen enough ruins, it is enjoyable.",
          "We arrived at this site just a few moments before a number of tour buses and as we were walking back to the entrance, the masses came up the path. I recommend visiting this site early in the morning (possibly late in the afternoon too, when the buses are gone\u2026) There\u2019s not",
          "Another example of brilliant Incan engineering and architecture in beautify peaceful surroundings. Also part of the big tourist attraction ticket.",
          "This is one of 4 nearby Incan ruins in close proximity to Cusco and each other. This is small park and with a little bit of walking. Walk slowly to get used to the altitude. Near the entrance are alpacas with locals in native dress. Inside the park people try to hawk native",
          "These ruins are smaller but in excellent shape. The fountains that run through them make the site even more impressive.",
          "Beautifully preserved ruins. Gorgeous scenery and some lovely hikes. Really enjoyed Tambomachay. Get there early before all the tour busses!",
          "Like many of the Inca ruins in Peru, the sights are breathtaking. The hikes seems to be tiring if you're not acclimated to the elevation. These sights charge admission and are regulated by the Peruvian government but real problems are present. Apparently the government is not",
          "these fountains are enormous, this is the first thing that catches your eyes... even if that is a cloudy day this attraction counts for 5, is so big that you can exercise walking around all the complex of underwater canals and bathing pools where the cold water for faraway snow",
          "This archaeological site is associated with the Inca empire and it consists of a series of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls that run through the terrace rocks. It is thought to have possibly been some sort of spa resort for the Inca political elite or possibly another military",
          "So this is a cool experience. I totally recommend going with a guide. The guide gave us a lot of info which is what made this place special.",
          "Make sure you are prepared for plenty of walking and are conditioned for the altitude in Cusco. These ruins are above Cusco City so the height is above 12,000 ft.",
          "Good preview to Machu Picchu, plenty of steps so need to be fit. If you don't have a head for heights the climb is not for you.",
          "We went there as part of the Cusco City tour. It's an interesting place in that the Incas constructed it and the water course that feeds the year round stream of water and no one knows where the water actually comes from. Unfortunately it's the last stop on the tour so there's",
          "This was part of a city tour. The walk up here is nice, along the river. The site is small but it is very interesting.",
          "A lovely site just a few miles outside of Cuzco; ancient fountains which are still functioning. We were told it gets very crowded in the afternoons; fortunately we visited in the morning.",
          "At a spring, the Incas built this interesting stone structure. The water still flows. After a short walk, you will reach the site.",
          "What intrigued me about this place is the spring that never stops flowing. The clincher is that there are no known bodies of water nearby! Warning: the hike up the main structure, though gradual in elevation, robbed me of my breath. Acclimate first before your visit.",
          "This is a relatively small site - compared to say Ollantaytambo - but the water fountains are impressive. As it lies clse to Cuzco it gets very crowded, so go early.",
          "A peaceful Inca site consisting of a series of delicately carved aqueducts, canals, and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks. known as El Bano del Inca, or \u201cThe Bath of the Inca.",
          "Our guide helped us understand the relevance of this site to the Inca's. We used this as our starting point and walked back to Cusco, visiting Puka Pukara, Qinqu Quenqo and Saqsaywaman. The walk was pleasant enough, mostly downhill. It did take over 3 hours.",
          "If you book a city tour you will visit this place. In my opinion, tambomachay is more mysterious and beautiful than sacsayhuaman. Tourist ticket will cover entrance fee. Moderate or less hiking is required.",
          "Had a private 3 hour car and guide. Went here as one of the stops. As with all attractions, it costs to get in, but is interesting to examine. No more than 30 minuets.",
          "Tambomachay is not too for from Cusco so it's any easy drive, cab or bus ride. It's also near Saqsaywaman so it's convenient to see both sites in one trip. Tambomachay was an important stop for the Inca when traveling between Cusco and Machu Picchu as it provided a natural water",
          "Located in a natural area, you arrive at this Inca remains after walking a few hundred meters from the site access. The remains show the characteristic Inca trapezoidal niches, two huge same shrines and an exquisite fountain with running water. The visit to this site is usually",
          "The Bath of the Inca. There are a series of carved aqueducts, canals, and waterfalls that run through the terraced rocks. It is a good idea to bring along a jacket, wear sunscreen and hat.",
          "It's an interesting place to visit. You have to walk a bit to get to the construction site. Try to avoid doing it at midday because the sun it's too strong. Use hats!",
          "Not a lot there. Neat look at the engineering skill of the Incas but then whoop, that's it, time to move on.",
          "Water from underwater source flows just like hundreds and hundreds years ago. You can try to put your head underneath the stream and think of inka gods.",
          "Visit with other 3 sites for 70 soles per person. Small but i like this more than the other 3. I like the water fountains. We went mid may and it was raining. Make Sure you always bring a poncho or jacket. It gets cold too",
          "Tambomachay gives the visitor an excellent insight into how the Incas engineered their water systems. It is a short visit, but it is indeed impressive and if you venture up towards the mountains you will get breathtaking views of the site. Pro Tip: Towards the end of the ruins,",
          "Another nice set of ruins to peak a travelers interest. The water feature of the ruins are the highlight. It is really cool how the Incans engineered their water systems.",
          "Beautiful site a few miles outside Cusco with a ceremonial Inca waterway. Perfect 1/2 day activity as part of the 4 ruins tour of Cusco.",
          "Not a large site, nor too strenuous, the highlight is a central stone structure with waterfalls. Hike up a nearby hill for good views. Nice tree-lined walkway leading to the site.",
          "This place was definitely a challenge! Never had a walked up stairs as tall as this. Perhaps my short height factors in, but still, these stairs were extremely tall. If you're fit or at least have a medium level of fitness, you should be fine. This site is beautiful, though. The",
          "We arrived here at dusk! I t was still amazing. I was able to purchase a fuzzy Alpaca sweater from the vendors.",
          "We stopped at these Incan ruins as part of an all day tour. It was a nice easy stroll to the ruins along a long cobblestone path. It was very pretty. Not very large but I am glad that we stopped to see it.",
          "It's a bit of a hike from the entrance to get to the ruins, especially at altitude! But along the way you pass tourist stalls and the usual ladies with the llamas. There isn't really any walking around involved, the best place to enjoy the site is sitting on the hill opposite",
          "Not as spectacular as some of the Incan sites, but just outside the city proper, in the hills. Usually part of tours that start in Cusco proper and move to the hills for more Incan treasures.",
          "AT 3,800 metres you are gasping for air, however the area is just so beautiful that you forget how high you are. It is amazing that they are still working. Had to laugh there was one spout that had been improved by using a soft drink bottle.",
          "Quick visit to a great example of Inca architecture very close to Cusco. Entrance included in the Boleto Turistico",
          "Not much here but more Inca ruins and a spring. Easy walk up a wide trail to the ruins. Good for a very short excursion. Part of the Inca trail.",
          "If you're already doing a tour or visiting other sites on your own, this is a worthwhile stop and like the other sites, has plenty of history. The walk to the site is not strenuous and it's a quiet, pretty area except for the vendors in one area. The site has aspects that are",
          "Would only go if you are are doing all the other sites nearby. It is cool, but very small and there are lots of other things to see.",
          "Interesting water movement Inco preservation. Even though is ancient water flows well and detail of precise rock cutting and placement persists. Not a big site easy to take in on a short stop.",
          "This lies off the road to Pisac from Cusco. The site is small with good walking tracks and toilets. The site has Inca and Pre inca ruins. Above the main Pre inca ruin is a track that heads right. Estimate 500 m track to Inca ruins that are not advertised. Can see the old water",
          "I blieve everyone should take a picture at there and learn all the history about Tambomachay.. I loved it",
          "This is another part of the Inca civilisation that needs to be seen to really understand their prescience in Cusco",
          "This ruins has a small and nice water flow at the right side of a beautiful stone path. There are ruins with water inka transportation system. Here we really felt the high so walk slowly. You need the Cuzco Pass (130 soles) that you could use in quenco, pukapucara,",
          "We wouldn't have gone here if it wasn't included in our ticket package of the 4 sites (Sacsaywaman, Q'enqo, Pukapukara, Tambomachay). It was interesting, but not as amazing as some of the other sites. The ladies at the front will let you take a picture with you and their llamas",
          "Could be skipped. BY the time you get here, you will have a good idea of how the Incas managed their water system. In fact, to convince you to go, the managers sell it as \"the water of eternal life\" and encourage guests to smear it over their faces. Really a bit over the top.",
          "As with most Incan sites, this one requires a walk up a hill. Trust that the hike will be worth it - this is one of the few Incan sites that has running water. Back in the day the nobility who operated this site charged for the water, which was also deemed sacred.",
          "This Incan site really helped me understand the importance of water and how the people viewed and used it. The irrigation system not only was advanced, but held symbolic purpose to the Inca. I recommend a good guide, who will make learning interesting. We used both a private",
          "Another site that I wish I had skipped to give me more time in Cusco, After a long walk from the parking lot we were greeted by a small site that had a few fountains and some terraces. If you are interested in seeing fountains I would recommend taking a trip to Tipon, which we",
          "This small site is very pretty, situated high up in the foothills of Cusco. A lot of afternoon city tours arrive here around 1pm or later, so getting there in the morning is a good idea.",
          "well, it really is a chain of fountains where the inka chosen women bathed from pure water coming still today from channels cut into the live rock kilometers away from the mountains.",
          "I recommend visiting here with a tour guide to learn all about the Incas. Its amazing to see their water features still working. Beautiful landscape near by with llamas and alpacas running around to take photos with. Might as well visit this place since it is up the road from",
          "Tambomachay is a small place where the incas built part of the fresh water system. It is full of the esoteric game they developed about the opposites, the complementarity and permanent transformation of the material world. A place for worship the basic elements of life.",
          "You'll need a Boleto Turistico to access the site, and it is a bit of a walk in from the parking lot. It's also worth noting that there is a washroom! Tambomachay is the furthest from Cusco, but is just across from Puka Pukara. It's about a 15-20 minute taxi ride from Cusco, and",
          "It is part of the typical City Tour, so u will end up knowing it! It is sort of beautiful in its ruins way! Haha I would do it without a guide because the free time is almost zero, so u can't really enjoy the park!",
          "Fine little site with interesting history that is possible to reach on your own, but in my opinion you should rather visit it (along with four other sites) on a city day tour from Cusco, which are quite cheap. Possible to buy the small boleta turistico only for those sites, but",
          "It's too bad the other reviewer didn't do his homework and expected to be impressed on sight. These sites take a little bit of work, folks, and if you do it, you WILL indeed be impressed. There is not an interpretive center here, nor signs telling you what is what, so either",
          "I did this as part of a City Tour. I had no idea I'd be going up so many stairs at such an incline all day! It was a teensy rush to get everything in a handful of hours, but it was good. Tambomachay is up a ramp, so no stairs necessary. There was choclo, mate de munia, mate",
          "It is good to join this attraction with other surrounding places in the Sacsaywoman area. We did it when having 2hrs horse riding. Place itself very small, no more than 20 min needed. Anyway the stone structure which makes good impression.",
          "This place offers little ruins. The water-fountain is interesting but without any background-informatione (good guide) the whole think entertains your thoughts for 15', not more. Ok for some pictures and if you have time.",
          "Without a guide this site probably has little meaning unless one has done extensive reading on the site. With a good guide, it is a very interesting Inca ruin to visit and learn about another aspect of Inca culture.",
          "a short hike up a well built rock path and got come to this ancient construction. the guide tells the story of its importance as a check point or guards tower area but I think they are completely speculating on that. I wanted to drink the water from the spring but they",
          "My favorite part of this place is the ladies near the parking lot that you can take their photo for a Sol. One of them has her granddaughter with her at times and they have llamas that they are feeding. It is also a good restroom stop between the sacred valley and Cusco",
          "A beautiful, well preserved site from an ancient civilization. It is a beautiful walk to the aqueducts which are still active. It is part of the Cusco tourist card and the locations on the card are all a part of the story of ancient Inca life. Spectacular.",
          "This visit to the ruins was so nice. The weather was perfect and the sites are so beautiful. Our guide enlightened us on how they were built and the true meaning.",
          "very nice place to visit w fountains and wild animals, you can visit the zoo and the inca mountais its a beautiful place",
          "I had purchased the Cusco Tourist Card which included these ruins. I decided to take a taxi up (25 soles from San Blas) and walk down and hit all the ruins along the way. These were very interesting ruins. Its a series of aqueducts and waterfalls. I hiked up behind the",
          "This site is small, but very picturesque and the surrounding countryside is lovely. I'd recommend it as part of a walking tour with Sacsayhuaman, with Puka Punkara and Q'enqo on the way back.",

          "Ruins are a series of aqueducts, canals and waterfalls that run through terraced rocks. This may have been a military outpost, a spa resort, or both. The trees that line the walk near the entrance have benches underneath. I found it to be a peaceful place to rest while watching",
          "Tambomachay, as other tambos was a place of rest for the incas. It is very beautifull, and has a nice water font. Nothing extraordinary, but it is worth the visit if one has the time. Also, it is included in the boleto turistico.",

          "Our tour didn't stay here long but it was worth the visit because of the importance of this site on the Inca trail. The masonary work of the Incas is impressive",
          "This site was popularly known as the \"Inca's baths\". This site shows the Inca's architectural talents and their vast knowledge of hydraulics. This site is small, so if you are pressed for time, it's not worth the stop. However, if you're not, take the time to check it out.",
          "We visited this site as part of a broader tour of the surrounding Inca ruins near Cusco. Tambomachay is an interesting site and is worthy of visiting, but only if combined with some of the other nearby sites. It's not a destination I would consider worthy of its own intentional",
          "Interesting short visit, combine it with other nearby sites as its included in the 'tourist boletto' and a taxi for half day for this and the opposite Pukapukara and nearby more impressive Sacsayhuaman is then a worthwhile good half day. Otherwise in itself its quite interesting",

          "This was a neat site of ancient purification and is impressive, but pales in comparison to some of the other ruins around Cusco. Plus, it is quite a walk (not because of distance but because of the altitude. It also didn't help that our 2PM city tour did this one last and we",

          "You thought Cusco was high. This place is over 12600 feet. The gentle incline is tough if you aren't used to the altitude. When you get there it is interesting but not nearly as interesting as the other sites near Cusco. I think this is added to the tour to stretch it to 4",
          "This was the final stop on my day tour. The entrance where the bus left us was small. You need to walk/hike all the way up to the top to see the fountains. It felt like a 20 minutes hike, it was dark and really cold. On the way up there is more people selling alpaca products.",

          "I had been here many years ago and my guide wasn't too keen on taking me there but boy was he wrong! this is a very special site with soothing fountains. You can no longer touch the water but it's still really impressive, just a short hike to get there. Don't miss it!",
          "You have to walk up a hill to get there. A guide should make the tour more interesting, but would be boring without one. There is nothing more than what you can see in the pictures.",
          "Bit like alfie50 - not worth the effort. Eventually, ruins are like cathedrals in Europe and Red Forts in India, you can overdose on the, We had already seen so many and this didn't add to the experience. What did make if fascinating was watching 2 Llamas fighting, at first I",

          "We have visited this site on our way travelling from Urubamba to Cusco combined with other attractions in the area such as the Animal Sanctuary Cochahuasi, Puca Pucara and Sacsayhuaman. It's a good stop if you are in the neighborhood and it's included in Boleto Turistico.",
          "Neat place to stop while seeing the other sites, maybe not for just that but if you are in the area it is worth stopping.",
          "This was the last stop on our bus trip, it was getting dark so we were a bit rushed. There is some neat stone work to be seen here and a major water fountain. We were told that the water always flows here, even when they haven't had rain in a long period of time.",

          "We visited this site as part of a day tour from Cusco. Interesting place and definitely worth a visit when in Cusco. A nice short slightly inclined walk to the ruins. The site is a bit higher altitude than Cusco and a stroll through it helped with acclimitization to the",

          "It was getting dark by the time we got there and we still had one place to see so we felt rushed. I wanted to see more flowers and birds but it was late. The ruins were small. They were ancient baths. I had fun talking with the vendors of shawls and blankets and ended up",
          "This is one of the smallest sites around Cusco, and a little disappointing as it doesn't offer much in terms of ruins. The good unique thing about this site is the still functioning irrigation channels and waterways, interesting to see how the Inca commanded the water through",

          "Who days small can not be beautiful. I never get tired of the inca stone work, whether large or small. This is lovely small site that adds to our knowledge of the Inca. The stone work is, as usual, beautiful. I guess what I like best was the simplicity of the structure and",
          "A ceremonial site not far from Sacsayhuaman, takes you on a pastoral walk of about 1/2 mile. Once again, the Incas show the world how they mastered the fountains and waters of the Andes with this structure",

          "The site only has one main area with a nicely carved wall and some trickling fountains. It's a pleasant spot to walk around for a bit. Go if you have the tourist ticket and are planning on visiting a bunch of sites, otherwise it's probably not worth the entry fee. A great trip",
          "This is just a small attraction at the end of a very nice walk through some nice countryside. There are water fountains built by the Inca and the water goes underground to the Temple of the Sun.",
          "Part of the city tour so worth the short walk to see it. It is a site with acquaducts and basins for bathing of the Incans. A bit different and small, but still interesting.",
          "If you are very keen on Inca sites, then visit this place. If you have see other sites, then this is really a very small and not particularly impressive one. I enjoyed it, but I would go out of my way to see it again.",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "It started to rain so this was a perfect museum to go inside for about an hour. I liked it a lot because it helped to learn the history and culture importance of the coca leaf. The second floor is very good and a little comical at times. As in all museums in Peru the displays",
          "Humble but cute, this place is a great way to spend an hour or so ducking away from the frequent Cusco rainstorms. We had a great tour guide, sampled some Coca leaves, and learned lots about the cocaine process (in a very mature and respectful way). Highly recommended!",

It\u2019s a neat little museum that provides a nice look at the history of coca and its cultural impact.",
          "The Museo de Coca is well worth the time and (low) cost. The guides are very knowledgeable and the information is well researched. The only part we did not like was the display with a drug addict overdose. I do understand they are differentiating to say that coca leaf has many",

Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "It is good to visit this after you take a guided city tour, so you can put some images to the info you got and understand more. There are not many exhibits. We were without a guide, so I was not impressed",
          "Was part of my tourist ticket, so I was able to go and check it out for free.. Housed in a former hacienda, this museum presents the history of the region back to the dinosaur times up to revolutionary times with items from each time period. Goes into depth on several",
          "The first floor is good ancient regional history. The second floor is all Spanish influence and native resistance. An enjoyable afternoon.",
          "This museum while small gives you a different view of Peru throughout the ages from pre Inca to post colonisation. The exhibits are well labelled in both Spanish & English however the english labelling drops off towards the final exhibits. Gives an interesting overview of",
          "Visited this on a whim, as it was one of the sites included in the Boleto Turistico del Cusco (130 soles allows you to visit 14 ruins/sites around Cusco). It was worth the visit and one of the better museums in Cusco.",
          "Our guide Johann (for Condor Travel) led our tour group through this museum and offered explanations of how the Inca building work survived Cusco's earthquakes but the later construction by the Spanish during the 300 year long colonial period did not. An eye opener for sure!",
          "The first time that I visited this museum (several years ago) it was mainly just paintings, since then they have remodeled and have added some nice displays and artifacts. In the past I have advised our guests to skip this museum, but will now have to start recommending a visit.",
          "If you have the general tourist ticket and its still valid then entry to this museum is included. This is one of the few good museums around Cusco and brings to light the progressive pre and Incan history very well. The museum spreads over two floors and is well curated. As you",
          "Visited this place as had the tourist ticket. Some pieces were lovely and very educational with lovely displays at the ground level. However it didn't seem to transmit to some of the rooms on the first floor. It closes at 1700 so I recommend visiting if you are acclimating and",
          "What i like it is that the Museum offered us a Tour Guide with no cost. She was extraordinary and provided so much detail and information. Ask for that when you visit the Museum. It is a small museum with lot of info.",
          "This museum is part of the Tourist Ticket that includes several attractions from Ollantaytambo to sites closer to and within Cusco as well. I enjoyed the artifacts and the descriptions were interesting and informative. Unless American museums, it's quite small so it's easy",
          "This museum goes through TWO stories. Saw lot of people leaving without realising that. First floor had everything from fossils to inka culture, clothing, agriculture, food, jewelery, ceremonial items. Worth seeing. Second floor had Spanish invasion theme. The house used to",
          "Since the museum was included as part of the Boleto Turistico del Cusco, we stopped by during a long walk and had a quick visit. There were several exhibits across the two floors on the history of the region from early geological times through Spanish colonization. A number of",
          "I very much enjoyed this museum which is part of the boleto turistico. It is the perfect size and had a diversity of interesting exhibits. I was especially intrigued by Garcilaso de la Vega and the pre-Incan history.",
          "The museum is one of the oldiest in the city, and it's very expensive. But it has two floors, one totally dedicated to the pre-columbian cultures, and the second one totally dedicated to spanish things done in Per\u00fa, but without any connections in between them. I didn't find a \"",
          "I tried to buy a ticket to visit the museum at the front door, but I was informed that they did not sell tickets there. I was told I would have to purchase a \"package tour\" ticket, which included about a dozen other sites that I had already visited on previous visits to Cusvo.",
          "Fair disclosure: I am a total history nerd, so museums like this appeal to me, but even I recognize that often \"regional\" museums can suffer from low funding or slim collections, and are not high on most tourists' lists. Nothing could be further from the truth here--this was a",
          "I was surprised with this museum. I had few expectations. When I went, I found that the museum gave a great, thorough and interesting summary of the history Cusco. A great introduction to Cusco!",
          "Very fine museum with a fun self guided experience. Take pics if you can, must see the far corners of this valuable collection inside a museum of artifacts...",
          "This Museum is about the early Spanish colonisation in a historical house, where you can understand some key elements of the Spanish colonisation of Cusco and the consequences that it took. Not very pleasant if you are Spanish but nevertheless interesting piece of history with a",
          "Not too in depth, but a great history from geological times through Spanish Colonization. Some good historical facts and an inteesting collection. It's part of your Tourist Ticket, so might as well visit if you've time.",
          "This small museum gives one insight into the geography, architecture, history, politics of the entire area. It includes the prehistoric (with bones) to the Spanish destruction of the native Incas. There is something here for everyone and it is even a good place for children.",
          "worth the visit - Learned about de le Vega and Tupak Amaru II. Some dinosaur bones and recreation right off the bat, some religous and some local farming tools. Something for everyone. you probably only need a hour. It closed earlier than the internet said it would.",
          "We first visited the Museo de Arte Precolombino, then the Museo Inka, then Museo Machu Picchu and finally this museum. This one was by a long way the least interesting. It does not have a lot of exhibits and those that it has largely duplicate what is on display elsewhere. I",
          "This museum is interesting since it gives shows you the historical advancement of the region (from prehisorical to the Incas to the Spanish invasion). I particularly liked the part on the Incas-Spanish relationship and to see how everything happened. The museum is quit short",
          "This museum is on the Boleto Turistico, so we decided to see it our last day. It has some pre-Inca artifacts, Inka history, and then Spanish art. It's worth seeing if you have an extra hour or so.",
          "We went there without any spectatives and it was a nice surprise. We joined a guided tour which turned to be really interesting. The guide explained every topic in a way that could be easily understood and caught our attention from the begining to the end",
          "We ducked in here to escape the rain and wound up staying for a worthwhile visit. If you want to understand the various cultures that have inhabited Peru over the years, this is a good place to start. Well laid out and cheap.",
          "Got there a little after 4 and they close promptly at 5. Was not able to see it in its entirety, but loved what I did see",
          "It's not the biggest museum ever. Didn't took us longer then an hour. Had couple nice exhibits about Incas and pre incas tribes that used to live around Cusco. There was a big exhibit on Tupac Amaru II life and execution which I found very interesting.",
          "Spent about an hour on a self-guided tour of this museum during my trip to Cusco. I wouldn't seek it out, but we had a free pass to it, so we thought we'd check it out. Some nice artifacts here. Definitely worth a free trip, but I probably wouldn't pay to visit.",
          "The first floor offers helpful and well-designed exhibits on pre-Columbian artifacts. The second floor focuses more on Colonialism.",
          "Slipped by here a one of the museums on the Tourist ticket package, It is a very neat building and nice displays, smaller, but worthy of a visit, especially if it is hot or rainy!",
          "Headquartered small museum inside the history of the country and the city. Missing in an English speaking guide who will help tourists.",
          "Nice tour to know more about the history of Peru and the process of colonization (part of the tourist ticket)",
          "It is a nice museum and since entry was included on our Boleto Turistico, we popped in and did not regret it. Some very good displays and artifacts. They also explain more about the 'Last Inca', Tupac Amaru II ; interesting aspect of the cruel Spanish suppression of the Indian",
          "May not have gone if it wasn't on the tourist ticket. Found the painting of the last supper funny as Jesus was eating guinea-pig in true Peruvian style. Nice collection of artefacts such as pots and impressive tiny figures made out of stone or metal.",
          "Be sure to include the museo on your list of places to see in Cusco/Sacred Valley because all the info helps tie everything together. It was included in our 10-day Tourist Ticket.",
          "The museum is right on the picturesque Plaza of Regocijo, right across from the Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art. Both are included in the Boleto Turistico price valid for 10 days. Plan a visit to the square for both the museums as they are both small and easy to cover in a",
          "Included in the tourist ticket, this is a very nice museum, it would be 1 hour well spent, guidance is included and you learn a lot about Cusco, the Incas, the colonial times, a little bit about gastronomy. In addition to that, this was the house of the Inca Garcilaso de la",
          "As part of the combined tourist ticket it's worth popping into this museum but it doesn't really tell you anything you can't find out at better museums (eg Museo Larco in Lima). Some nice paintings and an exhibit on the 'Last Inca', Tupac Amaru II, including a hilarious video",
          "This well-equipped museum provides a great collection of objects and information on the history of Peruvian cultures. Regional here is meant in a wider perspective, not only focused on Peru but also surrounding countries. Highly recommended",
          "It does some have Incan artifacts, but most are not dated so there is no context in history. Their map of Peru completely leaves out the non-Incan cultures in Northern Peru. The bulk of the museum is about the Spanish. After seeing the great museums around Peru, I would only",
          "This museum won't blow you away but can give you a basic understanding of the major historical events of Cusco. Prehistoric->Wari->Inca->Spanish->Current. It distinctly has a pro-Incan bend which is expected. Some decent artifacts but nothing like Larco in Lima. It really only",
          "This is one of the best museums in Peru in my opinion, only takes a couple of hours to go through, is in the middle of Cusco and all exhibits have English explanations. Gives a great overview of the regions history, definitely worth going (and we went to 12 of the 16 turistica",
          "Interesting collection to give one a quick overview of the different era's for Cuzco's history. It really helps understanding the Inca culture a little better",
          "We visited this museum as it was included in the Boleto Turistico and we had some time to spare. We had to sign in and show our passports to enter. There is security staff everywhere, making sure no one takes a sneaky photo of anything\u2026 It was well worth the visit and",
          "We visited this museum as it was part of Boleta General Turistica which were about to expire. What can I say - nice building, nice courtyard, limited number of exhibition rooms covering regional history of Cusco. Some interesting artifacts, lots of ceramics, some religious",
          "A fun museum to show local Inka history with some basic artifacts, paintings, models, etc. However no photography allowed for some inexplicable reason.",
          "Really astonished about this museum. A well choosen collection, free guidance and superb explanation in all of their rooms.",
          "This was included in our Turistico boletto we purchased for our time in the Sacred Valley, so we decided to check it out since we were in Cusco for 3 days. We enjoyed our time there and spent about 1.5hrs total walking through the displays.",
          "The building is attractive, and the directions guide you through chronological time periods. My favorite part of the museum was the case of mummies at the end.",
          "Housed in the actual residence of Inca descendant, Garcilaso de la Vega, this museum is small but presents history and relics in a simple yet very interesting manner. The museum is part of the boleto turistico you or your guide bought to get into most of the tourist sights",
          "We went along as it was part of the Boleto Touristico de Cusco. A few of the exhibits were good but overall it was just another museum.",
          "Certainly the best that I visited! Many artifacts, pieces of art, and information very well-presented. Comprehensive narrative of the region from pre-history to modern times. The room devoted to the brutal end of Tupac Amaru II was particularly affecting. Entry with the tourist",
          "We had the tourist pass that give entry to a number of museums and historical sites in Cusco. We had heard that this is one of the better museums. It is worth a visit.",
          "There are a lot of paintings that explain the history of cusco as well as inka empire. Also, invasion of spanish is very well recorded and displayed. Entrance fee is covered by tourist ticket.",
          "Great museum with many artifacts that will help you understand the life of the Incas. You will see the different styles of pottery of the Incas and much much more. Highly recommend.",
          "Worth a visit for a little history lesson. The building is lovely and the displays were well presented.",
          "We thought that this was the best museum to visit. Note that you need to have a ticket already (from tourist agency) that covers other museums and archeological sites, you can't buy a ticket at the museum its self. Large display of relics, paintings, dvd's in some rooms",
          "We stopped by this small museum because it was on our tourist pass. We enjoyed some of the pottery and art. We stayed for about 15 minutes, which was enough to enjoy the museum. Our favorite part was on the second floor, it was a display of guinea pigs being cooked in an oven.",
          "i really liked to visit this museum so i can learn and understand more of the inka world & times, its like going back on time.",
          "I'm not much of a museum person but I love Archaeology and this museum had a good amount of it. I had no idea that they found these artifacts and bones in Cusco and the surrounding areas. Very interesting. It's a two story, nice building, with a courtyard. it ends with paintings",
          "The ticket was included in a tour package purchased to tour the ruins on the outside of the city. It was interesting and l learned alot, but not worth the time and money if you are not planning to spend alot of time in Cusco.",
          "The tourist ticket gives you admission to this museum. It has dusty old displays and too many rooms of \"churchy\" stuff. I would have been very disappointed had I paid outright for this museum but since it was included in the tourist ticket I felt OK for leaving after a short",
          "A great museum covering pre-inca. Inca, and Colonial Periods. Art, Exhibits and excellent presentation. I liked the colonial art and exhibitions on inca culture.",
          "To be honest, I'm not a museum lover at all. This was a small museum, which I found minimally interesting. We used our boleto turistico to enter, and were in and out within 10-15 minutes.",
          "Highly recommend this museum for all tourists to Cusco, not for the pre-Columbian Inca exhibits but for the excellent post 1600 exhibit halls on Tupac Amaru ll and the Inca Garciloso. In contrast to the complementary, extensive, but dated Cusco Inca Museum, this is a focused",
          "A quite small but interesting museum which gives you a better understanding of cusco and the cultures around.",
          "This museum is the best one in Cusco, offers a huge range of many exhibits, from prehistoric fossils, ancient Inca pottery found in sites. On the 2nd floor are paintings and wood carvings in pristine condition from the 17th-18th century, the Virgin Mary portrait is extremely",
          "We really enjoyed this museum which offered plenty of information on the area. Well laid-out and a good way to spend a few hours.",
          "Very interesting collection of art here, lots to see and it's in a cool builing and easy walkable location for toe city square.",
          "I had a few minutes to stop in this museum and was trying to rush around it. There were a couple of curators who were literally blocking me from going into some rooms before I had been in others. I appreciate that the rooms followed sequentially but I didn't want to see all of",
          "This museum is part of the boleto turistico, so don't miss out. It's the perfect amount of time to get some insights into the life of the Incas after the Spanish took control. It outlines the protests, the new ways of life imposed by the Spanish and the struggle to fight off the",
          "I visited this museum with a group of my students. We read about Inca Garcilaso de la Vega in class but the best way was to bring him back by visiting the house where he grow up. The word became alive and meaningful. One of the ladies/guards was so sweet to take her time and",
          "We wanted to do a museum in Cuzco and after reading reviews on TripAdvisor we decided that the Regional History Museum was the one that we needed to go to. Good choice. First of all, this museum is on the Boleto Turistic\u00f3, so if you buy that, it is definitely worth a stop. I",
          "Great pictorial of history in both Spanish. And English very informative and also about the life of the Inca pre an post Spanish. Which we enjoyed as so much is about the Ruins in this area. It explained every day life. Also there is an interesting chart about how other cultures",
          "Pretty good museum, had a lot in it. I wouldn't have necessarily gone if it wasn't included with the Cusco Tourism pass. If you have some free time it's worth a short stop.",
          "If you have the tourist card then worth a visit. Go afterwards to the chocolate museum in the same plaza. The ground floor is the best bit all about the incas. The first floor is a bit dull.",
          "In Cusco, only the Pre-Columbian Art Museum is better, but unlike the Pre-Columbian Museum, the Museo Historico Regional is included in the Boleto Turistico. If I had only two days in Cusco, I would not rush here but we spent an hour to an hour and a half here on a rainy",
          "If you bought a full Boleto Turistico, this museum is included in the entrance fee. The Museum covered regional history, though not in great detail and with large gaps, as it is a smaller museum. The earlier history was done from a historic prospective, but then the colonial",
          "Learn something about the region. It is included in Cusco tourist ticket. I share two pictures with you.",
          "Personally I loved this museum a lot. Don't get me wrong. It is not an outstanding collection of art and cannot be compared to museums you might have visited accross Europe or the States. It is completely different and you might be suprised by some items that might reminds you",
          "The Regional Museum was another recommendation from our guide (over and above some of the other museums in Cusco) and, given that it's included on the Cusco tourist ticket, is worth a look if you're spending two or three days in Cusco and have already seen the \"top tier\" sights",
          "This small museum gives you a nice overview of the history of the Cuzco area. If you have time before heading into the Sacred Valley stop here and take a tour. It is a nice lead in to what you will see.",
          "went to at least 5 museums while in Cusco,a nd found this the best. was very informative, had a great mix of exhibits/artifacts/art/textiles etc. Was the perfect size to enjoy what a museum is all about, learning and enjoying, and this allowed both. Was very impressed, and am",
          "Told the history of the region through art. It was interesting and intimate. I enjoyed this small but informative museum. Takes just an hour or two. It has clean bsthrooms.",
          "This museum isn't particularly outstanding, but compared to other museums in Cusco its very nice. Admission is included on the tourist ticket.",
          "This charming local museum really tries to encompass all of local history by including a single room on pre-human details of this area. It then goes into sequential details about the various cultures that have inhabited this area. I might not have bothered had this not been on",
          "It\u2019s on the Boleta Touristica and it\u2019s close to Plaza de Aramas, so you may as well go in. They have some interesting pre Inka pottery, and some really gruesome paintings showing how the Spanish conquistadors treated the Indian Incas. If you don\u2019t have the Boleta Touristica I",
          "I actually visited the Unsaac Museo Inka which is not listed on trip advisor I actually stumbled across this museum whilst looking for a restraunt .Curiosity got the better of me so I paid the princely sum of 10 soles ( about $5 ) and I was not disappointed Artefacts and",
          "This museum looks bigger than it is, and the title suggests that it is more comprehensive than it is. There are no exhibits on the first floor at all, and since the large, interior courtyard takes up so much space there are really only about 7 or 8 rooms to see (on the second",
          "Not a great Cusco attraction, but contains a fairly decent selection of Inca, per-Inca and Colonial artefacts. To be honest the range and variety at the Inka Museum is better, but it's a pleasant old house and the staff make an effort by dressing up in traditional clothes. I",
          "This is a nice little museum to spend 30-40 minutes strolling around. I went as it was included in the Boleto Touristico, not sure how much it is separately. It has some interesting info on the history of the Inca's along with some Inca artefacts. Annoying, though I've noticed",
          "Of the minor museums covered by the Boleto Turistico, this is probably the best. It should take you about a half hour or 45 minutes to tour the museum. The museum covers interesting tale of how the history of the Incas and Peru was documented. Some wonderful period clothing",
          "The museum isn't very big, but it is included in the Bollesta Touristica, so I went. Easy to find, close to the main Plaza....but only takes about 30 minutes to see it all....",
          "Entrance to this museum is included in the Boleto Touristico, so if you're walking by and have already purchased your ticket, then it's worth a look. It doesn't take long to go through. If you've been in a number of museums, then you've probably already seen much of what's in",
          "Not as popular as some of the other sites in Cusco centre, but we really enjoyed strolling through at a leisurely pace. It was full of interesting things and provided an inviting environment for visitors. Although we traveled as a couple, I think this place might have enough to",
          "Living history in Cusco. Although not extensive, the museum provides a good overview of the Inca Empire before the conquest.",
          "Actually located in the house of Garcilaso de la Vega, this museum was particularly interesting in the information it gave about the man who has provided so much information about the Inka civilisation and culture. The exhibits on food and cooking were also particularly",
          "My first stop on the Cusco city tour was Qorikancha, and Inca ruin with a Spanish cathedral built on top of it. Ernesto, my outstanding guide, used this stop to educate me on the Inca building techniques and prepare me for other sites I would see at Cusco, in the Sacred Valley,",
          "This small musuem near the Church/Convent of La Merced is worth a stop. Purchase a boleto Turistico which covers several sites and museums. The collection includes some wonderful colonial religious art. The building is also interesting."

        "wiki": "Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [\u02c8k\u027eistu \u0281eden\u02c8to\u0281], local pronunciation: [\u02c8k\u027ei\u0255t\u016d\u033b xe\u031eden\u02c8to\u0266]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca Forest National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A symbol of Christianity across the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nVincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid 1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and due to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento (\"Monument Week\") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as 'Godlessness' in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the \"Statue of the Christ\" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen.\nLocal engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy.A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931 and cost the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2019) and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on-site.In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Archbishop of Rio, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint\u2014Our Lady of the Apparition, under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again, on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act \"a crime against the nation\". The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo's usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the statue while in an Inter Milan strip. The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\n\nIn 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo, oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro entered an agreement to conduct restoration work.\nMore work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010 focused on the statue itself. The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.The restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue.  During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.Maintenance work needs to be conducted periodically due to the strong winds and erosion to which the statue is exposed, as well as lightning strikes. The original pale stone is no longer available in sufficient quantity, and replacement stones are increasingly darker in hue.\n\n\n== Similar structures ==\nChrist the Redeemer in Rio Verde, Goi\u00e1s, Brazil\nChrist in the Mount in Pitangui, Minas Gerais, Brazil\nCristo del Otero in Palencia, Spain built in 1930 (21 m)\nCristo Rey (statue, Mexico) located on the Cerro del Cubilete in Guanajuato, Mexico, inspired by Rio's Christ the Redeemer (23 m)\nCristo Rey in Tenancingo, M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico (30 m)\nChrist Blessing in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (30 m)\nChrist of Havana in Havana, Cuba, inspired by Christ the Redeemer (20 m)\nChrist of the Abyss in various underwater locations\nChrist of the Ozarks in Arkansas, United States, inspired by Rio's Christ the Redeemer (20 m)\nChrist of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u in Vietnam (32 m)\nChrist the King in \u015awiebodzin, Poland (33 m)\nChrist the Redeemer of the Andes (Argentina/Chile)\nChrist the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Ibiza, Spain, inspired by Christ the Redeemer (23 m)\nCristo Blanco in Cusco, Peru\nCristo de la Concordia in Cochabamba, Bolivia (34 m)\nCristo de las Noas in Torre\u00f3n, Mexico (22 m)\nCristo del Pac\u00edfico in Lima, Peru, erected in 2011 (37 m)\nPatung Yesus Kristus in Mansinam Island, West Papua, Indonesia (30 m)\nCristo Redentore (Christ the Redeemer) of Maratea, Italy (21 m)\nCristo Rei (Christ the King) in Almada, Portugal (28 m)\nCristo Rei of Dili in Dili, Timor-Leste (27 m)\nCristo Rei, Madeira on Madeira island, completed in 1927 (15 m)\nCristo Rei in Lubango, Angola (14 m)\nStatue of Cristo Luz in Balne\u00e1rio Cambori\u00fa, Santa Catarina, Brazil\nStatue of Jesus Christ on the top of Sagrat Cor, Barcelona, Spain\nTas-Salvatur, Malta (12 m)\nStatue of Jesus Christ, Monte Urgull, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain - 12 m\nJesus de Greatest in Imo, Nigeria, Africa's tallest statue of Jesus and fifth tallest statue on the continent (8.53 m)\nCristo del Picacho in Tegucigalpa, Honduras\nCristo Redentor, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic\nChrist The King Lebanon\nAnother imitation statue of Christ the Redeemer is at Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India.(Shrish Patil)\nimitation at Kovalam, near Trivandrum, Kerala, India.\nImitation at Ecopark, Kolkata, India.\nChrist the Redeemer of Malacca is on the Portuguese Settlement Square in Melaka, Malaysia (20' tall)\nCristo Rey in Colombia (26 m)\nCristo Rey by Urbici Soler in Sunland Park, New Mexico - (8.83 M)\nCristo Redentor (Barranca province, Lima, Peru)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of statues by height\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlanes, Ruy Llera (2014). \"Review: Giumbelli, Emerson (2014), S\u00edmbolos Religiosos em Controv\u00e9rsia.

          "Perched high above the colonial center of Cusco, is Cristo Blanco a large statue of Jesus Christ that can be seen across the city. Towering some 8 meters (26 feet) high the white structure was a gift from Arabic Palestinians who sought refuge in Cusco after World War II. The",
          "The view of the statue in bright morning dawns light was SPECTACULAR for me. The walk from city center was an endurance test of ALTITUDE AND ELEVATION. Yes, I survived!",
          "Visited this statue at dusk and was a great view from there of Cusco. Amazing how they have made these statues in so many places.",
          "I had a clear view of statue from Sacsayhuaman while I was doing the city tour. You can catch a city tour bus in Cusco or taxi to get a closer look. My lens was able to get the perfect shot from Sacsayhuaman, so I didn't bother going to see it up close. Sacsayhuaman is part of",
          "While not as big and impressive as the Rio deJaneiro more famous cousin, it still quite interesting specially when lighted at night and if you go up to visit Sacsayaman Inca site, it is nearby and it offers great views to the city",
          "Near to \"sexy women\". in the field below, locals are cooking potatoes in clay make-shift ovens. They build them, start a fire, put in the potatoes and then break the oven down on the spuds. in 45 minutes it is lunch time.",
          "On top of a beautiful view, this statue of Christ has a particularly interesting history. I recommend taking a bus from Wanchaq, as it's a beautiful and bumpy ride! The location is convenient; it is right next to Sacsayhuaman.",
          "You can see the large lit up Christ from the square in Cusco looking over the city. Visiting it close up does not add anything, it looks better from the town.",
          "I don't know if I would drive here specifically to see this. There isn't much to do here but the views from here are pretty cool looking out over the city.",
          "Too many people too touristy and difficult to get a shot without wire fencing - go to Brazil to see This was ajrequested stop so great that we can add to city tour",
          "Ok, so it\u2019s not quite Rio, but it\u2019s still a nice place to head up to for views over the city, particularly if you\u2019re also coming to Sacsayhuaman",
          "This is a large Christ statue high up in the hills overlooking Cusco. You get great views from here. You'll find loitering locals in costume with LLamas who will let you take a photo of them for a tiny fee, so why not. Take your time walking up to the monument - you're at",
          "Not really very inspiring or monumental. Part of our Cusco City Tour which stopped at various ruins. Your aren't missing much if you don't see it.",
          "The statue and three crosses require a short climb. Expect encounter vendors selling trinkets and a mother with either small children or a llama wanting to charge you to take a picture. Overall, this si how they make thier living, so be kind end endulge them.",
          "We teally enjoyed visiting the white Christ statue. We learned about the history behind it and the view of the city down below is amazing! Definitely worth seeing!",
          "Our G Adventures guide brought us here and I'm so glad he did because I would have never known about this place and it was an amazing place to see Cusco from above. We stayed here for about 20 minutes and I got to take some of my favourite pictures from the trip. To be able to",
          "I had not included this in my trip. However, due to the problematic \" public transport \" option of the Animal Sanctuary, I ended up here. The statue itself, well, is average. Nothing special. The view of Cusco, is spectacular. If you are going to Sacsayhuaman in a private",
          "You do not have to go to the statue to see it. It can be seen and photographed with a good camera from Saqsawaman which is a to see site. The statue is impressive and is very close to the Saqsawaman site therefore you can go to it without spending a lot of time. Since you are",
          "Nice overview of city that helps orient you and give you the view of the plazas from the statue you see from the plazas!",
          "Good hike up steep road or steps to get ready for trail. We did this and Saksaywaman on same day to build up some lungs but felt both sites were nothing spectacular compared to other places to visit in region. Would not visit unless your not intending on going to other sites",
          "This attraction is very close to Saksaywaman. At the top, it offers best panoramic view of Cusco. The section to the top is not paved way. There was quite a lot of tourist during our time of visit",
          "There's no good excuse NOT to see this while you're in the area. Which you will be since Sacsayhuaman is right there. But definitely not worth an independent trip.",
          "Looks better at a distance. There's not a lot to this attraction. Giant statue of Jesus. This is however a spectacular viewpoint overlooking Cusco. Great spot for a panoramic picture of the city and the mountains behind.",
          "A cool little piece history, with a great view of the city. The monument sits on a promontory above the city, and there are often vendors selling tourist trinkets around, and the site can be reached by foot from the city (a pretty good 45 minute hike), or by taxi (a ten minute",
          "This statue sits high on a hill behind the Monasterio Hotel. Our guide told us it was a gift from non-Christian groups in the City of Cusco. It is much smaller than the Christ Statue in Rio but still beautiful.",
          "This is a must see while in Cusco. I would not recommend hiking to it. Easy to take a taxi. But make sure your taxi is round trip. Hard to find a taxi up there. The view of Cusco City is AWESOME!",
          "When you land in Cusco with that altitude buzz in your head, grab a few glasses of warm water with coca leaves and start walking slowly up the stairs to meet christ on the hill. The 6-8 km will test your cardiopulmonary fitness and get you prepared for your expedition!",
          "While this is a notable statue of the Cusco area, it seems less impressive up close than from a distance. I would say that, if you are taking a ride on the Panoramic Tourist Bus, as we did, and you visit this statue as one of the many \"drive-bys\", then it is Ok to get out and",
          "If you get a chance, go to the top of the mountain and enjoy the statute and view from the base of the statute.",
          "You can find these statues in almost every major town, they have a very long and interesting history on the changes to their religious practices. Well worth the visit",
          "History lessen. The statue was a gift given to the town of Cusco by Palestinians who had found refuge there.",
          "We enjoyed the site. It is very busy so do not expect quite time here unless you come very early or late in the day. The view is exciting. You can get many nice images from the site.",
          "We visited the statue of Christ early one morning and it was very quiet. The statue is white and although fairly large, it is no where near the size of Christ the Redeemer in Rio. It was presented to the People of Cusco by the Palestinians in 1943, 5 years before the creation",
          "Giant white statue of Christ that is on a hilltop overlooking Cusco. You can drive to the base, but then there is a walk to get to the statue.",
          "worth the walk and awesome pictures, great view of the city, better than visiting sacsayhuaman close by",
          "My wife and I were here on a Globus tour and this was just a 10-minute stop, from Sacsayhuaman before heading back to Cusco city for the evening. It's nice, but wouldn't really say this was great, aside from the views of the city. The Statue of the White Christ, as it's",
          "This statue is not very tall but can been seen from the centre of Cusco. On the hill beside it are another three crosses. I would not go there just to see the Cross.",
          "So we had the best view of Machupicchu from this place we took amazing picture, and of course you can buy very cheap handycraf around this place",
          "If you have morning free,you should definitely came for a nice walk. The site itself is really small and you will be done in 10min but it's still worth to go there for a nice city view.",
          "This is part of the city tour and it has such interesting history behind it. Definitely go because you can see all of Cusco from this location.",
          "I think you don't need must go up there! that very small and not nice. just see in plaza de armas.",
          "The statue from far away looks so massive, we were expecting more, but when we actually got to the top of the mountain it was a lot smaller than we expected. Lots of tourists and can be very crowded at times so make sure you have a guide that knows the best times to go and knows",
          "Cristo Blanco overlooks the city of Cusco. Excellent view of the city. Lots of opportunities to buy souvenirs. Doesn't take long to visit. Easy walk from the parking lot.",
          "This was just an okay spot to see. Since it is not that old it was not that interesting. There were tons of locals there when we went and lots o families flying kites",
          "The statue is located on top of a hill, it is a nice quiet spot, we spotted a few locals and alpacas roaming about. It is good spot to see the entire Cusco valley.",
          "I walked up early to avoid the crowds. It is well worth the effort. The climb is not difficult, but the statue is very impressive and the view of Cusco is beautiful.",
          "Kool but dont go there on purpose...go have a look t it if you go visit the beautifull archeological site of Sacsayhuaman",
          "Not worth up a separate hike, but easy to do when visiting Saksaywaman. The statue is not that imposing, and near a main bus stop for touring buses.",
          "A smaller version of the statue of Christ in Rio de Janiero. Very cool to see. Scenic views abound here.",
          "After exploring the Sacsayhuaman site, we walked to the White Cristo nearby. From the statue, the view of the city of Cusco below is unsurpassed! Definitely worth visiting both these sites.",
          "A nice addition to a visit to sacsayhuaman ruins but by no means essential. Its just another statue of Jesus in South America and one that is quite underwhelming in terms of stature. The views from here and the surrounding area are lovely as they look over Cusco city (which is",
          "On the very top of the hills above Cusco we found this enormous statue of Christ looking down into the Valley. We visited the statue during our tour of Sacsayhuaman",
          "We hiked up from Plaza de Armes which was a great way to see the city, some of Sacsayhuaman (need your pass to get in the gate...or take a cab for a few sol which is what three of us did as we were getting tired from the climb), and the surrounding views.",
          "If you're in the area, on a bus tour or visiting nearby attractions it's as good a place as any I suppose. Not really my scene though, thronged with pushy tourists elbowing each other out of the way to get their shot! Better ways to spend the day like...",
          "Statue was donated by the arabs of Palestine---wonder why? Great walk back down into city from here also.",
          "Great view of the Cusco city. Should be combined with other nearby activities. Location is well maintained. At night we can see the statue lit up from the market square.",
          "I'm not religious but I always wonder how could alll these people thing that the father of jesus would want to see his kid with nails in his hands on a cross, wouldn't you think they are trying to say hey well do this to you if you come to. But I'm not religious. Its nit\\ce to",
          "I reached the Statue of Christ after walking through the winding streets of San Blas. It was a beautiful sunny day and the area is a great place to spend time looking in local shops and then heading towards the statue. Take a picnic and hang out with a few llamas as you look",
          "We visited this as part of a day's tour, and the best thing is the spectacular views of Cusco and the surrounding mountains. The statue is noticeable because of being white and stands imposingly watching over the city. Not a significant experience for a Protestant, and one of",
          "If you want to see a greater Cusco then its pretty cool to come up here. Can be windy and lots of souvenirs for sale but the sellers are not pushy",
          "Obviously not as large/high as the statue in Brazil, but a lovely view of the mountains and Cusco from here, also has stone ruins of interesting villages in the nearby areas...",
          "Not as large as its doppelg\u00e4nger in Rio, but can be seen from square in town centre up in the mountains",
          "Great views of Cusco. We took the double decker bus tour to visit this and a few other sites. Bus was a good tour and inexpensive.",
          "We went here as part of our walking tour. We took a mini bus good for 24 people from San Cristobal Plaza and Church. It's a 10 minute drive. Along the way we stopped about 150-200 meters away from Saksayhuaman. The place is huge and amazing huge rocks piled on top of the other.",
          "Part of a tour to go there. Great views. Can also see Saxaywayman from here too. Go early to avoid crowds.",
          "This may be just another giant statue of Jesus; however, the view of the city and surrounding mountains is terrific!",
          "It was a nice gesture by the Palestinians to give Cusco this statue. It is not a spectacular monument, but it is interesting.",
          "The Cristo blanco statue is not all too impressive on its own as it is surrounded by wire fencing and therefore is a little bit obstructed once you reach the actual statue. However, the views from the platform near the statue are very good on a clear day and you can see all of",
          "The statue is interesting but not great piece of art, however the location is great and the view of Cusco from this hill is worth to visit this site. It is on the way to Tamobomachay.",
          "Going up to the statue was one of my favorite things within Cusco city. There is a local bus (colectivo) that stops right by the statue. The bus ride up was a blast, as it winds through the narrow streets on the hill. To me it was part of the experience of the statue! I think it",
          "Cristo Blanco is a landmark over the city. Yet if you get up close, there isn't much special about it. Folks at the Sacsayhuaman site might as well walk a half kilometer to see it. Otherwise, pull out your best zoom lens, and take a picture of it from the Plaza. The views",
          "The walk up is a little challenging especially if you have just arrived and are dealing with altitude adaptation. The views are stunning and worth the trip. Not much else to see on the top. It is a place where the Peruvian and international tourists meet. The pathway is easy to",
          "Just my point of view but I am just not into Religious Statues (exception Christ the Redeemer over Rio which is stunning) let alone this ugly statue which sticks out like a sore thumb. I think it spoils the really picturesque wooded & natural Incan terraced site of",
          "This was a surprise, hadn't heard about it. It can be seen from all over the city, a gift honoring the country for providing refuge to Europeans during WWII.",
          "The main attraction here is the view of the city. If you walk from the Plaza de Armas up to Sacsayhuaman (it's uphill but totally doable), you will get the same views with the bonus attraction of a very impressive ruins site.",
          "This Statue is worth a stop if you are driving by. I would not make a drive to it on its own. The view is great.",
          "Just another Jesus statue with the advantage of having Sacsayhuaman as a backdrop. You'll see it if you go to Sacsayhuaman but it's not worth seeing on its own.",
          "You can see this statue from most os Cusco so if you had a good lens this is the best view. At the site the ground in front drops off so very hard to get front photo. Good from side or rear. The tourist bus goes there and other sites and the usual tourist stop at a shop to",
          "Lovely white statue on the crest of the mountainside, with the right lighting (sun angle) you can get a great photo",
          "We visited Christo Blanco whilst on an open-top panoramic bus. We weren't expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised at the incredible views the statue offers! Cusco is such a beautiful city surrounded by enormous mountains, and you don't really realise this until you see it",
          "Beautiful white statute showing the devotion of Christianity of the Peruvian people in Cusco. Nice walk. Nice views of this quite large city.",
          "Fantastic photo op next th SECHUI HUAMAN temple site (also a MUST see). This location is a short stop to take picture of the whole city. The statue is nice but small compared to Rio's or Dili's",
          "The actual statue and accompanying crosses are not much to see or talk about. The views over Cusco is what makes this truly worthwhile. You get a good feel for the style and setting of the city and its buildings. A good 5-10 minute stop on the way out of Cusco.",
          "If you start in San Blas Square and hike up the long set of stairs above the fountain there, you will end up very close to this statue. Interestingly, based on the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brasil (Rio), it was given to the city by a group of thankful Palestinians who took",
          "Located on the top of a mountain outside of Cusco. Reminds of Rio. There are nice ruins right nearby.",
          "As other reviewers have said, you get a fabulous view from the statue over Cusco however it's hard to rate it highly as there's not much else here. It's def worth the short but steep hike or bus journey to experience the view but you will only spent probably 20-30 minutes here",
          "Title says it all Great View. Not much but the statues there. There were a few street vendors encamped at the base. We walked up farm Cusco but is as decibel by car.",
          "We walked up a very unique way, through alleys and stairways by houses. Don't buy the horseride from the horse guy. It's worth it to see the views of the City and then go to the Saucsayhuman nearby. You're in Cusco, might as well!",
          "It`s very worthy to go up there!! I suggets doing on the way back from horseback riding. You get to see the whole city!! It`s a awesome view!!",
          "A good view of the town achieved with a short hike up the hill. Little else to do once you are there unless this forms part of a bigger trek around nearby Sacsayhuaman.",
          "Mainly worth visiting for the view, though you probably get a better view from Sacsayhuaman itself. If you're driving it's a quick stop on the way to Sacsayhuaman. There was an interesting kiting party going on just below the monument when we were there.",
          "This statue is a super miniature version of the huge one found in Rio de Janeiro. We came here on a city tour and at the top there were a bunch of kids flying kites as well as llamas to take pictures with. This is a cool place to visit especially for the view of the city down",
          "It is worth wandering up to Christ to get great views of Cusco. It is is not too much of a walk from the top of San Blas. You also get decent views from Sacsayhuaman if you want to skip Jesus.",
          "Have a stop here if you can it gives a good view of the city, not the biggest christ but still a reasonable structure. You can get a good perspective of the old and the new from here.",
          "This is one of the highlights of Cuzco! It sits atop the city, and watches over it. You can get great views of the city below. The statue itself, is beautiful and white. At night, is is lit, and glows white. There are also 3 crosses next to the right of the statue. It is",
          "We visited the statue on our way back to Cusco. It was not on our itinerary but our driver offered to stop there, so we accepted the opportunity. You can see the statue from Cusco and it pops up very now and then on the road back from all the ruins and the sacred valley. If",
          "The white Statue of Christ is a gift to the city of Cusco from the people of Lebanon in 1940s. One can see the statue from the main square in Cusco. It took us 15 to 20min in a van to get to the statue from Cusco main square. Excellent views of the Cusco city from the statue.",
          "Impressive at night as the statue is illuminated and looks down over Cusco. I found the Sacsayhuaman ruins just behind this statue to be more impressive.",
          "Just a bit higher than San Blas, you can walk up to the Christ and enjoy a great view on the city of Cusco",
          "I took a cab to the statue and then walk/hiked back down. The statue itself is nice but what makes this a must is the view of the entire city to include \"Sacsayhuaman\" which is located a few hundred feet from \"Cristo\". (hint- I did not visit Sacsayhuaman and chose to just look",
          "Be sure to carve out time to visit Cristo Blanco. You won't be disappointed by the views. If it's sunny, you'll enjoy a breathtaking look at Cusco and many of its marquee sites.",
          "I walked up to the Statue of Christ twice, mainly because I liked walking up the stairs. I think the scenery and views of Cusco from this location are beautiful! You get a great view of the entire city and country side. The statue itself is not real memorable. I just don't",
          "My guide and I walked from Cusco city center to San Blas and on to the statue. It was a long walk, but we saw such beautiful and tranquil neighborhoods along the way. It was steep, so wear very comfortable shoes and watch the altitude effects. Worth the walk!",
          "It is an imposing feature above Cusco, but looks pretty worn up close and obviously needs maintenance. The story behind the statue is interesting. I recommend seeing it from some distance and not bothering to visit.",
          "Most interesting thing about it, is the brass plate indicating that it was built by the arab people of Palistine....But why?",
          "Walked to Cristo Blanco from the main square in Cusco which took about 45 minutes with a few stops. There's also buses if you're short on time. There were stunning views and makes you appreciate how big Cusco is. Well worth the trip up and also good training for climbing at",
          "If you are looking for a great spot to overview Cusco and the Valley, this is it. Best enjoyed late afternoon, when the sun casts the beautiful city and the scenery into a golden light. If you don't want to walk up all the steps, there are collectibles or taxis which take you up",
          "Worth the walk for a view over the city and a photo. If you don't have much time in Cuzco I wouldnt bother.",
          "It's quite unimpressive. There are other things that are much nicer to see. You can see it from the temple of the lightning god, sacsahyuaman, that will be more than enough. Granted, you have a good view of the city, but cuzco looks fairly unimpressive from above.",
          "This is another site that is beautiful and has a great overlook of the city of Cusco. It's not necessary to go right up to the base in order to enjoy it, though.",
          "Our guide took us here on the way to another site. You will get a good view of the city and be able to take some good pictures. There were some hikers playing guitars while we were there and they were actually good.",
          "You drive right past this on the standard half day tour to Sacsayhuaman. It wasn't in our program but our guide was kind enough to have the driver pull in so we could enjoy the view. Definitely a worth a quick photo stop.",
          "We visited this site on a double decker bus tour and also hiked to this point as a training hike with Action Peru Treks. Beautiful site and loved seeing the Christ light up at night on the hill.",
          "The statue is a turistic attraction, more because of the city view than from properly the statue. You have a beautiful view of the city, the mountains around and the Sacsayaman site. If you get to the statue you are walking distance from the ruins.",
          "Close to town and Sasayhuman. Easy to get to but not worth extra trip. A few people walked over to view it up close.",
          "There's a decent view over Cusco and suburbs, but the scenery is rather typical of South American cities - plenty of poorly constructed house and hints of shanty areas. Plenty guides around taking pictures of their charges at this regular stopping point for them. Statue",
          "This tall statue towers over the Cuzco valley and is worth walking up to. Without a guide, you will take a picture and leave quickly. Its background might take another 5 to 10 minutes. It is worth seeing up close as part of the Incan temple visit.",
          "This is smaller than Christ the redeemer in Rio de Janeiro. Still, it has its own beauty. It can be seen at plaza de armas or sacsayhuaman too.",
          "We walked here from Sacsayhuaman which was only like a 5 min walk. The statue itself if surrounded by a fence and barbed wire so it doesn't make for very good photos but I'd still go just for the beautiful views of Cusco",
          "Standing tall above the city, the statue is most impressive at night, as the light is illuminating it. It is also pretty in the day time, but the best time to see it is at night. You don't have to go up to it, just drive somewhere in the city where it is visible.,",
          "We enjoyed walking from our AirBnB place in San Blas to Sacsayhuaman, then across to Cristo Blanco (White Christ) and down the steep staircases back down into town. The views were beautiful!",
          "nice statue, but you cannot get a good location to take a photo without a fence being in the way. Ok since it is free.",
          "You can see it from many areas, just take your picture and move on. Not much up close that makes it worth the walk up.",
          "Combine a visit here with Saqsayhuman. You can walk to the statue. It is also great to see from the city itself as it is lit up at night.",
          "Not worth a visit by itself, but if you are on your way to Pisac or some other attraction and you are in the area is OK for a five minute stop. You do get a good view of Cusco but other than that ther is not much to see.",
          "Looks good from afar. But does not match the hype. Location & view from there is awesome. But such statues are aplenty especially after Cristo , the Redeemer , in Brazil , it is diminutive !",
          "From the main plaza in Cusco you can look up to this and it is a sight to behold! And from here, during the day, the overlook over Cusco is phenomenal. This is also at the edge of Saqsaywaman, btw.",
          "This is a great stop if going to Saqsaywaman Ruins. I wouldn't make it a point to visit if you've gone to the statue in Lima or Rio in Brazil. The views of the entire city however are spectacular from this point.",
          "First day in Cusco, went for a bite, then decided to hike up to the statue. We took the challenging way, through town, up the trail, through a neighborhood, through a brush area, finally arriving. Thought my lungs were going to explode. Very excited when made it up. We continued",
          "This was our first stop after arriving in Cuzco. Amazing view with a good workout for your lungs too.",
          "While touring the city, it is easy to see the statue of Christ from different areas of the city. It was a simple statue, but great to see. The statue stands in appearance like the one in Brazil. I had no idea that they had their own statue of Christ! Nevertheless, if you are",
          "As part of a walking tour of Cusco, we visited the Cristo Blanco. It was an exhilarating uphill walk which not only allowed us an opportunity to visit the statue but also provided panoramic views of the city. If you have the energy, get up there and take a look!!",
          "We took the bus up to the Statue of Christ, or Cristo Blanco (1 sole per person). It is really easy. Catch the bus in the centre or on Recoletta as we did. The bus will say Cristo Blanco on the front. The bus winds up through town and stay on until the houses stop and you",
          "The statue is breathtaking when you see if from across the city. I would recommend, however, not driving up to actually walk around it. It has a metal fence and spotlights around the base and the paint is peeling and chipped. It looked so sad up close but so beautiful from afar.",
          "A big white statue of Christ on top of the hill. Pretty self explanatory. Not as big as we were expecting, nothing awe inspiring, but interesting enough. Expect to spend 3-5 minutes there enjoying the view of Cusco. Some craft vendors outside. Statue built in 1945 according the",

          "Well worth the hike to see the views from this statue. The statue itself is not very big. But the views of Cusco city are why you come here. Very calm and peaceful place. Not many locals selling you things. Right next to Saqsaywaman",
          "but the Inka ruins around the area are much more interesting.Nice place but only as an afterthought to all the really good Inka sites around Cusco. Supposedly provided by Muslim immigrants after WWII it's a nice enough statue",

          "The cross standing on the top of the hill is similar to Christ Render in Rio but it is not an attraction worth visiting. It is very nice to look at and as it is visable from almost anywhere in Cusco this can be enough.",
          "The statue of Christ is visible from many parts of Cusco. It's a short walk up a moderate hill that does not seem that difficult until you realize that you are above 11,000 ft. in elevation. It sucks the air out of you. It is actually a better view from a short distance than",
          "I thought it was Christ the Redeemer but it turns out it was a smaller version and no one told me that until I arrived. I had to fly to Brazil and it cost me an extra $2000, I was completely and utterly boned by Jp Hamelins snapchat.",
          "Use GPS to navigate through the suburbs below the statue. Cut through some side streets, climb a few steps and find a short dirt track through the trees. With a bit of skill you can use this route to avoid travelling up the main route and paying up to 70 soles just for",

          "On one morning, we took the tour bus around the sights (we were suffereing a little from the altitude). The bus slowly trundled up the windey mountainside to the statue of christ. The view from there, looking down at Cusco is breathtaking. Worth while visiting.",

          "Since you can see this statue from all over Cuzco, it is surprising to get there and find how small it actually is. Maybe that is in comparison the more famous and much larger Christo Redentor statue in Rio, of which this is a miniature. Nevertheless, it is worth a closer",

          "I visited here with my wife by sightseeing bus, and we were given ten minutes to enjoy here. The view from this hill to the brown colored village was fantastic. There was a local woman with baby sheep and llama. We took many photos with them with 10 sol (3 USD), which would be",
          "Saw Cristo Blanco from Sacsayhuaman ruins and the Plaza De Armas, that was close enough to get a good glimpse of it...didn't have the extra energy or need to go close as there are way more exciting things to see at Sacsayhuaman and other places with the Megalithic stones.",
          "The statue looked impressive from afar and I reckon the best photo could be taken from a distance. In close proximity the statue is very clean, white and looked like it was built this year. I didn't walk around it, but it was not as big as the one in Brazil.",
          "We took a city tour on an old trolley and this was one of the stops. (We really recommend the trolley tour). We stopped here for 10 minutes to take pictures with the statue and the view of the city of Cusco. There were some souvenir vendors and a lady there offering a baby",

          "Well, it is a big statue. Hard to get a good photo due to the fence around it. The view of the city is nice though. There was a lady with a lama that you could take photos with for a donation. I was not overly impressed. It is a place to stop for photos. No tour needed.",

          "The statue of Christ itself over Cusco is pretty much a waste of time, in and of itself. It's a smallish statue, not a very high quality work, and does not offer anything other than something to look at. It's also surrounded by trinket sellers, tip-seeking persons with llamas,",
          "Cusco is a very charming city! Don't miss the views from this statue landmark. You can get there by bus, but it's more fun to make the 45 minute walk. Start from behind the cathedral and continue up the hill until you find the stairs. Follow the stairs all the way to the top,",
          "We stopped at this site on our bus tour, and although the statue is somewhat impressive, the view is amazing. If you have time, make sure you make your way up the hill for just the views of Cusco. It\u2019s not until I was up here, I realized how large Cusco was.",

          "Overlooking the city of Cusco is the statue of Cristo Blanco (White Christ) - not unlike Rio's Christ the Redeemer. It was built by a group of Christian Palestinians who had sought refuge in Cusco and was their parting gift to the city when they left \u2013 also a symbol of their",
          "There isn't much else to it besides the statue and the wonderful view of Cuzco. You can see the entire city. It was a site to see. You can see the statue from the city as well. At night it is has lights illuminating it. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way just to see it.",
          "You could couple the visit to the statue of Christ while you are exploring sacsayhuaman since the statue is an extension to this complex and there is a trail that you could follow to reach up the hill. Once here, the view is to die for. Nothing will give you such a spectacular",
          "This was an amazing place to view the city as its at 3600 metres which is over 200 metres higher than Cusco. You could also see some of the ruins of Saqsaywawan which is one of the villages in the Sacred Valley.",

          "Like most tourist, we jumped on a bus to get to the top instead of walking. As everyone has said, besides the statue, there are great views of Cusco. You can easily see Plaza De Armas from the statue. It seems you can never get a good picture of the statue since the sun is",
          "Great view from this point and the statue is quite nice. I saw Christ the Redeemer in Brazil only a few weeks ago, so unfortunately I'm probably comparing it in my mind to that too much, so didn't find this one overly impressive.",
          "I decided to wake up early and go check out the sunrise from this spot. It was a breath-taking view. If you're here before 7am you don't have to pay entrance fee for Cristo Blanco or Sacsayhuaman, which is 5min walk from Cristo Blanco.",
          "We stopped at the statue on a small detour to the airport and so glad we did.. Has an awesome view across the while of Cusco. Th statue itself isn't much to look at as it's all fenced off but definitely go for the view and cheap souvenirs from the locals. Plus it's free :)",
          "A pity about all the fencing around the Cristo Blanco statue, making it difficult to get a decent photo of it. However there is a very good view of Cusco from here. It is adjacent to the Inca site of Saqsaywaman, so we visited the statue at the same time.",

          "Cristo Blanco (of White Christ) is located on a hill, which provides a spectacular and panoramic view to the city. The Statue was a gift from the Christian Palestinians who were seeking refuge in Cuzco in 1945. It was a symbol of their gratitude toward the city, and was their",

          "Going up to Cristo Blanco is free whereas Saqsaywaman is 70 soles each. If you\u00b4re content to read about Saqsaywaman before or afterwards, you will get a pretty good overview from Cristo Blanco (perhaps then decide whether you want to go into the Saqsaywaman archaelogical park).",
          "In my small tour group we headed out of Cusco on our way to Ollantaytambo. Cusco is pretty high above sea level but making our way out of the town we were ascending! This really tested my altitude sickness! It is a pity this statue is completely fenced making pictures look",

          "What an amazing view of Cusco. It's right next to the famous inca site Sacsayhuaman. You don't need the tourist ticket if it just want to walk up to the statue - just tell the guy at the gate what you're doing. Great way to test how you're coping with the altitude. I wasn't that",
          "Was surprised to see this statue when visit the inca site of Sacsayhuaman. It's not as large as the redeemer statue in Rio, but is still a sight to enjoy, with the views of cusco below.",
          "A lovely statue with a nice story of its origins. It overlooks the valley below and the lovely Andes all around.",
          "The best thing about this location is the view over the valley, unless you are looking for a little more exercise, I say skip this one, the view from Sacsayhuaman is better.",
          "We took a city tour and there are some ruins right next to it, the place is fantastic but there is some climbing up involved and due to the high attitude it gets extenuating at some point. I just recommended to do it a few days after been in Cusco so you don't get sick.",

          "I came up to this statue when I entered Sacsayhuaman. Incredible views over Cusco. I also got a taxi up here at night with some friends, the view is even better at night! Although, it is very cold. Definitely worth the walk/taxi ride.",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "Once again, this red fortress as it was called, does not evoque the same awe feelings as many other Inca remains around Cuzco, but as it is near other small Inca sites, it is worth visiting as part of the tour. Good views and some good spots",
          "The highest point in altitude on our city tour of Cusco, and it was an amazing view. Used as a watch tower and fort, it was cool to be able to see at a distance and to see the agriculture sites around the area.",
          "We visited this site as part of a 5-stop bus tour to Lake Titicaca from Cusco. It was very, very interesting. Also has a small market with some different items than others we had been at and the prices were very reasonable!",
          "One can see this sight from the road and it is quite nice. After viewing other larger sights, this sight is good, but is over shadowed by the other sights.",
          "Another stunning site in the greater Cusco area, very well perserved and if you have an educated and eloquent guide you can understand a lot around the way of life of the Incas. Definately a place not to miss!",

          "Puka Pukara is one of several sites that anticipate Machu Picchu. Visiting the multiple sites around Cusco provides a historical overview of the Inka Empire.",

          "This was the third of the Inka sites that we visited with our guide, and in fairness, the least interesting. It's attraction is that it is part of the Inka communications system, but I doubted the story of messengers running to the coast and back in a day - far too far. The",

          "This is a small site close to Tambomachay and worth the visit. Notice as you enter what looks like a throne facing the east. This is where the rays of the winter solstice sun first shine out, allowing the Earth to capture the sun for another year. Also notice the beautifully",
          "Perhaps not the biggest or most impressive site, nonetheless worth a visit. Some walking required but relative to other sites, not too physically demanding. Definitely an interesting place to see if you've the time.",
          "Not far from Tombomachay so while over there one might as well visit. Nicely preserved but because of the lack of explantion hard to figure out exectly what one is looking at. So a detailed book with descriptions is needed to make sense of it all;",
          "The location is not large but definite worth the stop in the set of sites of Sacssaywaman, Q'engo and Tambomachay. The location is prominently placed on the top of a ridge commanding excellent views down the different valleys. It served as a check point and also a sort of guest",
          "The pre-Inca and Inca cultural sites can run together. This one stands out as being quite distinctive. If you're ruling things in or out, I'd make this one a keeper.",
          "Easy day trip from Cusco! Book it through Inca Trail Reservations. They are local so you can walk to their office and book the trip and also purchase tickets-boleta touristic there. The tour bus was clean, the bus drive was very friendly, our guide spoke excellent English and",
          "I visited Puka Pukara as part of a morning visiting all four ruins near Cusco, but sadly it was raining so the spectacular location was rather diminished. It's a fairly small site with lovely views over the valley and worth stopping by if you're also going to Tambomachay. To",
          "As the guide explained this set of ruins was a complement to Tambomachay rather than being a structure of any individual importance. There's not much to see. Only about 30% remains of it. It started raining and the ticket checkers ran off and didn't bother stamping the boleto.",
          "The view is amazing, the ruins are average, but the historic facts surrounding this place are worth visiting it.",
          "Of all the sites on this hill covered by the partial Boleto Turistico (the ticket you have to buy to visit certain Inca sites in Cusco), Sacsayhuaman is really the best. Puka Pukara is really just another Inca site, so don't go out of your way to see it since it's better",
          "This is near a couple of other Inca sites, so it's easy to include when exploring the area. Interesting archaeology and not difficult to walk around the site.",
          "Well for starters it is an example of Incan ruins and architecture. I did not think you absolutely could not miss this site. We took about 15-20 minutes. Glad to say I saw it, but not a must see.",
          "Impressive ruin with fortifications and right by Tambomachay. another site. There were a good lead up to Sacsayhauman and help tell the story of the people. We actually hiked the 8km back to Cusco visiting the sites along the way. It was easy walking but there is no trail and it",
          "Visited along with Tambomachay across the road, this site features multiple double-jam doorways, which designate special, particularly royal, places. Besides the fine examples of masonry, however, there isn't that much to see... the actual function of this site is unknown. Often",

          "It is worth having a look at Puka Pukara on the sacred valley pass, you can take in Tambomachay, Sacsayhuaman and other close ruins on the same day. Puka Pukara is a bit of a military fortress, with a few cool inca wall structures. Plenty of public buses go by if you are going",
          "There are larger and more extensive and better preserved ruins in the Cusco area, but if you are making \"rounds of the ruins\", this is a nice one to include!",
          "This is an interesting site and does not take long to visit (about 15 minutes is sufficient). There is no information or signs, so if you don\u2019t go with a guide, do some research on it before you visit otherwise it will pretty much just be another ruin\u2026 Entry is by Boleto",

          "I grabbed a cab in Cusco with 3 other friends for 70 soles total and he took us to all the Inca sites surrounding Puka Pukara. The view from here was phenomenal! Would recommend visiting all the sites close by- should only take a couple hours to see everything.",
          "Visited this place on the way to Puno by bus. Near a mountain base. A small tunnel is here. Remains of a temple structure is also here",
          "Another Inca ruin and signs would be helpful here as in other ruins. The views were very pretty. As in all ruins the women selling crafts are there, which can be a little off putting",
          "This is one of 6 sites you get to see on the Cusco City tour and the bus literally stopped for 5 minutes so people could take a photo as well as the guide explaining the site was a guard post on the Inca trail leading to Cusco. Buy all means go as part of the Cusco City tour",
          "On the route from Cuzco to Puno, our bus tour group stopped off in Pukara. Our enthusiastic guide took us to this terraced pyramid which is little hard to make out. But with proper explanation, the story comes to life. There is even a tunnel which you can take to get a little",

          "It means red fortress. Unlike other Inca structures, this one is built from irregular shaped stones. It is a simple site and there isn't much to see. It is ok to stop briefly if you are on your way to Tambomachay.",
          "A part of the city tour covering the four famous sites closest to Cusco, Puka Pukara stands out for its amazing views over the valley. On a clear day you can also catch a glimpse of Ausangate, a beautiful snowy peak that watches over the valley.",
          "This site, a few miles outside Cusco, offers great views of the surrounding countryside and mountains. The ruins are not all that impressive, but it is located just across the street from Tambomachay and is great as part of the 4 ruins tour from Cusco.",
          "We stopped here as part of a tour from MP (Ollantaytambo) to our hotel in Cusco. I believe that these were the highest elevation of any of the Inca ruins, and it was significantly harder to breath here than it was at MP. If you miss this, you will be fine IMHO.",
          "A little ways out of Cusco proper and up in the hills. This is another Incan site included on many of the tours that originate in the city proper.",
          "This fortress of the Inca Empire was exceptional. It made for some very nice pictures! Not a lot of climbing involved to see this site, you can take great pictures and see it from the vehicle pull-over.",
          "Excellent tour guide, quietly told us of all the sights, local people and spoke very clear English which was an asset",
          "Off the road to Pisac. We walked in without being challenged. No toilets. We bussed up from Cusco for S./3 to this site. Take the El Heurto bus. We walked back to Cusco after seeing the Tambo Machay which is 300 m down the road. This is part of the 16 attraction Boleto Turistico",
          "This ruin was a market (custom) where Incas check the products that came to Cuzco from the valley. Also know as military point. Maybe it was both. It is a good place to took some pictures, nice views. You need the Cuzco Pass (130 soles) that you could use in quenco,",
          "What struck me the most about this site was the gorgeous backdrop among the ruins! We took many pictures of the beautiful green landscape. There was also a field full of alpacas off to the side. It is worth visiting for a quick little hike!",

          "I honestly felt that this is a site that I could have skipped, there is not really that much here other than the terraces and a few small structures. If you are doing a tour on your own and have plans to see other areas like the Sacred Valley, save yourself some time and just",

          "We were at this place and together with my friends we concluded that this was a mini fortress to watch over the inka baths fountains nearby...I forgot the name...It is a very interesting place having a characteristic reddish color.",
          "This small site is well worth half an hour. Our guide described the difference in the 2 types of stone walls - one sacred, the other more ordinary.",
          "If you are near Tambomachay and Sacsayhuaman and have some free time, I would recommend stoping by. Its the least impressive ruins out of the four but still interesting. It was an old fortress for the Incas. Great views of the farm land near by.",
          "I'd echo what the previous reviewer (Sarah) wrote - nice enough ruins, no entrance check for your ticket, but nothing special. See them if you have time and are in the area (or if they are part of your tour), but I'd rate the others in the area as more interesting.",
          "Technically you need the Boleto Turistico to visit, but there is no actual check gate for this site. Just across the street there is the other site, Tambomachay which does have a check gate. Puka Pukara is worth a quick visit along the way, but has the least to see of the four",
          "Just to think about what went on here back in Incan times is amazing. Puka Pukara offers a lovely view of the Incan Trail, also called the Royal Trail, as they used it back then. Views all around are breath-taking. All trails connect to Cuzco. Messengers would take notes",
          "Our group tour stopped here on our way to Cusco. There is nothing much to see, some remains of a rest stop for the Incas. However, I enjoy the view of the surrounding mountains and plains. Good for some photo shots.",
          "Not much to see or experience.There is one compound built of stones and other than that nothing much.",

          "Puka Pukara is interesting but mainly in the context of a larger tour of Inca sites in the Cusco area. The ruins are spread over a fairly large area but are not as impressive as Sacsayhuaman or Tambomachay, for example. The area is very scenic, however, so you might enjoy",
          "Puka Pukara, also known as the Red Fortress, is a site of military ruins in Peru situated about 4 to 5 miles from Cusco. The fort is located on high ground overlooking the Cusco valley with views of the surrounding jungle and ruins. It is made of large walls, terraces, and",

          "This site was part of our city tour. 15 minutes will be plenty to see what there is left of these ruins. They are cool, but pale in comparison to the bigger sites close by.",
          "A small and relatively insignificant site compared to many others, and probably only worth a visit if included on an organised tour. It's main claim to fame seems to be that it is on the line, (one of the 42 Inca lines radiating out from the Qoricancha temple in Cusco), that",
          "The setting is really nice, although it's only 10 minutes from cusco city it feels as being on the nice Peruian countryside. The ruins however are not comparable with other sites in this ancient country. You see it all in 2 minutes and that's it..",
          "This is a nice place to visit if you have the boleto turistico. There is a nice view on the valley, and it is on the classic itinerary. What you can do from here is go downhill in the valley to Q'enqo, by foot, far from the road, and visit the temple of the moon on the way; this",
          "Small interesting site outside of Cusco. A ceremonial place and also a place where bodies of nobles were prepared. Inside cave like area the \"altar\" is ice cold. (Better to preserve a body?)",
          "As part of the tour of ruins around the cusco are are the Puka Pucara ruins. We stopped there with the tour guide but I was not impressed. There's a good opportunity for a picture but other than that it was not as impressive as I taught it would be.",
          "Puka = red and pukara = fort so Pukapukara means red fort. There are several intact walls and structures to walk around. The terrain makes for pretty easy walking. Bring a good guide book with you as there is little information on site. The views from this sight are quite",

          "We have visited this site on our way travelling from Urubamba to Cusco combined with other attractions in the area such as the Animal Sanctuary Cochahuasi, Tambomachay and Sacsayhuaman. I was not impressed by this place however it is worth a few minutes stop if you are in the",
          "One of the many ruins just outside Cucso, and included on the Boleto Turistico ticket - you may as well spend a few minutes here. Our guide said this was once a lodging house, one of many at intervals along the Inca trail. From the walls of the ruins you can look down onto",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco or CTTC) was founded by indigenous weavers from the community of Chinchero as well as international supporters in 1996 as a non-profit organization. It is based out of the city of Cusco, Peru where its main offices, museum and shop are located. The CTTC works in support of indigenous weavers from the Cusco region to recover traditional Cusque\u00f1an textiles. The organization currently partners with ten communities from the Cusco region: Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas).\n\n\n== Mission and vision ==\nThe CTTC's mission is to \"promote the empowerment of weavers through the sustainable practice of Peruvian ancestral textile traditions in the Cusco region. This enables the weavers to maintain their identity and textile traditions while improving their quality of life through workshops, opportunities, and the promotion of their textile art.\" The CTTC's aim is to revive Pre-Columbian textile traditions and provide support to weaving communities.Due to racism, colonialism, poverty, and more, textile traditions in the Cusco region were in danger of disappearing during the 20th century. In the Andes, textiles are an important part of everyday life and a key component of local culture. This ancient way of life, passed down for thousands of years from generation to generation, has been at risk since the days of the Conquest. Traditional textiles were such a strong symbol of indigenous identity and resistance to colonial rule, that the Spanish outlawed their creation and use. Despite this, the people of the Andes continued practicing their textile traditions until the 20th century. Under pressure from changes brought about by globalization, including the introduction of chemical dyes and fibers, traditional textiles experienced a dramatic decline in the 1900s.Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to empower weavers and achieve its vision \"To place the weaver of ancestral textiles as a recognized global artist, forging a just recognition by society and assuring the continuity of the ancestral textile practice.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the 1960s, an informal group of women weavers from the community of Chinchero gathered together to revive textile traditions and earn an independent income from male relatives through the sale of their textiles in the tourist market. When the husband and wife pair of ethnobotnists Christine and Ed Franquemont arrived in Chinchero in the 1970s to conduct research, they encouraged the weavers to continue their community organizing work. With the support of the Franquemonts and other international friends, the group of weavers founded a cultural center in Chinchero. When this cultural center failed, the weavers re-organized under the leadership of Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez to found the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (CTTC).The CTTC was founded in 1996 as a non-profit organization registered with APCI in Peru by weavers from Chinchero and their international supporters. Key founders of the CTTC include: Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez, Elizabeth and David Van Buskirk, Maria Tocco, Christine and Ed Franquemont, Yolanda Jaime Calla\u00f1aupa, Yenny Calla\u00f1aupa, Flora Calla\u00f1aupa de Hendrickson, Betty Doerr, and Tim Wells, amongst many others. The CTTC originally partner with a handful of communities in the Cusco region to revive textile traditions, including the communities of Accha Alta, Chahuaytire, Chinchero and Pitumarca. Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez has served as director of CTTC since 1996. The board of directors includes: Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez, Flora Calla\u00f1aupa de Hendrickson, Yolanda Jaime Calla\u00f1aupa, Hilda Roque Perez, Miriam Luna, and Betty Doerr.Until 2001 the CTTC was run out of the basement of the home of Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez. After an extensive capital campaign, the CTTC purchased and remodeled a building on Av. Sol 603, Cusco, Per\u00fa to house its offices, museum, and store.\nIn 2010 the CTTC held Tinkuy 2010: Gathering of Weavers, an international conference that gathered together indigenous weavers, textile artists, art historians, anthropologists and others to discuss and share textile traditions from around th world. In 2013, CTTC organized the second Tinkuy titled Tinkuy 2013: Gathering of Weavers.\n\n\n== The weaving associations ==\nThe CTTC has partnered with ten communities from the Cusco region:  Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas). In each community the weavers have formed autonomous weaving associations, each registered with the Peruvian government. Each weaving association is self-governed through elected officials (President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer), who are elected once a year. Each weaving association determines its own rules and regulates member participation.\nIn each community the CTTC has built a weaving center for the associations where the weavers can gather to meet and work. The weaving centers are composed of a central grassy courtyard for weaving in good weather while the surrounding complex of buildings are used for weaving in poor weather conditions, meetings, and include space for storage and a kitchen. Each association gathers once a week in their weaving center to work and organize.\n\n\n=== Accha Alta ===\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Munay Pallay Awaqkuna de Accha Alta\"\nCommunity: Accha Alta\nDistrict: Calca\nProvince: Calca\nRegion: Cusco\nAccha Alta is located approximately 2 hours northeast of the city of Cusco. Nestled on a steep mountain slope next to the ruins of Ankasmarka, an ancient Incan granary, this remote mountain community looks out over the valley below. Most people in Accha Alta only speak Quechua, the local indigenous language, and rely on their chakras (fields) to produce much of the food they need for their families. At 12,930 feet above sea level, very few crops grow in the thin mountain air except for potatoes and other tubers. Accha Alta is well known for its many potato varieties and people from as far away as Cusco come to buy Accha Alta potatoes.The community of Accha Alta began working with the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco in 1998. In the beginning almost all of the association members knew how to weave, but solely used synthetic fibers. Since 1998, the weavers have returned to using natural materials, which includes natural dyes in sheep, alpaca, and llama wool. Accha Alta weavers are very proud of their traditions, and place emphasis on the young weavers, ensuring that their traditions are carried on into the future. There are approximately 40 adult members in Accha Alta's weaving association and 35 children.Accha Alta textiles are recognized for their thin sections of plain weave and wide designs in the ley (supplementary warp) technique. Traditional textiles from Accha Alta are white and red. Common designs include patterns of lakes, which are represented as diamonds, for example, wasqa qocha, or long lakes. Accha Alta textile artists manage a number of techniques, including: backstrap weaving in the ley technique, backstrap weaving in the doble cara technique, knitting (including the Qhurpus knitting technique), sling braiding, rope braiding, the tubular border weaving chichilla, and the crotcheted stitch known as kumpay used on the edges of textiles.\n\n\n=== Acopia ===\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Cuatro Lagunas de Acopia\"\nCommunity: Acopia\nDistrict: Acopia\nProvince: Acomayo\nRegion: Cusco\nAcopia is located about two hours south of the city of Cusco in an area known as the Four Lakes, or land of Valicha after a popular huayno (folk song). The four high mountain lakes provide sustenance to local people who rely on them for fishing and irrigation for their fields. Acopia is located on the banks of the third and smallest lake.The weaving tradition in Acopia nearly disappeared completely as the younger generation did not continue in the footsteps of their elders. The CTTC began working with Acopia in 2006, helping the elders pass on their knowledge to younger generations. There are approximately 30 adult members in Acopia\u2019s weaving association and 20 children.Traditional Acopia blankets are woven with many thin designs in the doble cara (two sided warp-faced) technique. A distinguishing design from the community is organo q\u2019enqo, a zig-zag pattern.\n\n\n=== Chahuaytire ===\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Inka Pallay de Chahuaytire\"\nCommunity: Chahuaytire\nDistrict: Pisac\nProvince: Calca\nRegion: Cusco\nChahuaytire is located in the mountains above the valley town of Pisaq approximately 25 miles north of the city of Cusco. There is an Incan trail that leads from the lowlands near P\u00edsac to the highlands of Chahuaytire that has been in use since pre-Columbian times. Chahuaytire weavers care for flocks of alpaca, llama and sheep higher in the mountains around their community. The CTTC began working with Chahuaytire in 1999.  There are approximately 35 adult members in Chahauytire's weaving association and 40 children.Chahuaytire weavers are well known locally for the high quality of their weavings. Their compact warp-faced weave, careful colour combinations, and detail to border finishes make Chahuaytire textiles some of the finest in the Cusco region. Chahuaytire weavers use both the doble cara (complementary warp) and ley (supplementary warp) techniques to create wide designs. Traditional textiles from Chahauytire are dark marooon and white. Designs are woven in dark marroon or purple on white backgrounds, while plain weave pampa sections are modulations of varying hues in dark purple. maroon and/or black. Chahuaytire weavers are experts in color combination, and modulate color tones in non-traditional textiles. A common design from Chahuaytire is tika qocha, lake with flowers, which often features on blankets and ponchos. Chahauytire blankets are characterized by their unique star, or rose, stich which unites the two sides of the blanket.\n\n\n=== Chinchero ===\nAssociation: \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\"\nCommunity: Chinchero\nDistrict: Chinchero\nProvince: Urubamba\nRegion: Cusco\nChinchero is known as the \u2018birthplace of the rainbow\u2019 and is located on a high plain 45 minutes outside the city of Cusco. The town of Chinchero is composed of smaller communities, including: Cuper Bajo, Cuper Alto, Huaypo, Yanacona, and others. Chinchero is located on the road between Cusco and Urubamba, which means that thousands of  tourists pass through Chinchero en route from the airport in Cusco to the famed ruins of Machu Picchu beyond Urubamba. Many tourists stop in Chinchero to visit the ruins of the summer residence of Inca Tupac Yupanqui and to witness the town's weaving tradition. Since the CTTC began its work in the textile field, many other small textile centers have emerged in Chinchero and the town has become increasingly commercial.The Chinchero weaving association was the founding association of CTTC in 1996. There are approximately 40 adult members in the Chinchero weaving association and 40 children. Since the 1960s until today, the Association \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\" (not to be confused with the many other textile centers in Chinchero that sprung up afterward), has succeeded in bringing weaving to the forefront of their community. The town of Chinchero is known internationally as a prominent Andean weaving community where efforts to revive traditions have also revitalized the town itself.As Chinchero is located on a major tourist byway, the weavers of the Chinchero weaving association offer demonstrations to visiting tourists and run a small store in their weaving center.\n\n\n=== Huacatinco ===\nAssociation \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Tejedores Wi\u00f1ay Awaqkuna de Huacatinco\"\nCommunity: Huacatinco\nDistrict: Ocongate\nProvince: Quispicanchis\nRegion: Cusco\nHuacatinco is the latest community to partner with CTTC; it joined the non-profit in 2011. The community is located in the Ocongate district, approximately three hours south of the city of Cusco. While Huacatinco is rich in local culture and looks out over the snow-capped peaks of the Ausungate mountain range, it is one of the most impoverished areas of Peru. Some parts of the district have been abandoned by government services and local families are forced to be self-sufficient. Most rely on their chakra (fields) and flocks of alpaca and llama for survival. Local people mostly speak Quechua, and continue to wear their traditional clothing on a daily basis.Before partnering with CTTC, weavers from the Huacatinco association found it difficult to sell their textiles. After traveling the three hours to the city of Cusco, they would search for buyers, often in vain. When a store or merchant was interested in their products, they offered extremely low prices for the detailed work. Rather than paying the weavers upfront, they would withhold payment for months, if they even paid the weavers at all. Some merchants would agree to buy the textiles, but would never follow through with their promise of future payment.Today approximately 25 adult weavers and 20 children are members of the Huacatinco weaving association. The weavers are working to finish construction on their weaving center and to investigate their textile traditions with elders. Through the fair-trade sale of their textiles with CTTC, they are assured of a steady income for their families.In Huacatinco both women and men knit elaborately patterned hats called chullo and weave fine textiles with the backstrap loom. Both men's and women's traditional clothing are elaborated with embroidery in white beads.\n\n\n=== Mahuaypampa ===\nAssociation:  \"Centro de Tejedores Virgen Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n de Mahuaypampa\"\nCommunity: Mahuaypampa\nDistrict: Maras\nProvince: Urubamba\nRegion: Cusco\nMahuaypampa is located approximately 50 km to the northwest of the city of Cusco in the Maras district, just off the highway between Cusco and Urubamba. Situated on a high altiplano, the community dedicates itself to agriculture as it is well situated on a wide rolling plain.The textile tradition in Mahuaypampa almost disappeared as few children were learning from their elders. The Mahuaypampa association partnered with the CTTC in 2000. Since then the community has worked to recover its weaving tradition. Today there are approximately 30 adult weavers and 12 children in the Mahuaypampa weaving association.Traditional designs in Mahuaypampa are small and narrow. Because of this, weavers will typically place many designs next to each other in order to build up a wider design composition. The design mayu qenqo, said to represent the Milky Way, is one of the principal designs of Mahuaypampa. Blankets in Mahuaypampa are characterized by the enagua seam, which represents petticoats and is used to unite the two halves of the textile.\n\n\n=== Patabamba ===\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Away Paccarichiq Pallay Tika de Patabamba\"\nCommunity: Patabamba\nDistrict: Coya\nProvince: Calca\nRegion: Cusco\nPatabamba is located high in the mountains above the Sacred Valley overlooking the town of Pisac. There are many Incan ruins located around the community. A high mountain lake is located above Patabamba. Here locals pasture their flocks of sheep, alpaca and llama while also occasionally fishing for trout. Few traditional festivals are still celebrated in Patabamba. This decline in local culture is attributed to conflicts between the older Catholic tradition and new Evangelical tradition that prohibits the expression of older belief systems.As just a handful of elders knew how to weave in Patabamba, the weaving tradition nearly disappeared. The Patabamba association partnered with the CTTC in 2001 and today approximately 40 adult weavers and 15 children are members. They continue to work to revive their weaving tradition.Traditional lliklla (blankets) from Patabamba are woven with a wide sections of plain weave in red or green. Design sections are woven in the doble cara (complementary warp) technique. Often, weavers will sew a strip of blue or green fabric, often velvet, around the edge of their blankets. Over this border frame they will embroider figures in white thread, often images of fish, flowers, and birds. While this embellishment is decorative, it also serves to protect blanket edges from fraying with use.\n\n\n=== Pitumarca ===\nAssociation: \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Tejedores Munay Ticlla del Distrito de Pitumarca\"\nCommunity: Pitumarca\nDistrict: Pitumarca\nProvince: Canchis\nRegion: Cusco\nPitumarca is located approximately two hours south of the city of Cusco, off the main highway passing the town of Checacupe. Pitumarca is now a large town, and weavers from surrounding communities come down from the mountains to participate in the Pitumarca weaving association which partnered with CTTC in 1997. There are approximately 50 adult weavers and 25 children in the Pitumarca weaving association. The weavers of Pitumarca have maintained for thousands of years, from generation to generation, dozens of complex textile techniques that can be directly traced to specific pre-Columbian cultures. These include: ley (supplementary warp), doble cara, (complementary warp), amapolas (a weaving technique that allows for designs on both sides of the textiles in up to five colors), ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft), sling and rope braiding, knitting, and other techniques. Pitumarca textiles are some of the finest and most complex in the Cusco region, and the town's official slogan is the \"Andean capital of textiles.\" Weavers of the Pitumarca association are incredibly proud of their hard work to investigate and revive techniques like ticlla, and wear their traditional clothing with honor and pride.Pitumarca is known internationally for its revival of the ticlla (discontinuous warp and weft) technique. This complex technique allows a weaver to change the color of their warp thread by inserting sticks into their warp. The weaver warps one color between one set of warp sticks, and another color between the following set of warp sticks. The weaver then weaves the two sections together to create a unified whole. The ticlla technique can be traced as far back as the Chavin culture, and was especially important to the Paracas and Nazca who created stunning textiles solely with ticlla. The technique is unique to the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru, and cannot be found anywhere else in the world.For decades modern scholars believed that ticlla was but another unique Andean technique that had been lost to time. After beginning investigative work with the Pitumarca association, elders revealed that they still knew how to weave ticlla. Since then elders have taught younger generations, and Pitumarca is now the only community in Peru that continues to weave with ticlla.\n\n\n=== Santa Cruz de Sallac ===\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Watay de Santa Cruz de Sallac\"\nCommunity: Santa Cruz de Sallac\nDistrict: Urcos\nProvince: Quispicanchis\nRegion: Cusco\nSanta Cruz de Sallac is located approximately two and a half hours to the south of the city of Cusco high in the mountains above the regional town of Urcos. Urcos is a market town where highways meet and merchants sell products from the Andes mountains as well as the Amazon jungle. Santa Cruz de Sallac is located on the opposite side of the valley from the highway that leads to Puerto Maldonado and the Amazon jungle.There is a sense of community in Santa Cruz de Sallac and weavers focus on community organization and assisting each other. The weaving association is very well-organized. There are approximately 45 adult weavers and 20 children in the Santa Cruz de Sallac weaving association. The association partnered with the CTTC in 2005.Weavers in the Santa Cruz de Sallac association are unique in the Cusco region for their use of embroidery to create their designs. While they also weave patterns in the ley (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the watay (ikat) technique. In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, where he or she tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this warp. The unwrapped sections of warp thread are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed. After dyeing, the weaver unwraps the sections of wrapped warp. When the weaver mounts this warp on their loom and weaves it as plain weave, the dyed and undyed sections form a design. Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in Peru that still maintains the watay technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the Nazca and Huari cultures.\n\n\n=== Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas) ===\nAssociation: \"Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres Artesanas 'Surphuy' de Chumbivilcas\"\nCommunity: Santo Tomas\nDistrict: Santo Tomas\nProvince: Chumbivilcas\nRegion: Cusco\nSanto Tomas is the capital of the Chumbivilcas province and is located eight hours southwest from the city of Cusco. The Santo Tomas weaving center is located in the capital, but weavers from the surrounding province travel into the small city to participate. Santo Tomas is located on a high rolling plain and is known for its horseback riding tradition and cattle herds. As communities and homes are spread far apart over the rolling plains and hills, people traditionally rely on their horses for transportation. Many local festivals and traditions are based around horseback riding, and traditional clothing reflects this in the use of leather chaps, spurs, and other riding equipment.The Santo Tomas weaving association partnered with CTTC in 2007. Today approximately 20 adults and 15 children are members of the Santo Tomas weaving association. Before working with the CTTC, members of this association used acrylic yarn and chemical dyes in their textiles. After an arduous process, the weavers now use natural dyes and natural sheep wool.The textile tradition of Santo Tomas reflects their unique horseback riding tradition. Wide designs in the doble cara (complementary warp) technique often reflect horses or horses with riders. Women's traditional clothing is distinguished by bold reverse appliqu\u00e9 designs in black velvet over satin-like fabrics in bright reds, blues, and greens, making traditional dress from Santo Tomas highly distinct from other Cusco communities. Both women and men wear boots for horseback riding, while men wear elaborate leather leggings and spurs.\n\n\n== Education department ==\nThe mission of the CTTC's Education Department is to \"provide an interactive space between weavers and the public through programs, investigations, and publications that promote the revaluation of ancestral textiles.\" The vision of the Education Department is \"To achieve a future where Peruvian textile culture is valued as a global patrimony.\" The Education Department at the CTTC runs educational events for the weavers, the young weavers and the general public, as well as managing the museum Weaving Lives, the permanent collection of textiles, the library on textile sources, the design catalogue, investigations and publications, classes for visitors, visual materials and the volunteer program.\n\n\n=== The Young Weaver Groups ===\nEach of the ten weaving associations works with a youth group called the Young Weaver Group. These are children and adolescents between the ages of six and thirty who are learning the textile traditions of their community. The CTTC places emphasis on the young weavers as they will be responsible for carrying on traditions in the future. The Young Weaver Groups began in Chinchero in the 1990s. Since then, each community has organized a youth group. Elder weavers work with the children to teach them designs and techniques. The Education Department organizes various activities for the young weavers each year, including: gatherings of young weavers, weaving competitions, classes on ancient textiles of Peru, field trips to local museums, and more.\n\n\n=== Museum \"Weaving Lives\" ===\nLocated on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Per\u00fa, the museum Weaving Lives details the backstrap weaving process, unique Peruvian textile techniques, traditional uses of textiles in the Andes, as well as traditions and practices associated with textiles. Opened to the public in 2001, the small museum presents five rooms that display textiles, photography, and text in Spanish and English.\n\n\n=== The CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles ===\nSince its founding in 1996, the CTTC has developed a unique ethnographic collection of traditional textiles from the Andes that include: examples of the traditional clothing from each of the ten communities, examples of the rudimentary textiles made before the CTTC's investigative work, exemplary textiles created after the CTTC's investigative work, pieces from the annual competition \"Weaver Awards,\" amongst others. Pieces from the CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles have been displayed in local and international exhibits.\n\n\n=== CTTC Library ===\nThe CTTC maintains a small library of textile sources, used for investigative work with the weavers and visiting scholars. Much of the replication work completed by the weavers of the CTTC is conducted through reference to textual sources.\n\n\n=== The CTTC Design Catalogue ===\nEach community maintains a unique repertoire of designs that represent their history and culture. Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to create a reference catalogue for each community that documents every design as well as each design variation.\n\n\n=== Investigations and Publications ===\nThrough extensive investigative work with the elders of each community, the CTTC works to recover ancient designs, techniques, and styles that were on the brink of being lost to time. The Center has published a number of articles, books and DVDs based on its efforts, including:\n\nWeaving Lives: Traditional Textiles of Cusco, Preserving the Textile Tradition, published in 2005 by the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco\nWeaving in the Peruvian Highlands: Dreaming Patterns, Weaving Memories, published in 2007 by Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez\nTextile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage, published in 2012 by Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez\nFaces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes, published in 2013 by Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez and Christine Franquemont\n\n\n=== The Weaver Awards ===\nSince 2006 CTTC has partnered with Culture Explorers to offer the 'Weaver Awards,' an annual weaving competition, to the ten weaving associations that partner with CTTC. The Weaver Awards inspire the weavers to unite their efforts to create exceptional pieces that are inducted into the CTTC's Permanent Collection of textiles or that are acquired by international collectors and museums. The Weaver Awards help provide additional income to impoverished communities while encouraging excellence in the textile arts.\n\n\n=== Textile Classes ===\nThe CTTC offers four courses on traditional Andean textiles: spinning, backstrap weaving, knitting, and sling braiding. Each course is one to three days in length, except for the knitting course which is only offered for a full three days. The classes are private and teach the basic skills of spinning with a drop spindle, weaving on a backstrap loom, knitting in the Chinchero style, and braiding ropes and slings from Pitumarca. The CTTC's policy concerning the teaching of traditional techniques is a balance between educating the public and respecting the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples. The CTTC offers up to three days of instruction in traditional techniques, as this time frame is enough for students to gain respect for the complex, millennia old techniques. The CTTC does not offer more than three days of class time, as this would risk compromising the intellectual property rights of the indigenous weavers it works with.\n\n\n=== The CTTC Volunteer Program ===\nThe CTTC offers two volunteer positions, Education Department Volunteers and Project Volunteers. In the Education Department volunteers assist with various projects and events run for the weavers and the public. Project Volunteers work on unique projects in support of the CTTC.\n\n\n== The sales and marketing department ==\nThe Sales & Marketing Department promotes the sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's textile art. The Sales & Marketing Department manages five physical store locations, as well as an online catalogue. The main CTTC store, which sells woven textiles, is located on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Peru. Directly next door to its main store, the CTTC runs a small knitwear store. Besides the main two stores on Av Sol, the Sales and Marketing Department runs a small museum shop in Museo Inka and another museum shop in Museo de Arte Precolombino, both located in the historic center of Cusco. The fifth CTTC store is located at the weaving complex in the community of Chinchero. The CTTC also exports to stores and companies located in the USA and Canada.The sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's work has been the main contributing factor in improving the quality of life of member weavers. With improved income, families are able to send their children to school, access better health care, and make improvements to their homes. Women have been provided with independent incomes from their male relatives, which has improved their standing in community life.\n\n\n=== Products ===\nThe CTTC offers traditional textiles as well as modern products created in various techniques including: backstrap weaving, knitting, and rope braiding. Each piece is made with natural alpaca, sheep or llama fiber and dyed with natural plant and animal dyes. Each item is authored and includes a photo of the artist, their birthdate, and their community. Traditional textiles offered by the CTTC include: lliklla (blankets), ponchos, unkuna (a cloth to carry coca leaves), chumpi (belts), jakima (small ribbons), slings, and chullo (knitted hats), amongst others. Non-traditional products offered by the CTTC include: wall hangings and wall art, home decor, bags and purses, accessories, and modern clothing items, amongst others.\n\n\n== Special Projects ==\nBesides the Education Department and the Sales & Marketing Department, the CTTC runs a number of special projects that seek to revive textile traditions in the Cusco region.\n\n\n=== Natural dyes ===\nSince 1999, the CTTC has been the leader in the Cusco region in the revival of natural dyes. Weavers from the community of Chinchero, led by Nilda Calla\u00f1aupa Alvarez, held investigations with elders, attended international workshops and conferences, and conducted many experiments before reviving the natural dyeing process in the Cusco region. The CTTC is recognized internationally as the main force in reviving natural dyeing in the Cusco region where today many weavers once more use ancient dyes once practiced by their ancestors. Natural dyes revived by the CTTC include:\n\nAnil (indigo) - Indig\u00f3fera suffruticosa, familia Fabaceae - produces all shades of blue from light to dark\nChaphi (Palo Palo) - Galium aparine, familia Rubiaceae - produces a light shade of pink or peach\nChecchi - Berberis carinata, familia Berberidaceae - produces shades of yellow\nCh'illka - Baccharis caespitosa, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of green\nCochineal - Dactylopius coccus, familia Dactylopiidae - produces shades of red, pinks, purples and oranges depending on what mordant is used in the dye vat\nKiku - Bidens andicola, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow\nQ'olle - Budleja coriaceae, familia Loganiaceae - produces shades of yellow and orange when mixed with cochineal\nKinsa k'uchu - Baccharis genistelloides, familia Asteraceae - produces a light shade of turquoise. Note, it is a black fungus on the leaf Kinsa kuchu that produces the dye, not the leaf itself.\nMolle - Sichinus molle, familia Anacardiaceae - produces shades of yellow\nMot'e - Vaccinium floribundum, familia Ericaceae -produces shades of burgundy\nNogal (walnut) - Juglans neotropica, familia juglandaceae - produces shades of brown\nQ'aq'a sunkha - Usnea barbata, familia Usneaceae - produces shades of dark orange to brown\nTayanka - Baccharis buxifolia, familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow to lime green\n\n\n=== The Indigo Project ===\nThe strain of indigo found in pre-Columbian textiles is native to South America. After investigations and a long revival process, the CTTC establish a small plantation in the community of Huayro where it farms approximately five acres of native Indig\u00f3fera suffruticosa plants. Indigo is the only plant in the world that produces blue dye. The process of extracting the dye from the leaves of the plant is long and laborious. After harvesting, leaves must be oxidized in large vats of water that are left to evaporate. The resultant mixture is then heated to remove remaining excess water and produce a hard cake of indigo dye. This dye is later mixed with human urine and left to ferment underground with the yarn for a month to produce the dyed yarn. The CTTC's Indigo Project seeks to maintain the unique strain of indigo native to South America, and serves to educate the public about the importance of natural dyes.\n\n\n=== Replica Work ===\nThe CTTC is known internationally for its work in replicas of Pre-Columbian and Colonial textiles. The CTTC's replica projects include, amongst others: \n\nThe Juanita Mummy - working jointly with Dr Bill Conklin, Jose Antonio Chavez (director of the Museo Santuarios Andinos at the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa), and National Geographic, weavers from the CTTC traveled to Arequipa to analyze the textiles of the Juanita Mummy, discovered by Johan Reinhard in 1995 on the Ampato Mountain above Arequipa. CTTC weavers replicated the lliklla (blanket), axsu (dress), and chumpi (belt), of the mummy after a laborious investigative process to determine the techniques and designs of the textiles. Chinchero weaver Carolina Concha W. comments that \"When we went to the museum we wanted to open the showcase where 'Juanita' was exhibited, to touch, see and examine the designs. It was hard to see, and it was frozen. To replicate the designs was very difficult. We tried again and again until we thought that it might not have been woven in our style of warp-faced weaving. With great effort, the designs started to show, and I felt so excited! We discussed all kinds of commentaries and jokes, like Juanita didn't want us to replicate her designs and her textiles, but we did. I know that  for some of us, it is still impossible to replicate the designs, but we feel very proud of weaving the heritage of our Incan textile.\"\nThe poncho of Jose de San Martin - Contacted by an associate of the Museo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Buenos Aires \u2013 Argentina, where the original piece is housed, weavers from the CTTC replicated the poncho of Jose de San Martin in complementary warp faced weave.\nThe poncho of Simon Bolivar - Contacted by the director of the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia del Per\u00fa, weavers from the CTTC realized a replica of the poncho of Simon Bolivar.\n\n\n=== Tinkuy: Gathering of the Textile Arts ===\nTinkuy is an international textile conference organized by CTTC approximately every three years starting in 2010. Tinkuy gathers together indigenous weavers, textile artists, anthropologists, art historians and textile enthusiasts. The conference is composed of lectures, presentations, workshops, demonstrations and other events. The next Tinkuy is scheduled for November 2017. During Tinkuy indigenous textile artists from across the world meet to share and celebrate their textile traditions.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Nice place to spend some of your time. Not large, but helpful in explaining some of the weaving history.",

          "The shopping was fine and if you are not going to Lima or Aguas Calientes this might be your best bet, but the prices were steep for the rest of the country. They are not steep by American/European standards (no shopping anywhere in Peru was).",

          "If you're determined to buy traditional textiles, this is the only place to do so because of the variety and quality available. Prices were not a bargain by any stretch - in the range that you might expect to pay in a high end import shop. The majority of items were table",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "This trip was a good way to dive into the Inca culture. We had a Quechuan guide, Rosi, which made the trip extra special. Be prepared for harsh toilet situation, but please honor the environment and don't go in the woods. 500 people per day on the Inca trail, so there is lots",
          "The most amazing thing I've ever done! I trained for it and it paid off, yes the hills/stairs were tough but not unbearable. I would do it again in a heart beat. There were even more bathrooms along the trail than I had expected, although I did have to use the \"Inca\" bathroom a",

          "I hiked the Inca trail with alpaca Expeditions in the month of November of 2018. this was the end of the main hiking season in Peru. This is considered to be the beginning of the rainy season in Peru. About a third of the time that I hiked I did so in drizzle or constant rain.",
          "Do it, Do it. Do it. there are great sites, ruins along the way and if you have a good guide some interesting history. Note day 3 was hard, up and down a zillion steps.",
          "If you are on a one day trek along the Inca Trail, it is wise to engage the services of a guide. The view is breathtaking including the ascent. You will see great flora and fauna and occasional birds. When you look down, you see the raging Urubamba river. Before you reach the",

          "The Inca Trail provides a great mix of hiking, amazing views, and visits to numerous grand scale Inca ruins along the way. The hiking is mainly a man made rock path with alot of stairs... up and down and can get slick when it rains. The altitude change can be pretty",
          "Not for everyone if you are not reasonably fit but otherwise it is extraordinarily satisfying to complete. Don\u2019t expect it to be clear to take a pic of Machu Picchu when you get there, but there are many unique pics along the way that the folks who take a bus will never have.",
          "It\u2019s tough but rewarding. Make sure you\u2019re both physically and mentally ready for the challenge. Choose a reputable company to go with.",

          "If you can, do it! The view you have of Machu Picchu from the Puerta del Sol after the hike is priceless. During the hike we saw a lot of wild orchids, and beautiful views. It is a moderate hike, hiking shoes are recommended.",
          "They talk about Altitude Sickness. I can tell you it sure does exist altbough it doesn't stay around for long. Best advice arrive 1/2 days before .. its imperative to acclimatize and dont worry you fill in your day with short walks around Cuzco. Only sorry we didn't have more",
          "We took Inca Rail to Machu Picchu from Cusco. Service was very good. Really nice trip. Enjoy it. Recommend !",
          "This is a tough hike but worth it!!! If you have bad knees (like me), I would highly suggest walking sticks. There are a lot of stairs/steps to traverse but this \"old lady\" survived.",
          "An amazing experience, a day of walk with history and beauty. Jose our guide was amazing, knowledgeable and really friendly. The views were amazing, arriving to Puerta del Sol was really emotional, the view of Machu Picchu from here was amazing. What an amazing experience.",

          "The Inca Trail has so much history. We took many pictures along the breathtaking landscapes along our tour. A must do!",
          "The 4 day 3 night trek is hard but worth it. We did get 4 seasons in one day when we travelled in late Sept - so be prepared. It is not the hiking that gets you - it is the altitude that makes it hard going.",
          "This was a beautiful and challenging trail. We did the 4 day hike to Machu Picchu and loved it! So much beauty, an incredible experience. Several people in our group did no training to prepare and they really struggled. The inclines can be quite relentless, and the declines are",
          "Hiking the 4 day excursion is a life changing experience not to be taken lightly. Be in good physical shape and prepare to reach deeply inside to find strength. Keep a slow pace to absorb all of the beauty, history, and spirituality of this area and its people.",
          "We did a two-day hike on the Inca Trail and found it to be very beautiful with lush nature, waterfalls, orchids and fascinating sights on the way. We can absolutely recommend hiking instead of taking the bus to Machu Picchu. The hike is for fitter people though as it goes pretty",
          "Mountain View. Quite trek. Moderate walking. Nice pictures of view. Very expensive (including the rail, entering the trail and entering Machu-Picchu) - 430$.",
          "My husband (60) & I (55) did the 4 day Inca Trail with Intrepid, we had female guide & a male assistant guide , 12 porters & 1 cook. Five people in our group. What an experience , views spectacular, hiking was very strenuous but so well worth it, almost ethereal or spiritual .",
          "A challenge even for the physically and mentally fit. Not to be underestimated (as we did!) - but it came after the Salkantay (or High Inca) Trail, so was a bit of an easing back into normal life. We tend to forget the benefits of 21% Oxygen, until it is no longer available!",
          "We had read reviews and trip reports, but nothing prepares you for what you are about to experience. The trail takes you through amazing scenery and history - you can't go far without seeing Inca ruins that the bus loads of tourists at Macchu Pichu simply do not get to",

          "Trekking this trail has two effects: ONE is the test of your own stamina and willpower,; TWO is total submersion in the history and beauty of a unique, ancient environment. This trail is not easy - even for experienced trekkers. But everyone on the trail cheers on every other",

          "The key to the Inca Trail is choosing a tour company that fits you. In my case, as a 61 year old woman, Road Scholar was perfect. The campsite locations they chose allowed for more leisurely days where I could take photos and not feel rushed. I'm fit and had nothing to prove",
          "An absolutely wonderful experience. Great weather, great views, excellent accommodations, an abundance of really good food, best guides ever; Joseph, Gillbert and Juan, and not to be forgotten our fellow trekkers. We had a blast",
          "This is not a trek for beginners. Train long and hard. There are lots of stone steps both up and down. All of it is done at altitudes in excess of 10,000 feet. The first day is the \"easy\" day you trek from 8700 feet (starting point) to 10,137 feet in about 4 hours. The second",
          "This trip certainly tests you...long days of hiking, early mornings after sleeping in tents in the rain. But the reward is not only earning the sight of Machu Picchu in the early morning, but the journey itself through cloud forest, rain forest, past incredible Inca ruins.",

          "The Inca Trail was amazing but very difficult and I haven't found where anyone else felt like I did about it. During the hike, I was miserable and it wasn't fun. It was HARD. My husband and I decided to do this hike and I'm not sure why. We started working with a personal",

          "The Inca trail trek to Machu Picchu was incredibly challenging but also incredibly rewarding. Walking the same path that the Incan people did hundreds of years ago makes visiting Machu Picchu so much more meaningful.",
          "If you do one thing in your life and you are physically fit, this is it. You will always cherish this one. It is as challenging as it is rewarding. You will want it to end and go on forever at the same time. Amazing. And you have to use alpaca expeditions. The best",
          "fantastic trek for 4 days to machu picchu. Awesome porters doing your work, cook fabulous meals given the conditions. Toilets not the best, but hey suck it up because it is so worth it.",
          "My wife and I are 67 and 71 years old. The day hike from KM 104 on the rail line was about all we could handle, but it was spectacular and we are so glad we did not miss it.",
          "We really enjoyed our trip on the Inca Trail. We hiked it over 4 days. It is physically demanding and I don't think we understood just HOW demanding the hike would be before we set off. One really should be able to hike, with a 10# or so day pack, up and down by 1,000 - 1,500",
          "I did the Short Inca Trail and it was a great experience! The hike is not challenging, but you still need to be in good shape to complete the 6 hour hike. I am so glad I did this hike, as you arrive to Machupicchu via the Sun Gate.",
          "Incredible scenery all the way. Walking at high altitude is sometimes breathless, but the porters, chefs and guides carry everything for you and make you feel like royalty. Waking about 6 hours a day for 4 days, but time flies - there is always something to see. I can\u2019t",
          "How incredible to follow in the footsteps of such an amazing civilization. One can see why this place is so sacred, it moves one emotionally to think of the feats accomplished by the Incas in their time.",
          "The only way to see Machu Picchu is to earn it with a 3 or 4 day hike. You will be challenged, you will see beautiful sites and sights, you will spend time in nature.. it was hard, but completely worth it. Choose a reputable company that will respect and care for the porters.",
          "Absolutely worth the hard work of walking up the mountain! this is the best way to arrive at machu pichu - from above, and after laboring a bit. Absolutely beautiful trail with entrancing views. No words to describe how the view on Machi pichu is... just unique!",
          "We did the 4 day/3 night trek with Alpaca Expeditions. It was amazing, challenging and we all made it!",
          "Llama Path is the company I used and they did a fantastic job. This is a tough hike so be pepaired. Go hike soon mountains and get into better shape. elevation is close to 14k feet up. Don\u2019t forget to stop and look at the views.",
          "We did the four day Inca Trail, our porters and guide were booked with Wayki they did a great job! The trail is different each day different challenges and always something interesting to see the scenery is incredible. Make sure you layer your clothing as the temperature varies",
          "What a fantastic 4 days hiking into Machu Picchu. Stunning views along a well worn path with ruins along the way. Setting out from Ollantaytambo in the heart of Inca territory, the walk is a steady and challenging one but one that stays in memories of Peru. Fabulous, so pleased",
          "One of the best trails to hike, sweeping vistas, Urubamba river, the Andes , the cool , crisp air, the panaromas. you'll fall in love with nature and yourself just because you are able to visit this place.",
          "My friend and I did the 2D/1N version as we aren\u2019t hikers nor campers... we were quite exhausted afterwards but it was well worth it. Get your altitude sickness prevention pills and work out in advance!",
          "You cannot describe this in a review. We had friends who did other tours and the scenery just didn't compare to the classic trail. It was clean and not very busy. You visit mini 'machu-picchus' on the way and every turn is breathtaking. Simply the best and most challenging thing",
          "What can I say, not to be missed, but really, really, hard. The altitude makes what should be an easy walk into a very difficult walk, particularly day 2. Make sure you train before you go, and be prepared for basic camping.",
          "This is an excellent trek with a reasonable degree difficulty. Weather can be a bit unpredictable. Follow the advice of your company for clothing suggestions and be prepared. Training beforehand will make the experience much more enjoyable.",
          "There are lots to see on this trek from Cusco to Machu Picchu. Be prepared for the gigantic changes in the elements, as you will experience cold temperatures on snowy mountains and tropical temperatures and weather in tropical rainforests. From the heights to the valleys,",
          "Bucket-list worthy experience! Did the 4-day hike over the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and then hiked up Huayna Picchu! Loved every minute!",
          "Amazing architecture along the trail. Inca ruins were intact and told an tale of strength and resolve.",
          "Challenging trek to get the most incredible view of Machu Picchu form the Sun Gate. Be in shape if you're going to do this. If you're not, take the train to Aguas Clients.",
          "My son and I completed the 4 day Inca trail May 12, 2018. There is no question that the Inca trail is the most amazing trail in the world. Do not be naive and think it is just another trail and will be easy to complete, without question this was the most difficult physical",
          "Exquisite views, vigorous hike (2 day hike of Inca trail), magnificent vistas. Well worth the effort!",
          "The inca trail was actually better than Machu Picchu. Would highly recommend using Llama Path for a guide service.",
          "This 4 day trek 3 night camp felt very rushed could have done with it spread over another day, too rushed to really appreciate the scenery, but an amazing adventure none the less",
          "This trip was truly amazing!! The nature, guidning, service and food(!!) was unbelievable! I recommend it strongly! And especially with our guide named Diego, he knew everything and everyone! He was very funny as well!",
          "Our family of four did the one day hike on the Inca Trail getting dropped off the train at mile marker 104 and hiking up and up to Machu Picchu. You start at the river (we took the early train at 7 am from Ollantaytambo) around 830 and cross the river to a ranger station to",
          "The Inka trail has been on our bucket list for a while and I am now glad to say that we have done it. We done the four day hike with Intrepid travel. We were well looked after every step of the way. From the minute we meet our guide and assistant guide we were fully informed",
          "Probably one of the greatest things I've done in my life! It was not easy but it was TOTALLY worth it! Don't forget to have plenty of water, protein bars and coca leaves with you and make sure you wear comfy clothes/ shoes because you will experience different climates and paths",
          "The Inca Trail is always highly rated as a hike and it totally lives up to the hype. You hike through four different microclimates and pass several Incan Ruins. It's truly an unforgettable trip.",
          "This is a fabulous trail to walk! We just undertook the day trail up to Machu Picchu. It was the hardest thing that I have ever done and I am a fit person but if you don't do it you will be disappointed. At the end viewing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate is a vista that will",

          "I did the 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. I think the words, or even pictures, fall short to describe the beauty of this place. Because of this, I will focus on the things that might help you to enjoy 100% this place. The trail: It has aprox. 43km in length. The longest",
          "I am not of the age anymore where I want to be sleeping out on the trail for the 4 day hike into Machu Picchu. But I highly recommend the one day hike from Km 104. Find a guide and go. It's a hard hike at elevation but the feeling of elation when hiking over the Sun Gate and",
          "We did the 2 day Inca trail hike. It was something I am thrilled to say I completed. It is not for the faint hearted. I had no idea how many steps I would be climbing. As a 50 something mom, I have to admit I needed help from my husband carrying my pack at times. We used",
          "Whew. It was Tough! My husband and I hiked it and it took eight hours from the trail head to Machu Picchu. We are in our mid fifties, so age and the altitude took its toll. However, we completed the hike and it was worth every ounce of pain and suffering to see Machu Picchu.",
          "Four days of jawdropping views going up and down and up and down the Andes, with the occasional \"Peruvian flat\" (less up and down) ... it's tough, Day 2 is a test, as is the first leg of Day 3. Was really rewarding arriving at Machu Picchu. Don't think about it. Do it. Just be",
          "We only did a small chunk but it was completely worth it. The chunk we did was from Machu Picchu to the dead end. The incredible views made us want to do more of the trail at some later point in life.",
          "I didn't have time for a full 4-day excursion, so my tour company arranged a one-day version starting from KM104, where we deboarded the train to begin. The views were amazing, the trail is not technically difficult, but pretty strenuous, even for someone kind of in shape.",
          "The experienced of a life time!! If your are considering hiking the Inca Trail, do it. Just be sure you properly train and prep your body for the altitude.",
          "Arriving into Machu Picchu is soooo much better when you arrive via the Inca Trail. Although it is challenging most people will be able to complete this. Dead Woman's pass is the most challenging part and once you are past that it is reasonably straightforward.",
          "We absolutely loved our time with local Salkantay Trekkers Peru - doing the 4D-3N classical Inca Trail with them. We felt this was an excellent company to choose to do the famous trek to Machupicchu with, and we liked that it is owned by local people (rather than just a large",
          "We literally hopped off the train at KM 104 with our amazing guide, Sara, who was introduced to us by our fabulous travel agent, Intense Peru. The start to the day was cool and a little moist. In no time we were climbing and removing layers as we began the 15+km (9-10 mike)",
          "We took the train to walk the Inca Trail. There was a lot of climbing steps to make it to Machu Picchu. It was a great experience with many wonderful sights along the trail. Well worth the effort!",

          "I'm 63 and in pretty good health/shape - pilates a couple times a week and hiking a couple times a week. I knew hiking the Inca Trail would be a challenge.....and it was. And it was worth it! I had a very slow pace (La Tortuga) but was able to minimize rest stops. I was",
          "There are a few Ica trails and we did the Salkantay pass and 4 day Ince trail. Amazing views and definitely worth doing!",
          "The tour of the Inca Trail is a once in a lifetime experience. From the unspoiled beauty of the landscape to the challenge of climbing ancient rock stairs built by the Incan's this trip will be one that you will look back on fondly.",
          "This truly is the only way to see Machu Picchu - by the time you arrive, you truly understand the significance and the journey. If you are in good physical shape, you should definitely make the trek versus taking the train.",
          "We hiked the Inka Trail as a family (50 something parents and their 2 kids in their 20s). I was a little worried because I'm not a backpacker. We trained by hiking some hills near our house and incline work on the treadmill. I'm in shape but not an athlete. I can honestly",
          "The Inca Trail was an amazing experience and one that I would definitely recommend if you enjoy hiking. Whilst it was easier than I expected, it definitely wasn't easy and does unfortunately depend on whether you are unlucky enough to be affected by altitude sickness although",
          "Amazing trail, trek could be hard if not mentally and physically prepared to take on the challenge of high altitude.",
          "Very hard trail . There is no other way to see some of the ruins and areas before reaching Machu Picchu. The landscape is tough to walk on , but if you enjoy hiking and camping and are in good physical shape, you should do this.",
          "Even if we go daily to the gym and love hiking, this was by far the toughtest hike we did in our entire life. The altitude makes it difficult but we were acclimatized thanks to the short alternative Rainbow Mountain hik and Sacred Valley visit we did two days before. Arriving in",
          "Staff was amazing. They answered all my questions. We would up doing only the shorter tour so I would take them again on a longer one.",
          "I did the Inca trail from KM 108. It was defiantly a hard and hot trek but the scenery along the way is breathtaking! You also get to see some other Inca ruins that you wouldn't have seen if you went directly to Machu Picchu. Highly recommend doing the Inca trail!",
          "4 days trekking on the trail, well worth it. Learnt about \u201cPeruvian flat\u201d which is undulating landscape. Day 2 - dead woman\u2019s pass was the greatest ascent and a hard slog up, but worth it when you reach the top, we were actually above the clouds looking down. Day 3 had a lot of",

          "We did a five-mile section of the Inca Trail starting in Chinchero and hiked the descending trail down to Urquillos. Such an amazing experience! The trail descends pretty steeply at first. Walking sticks are recommended. Much better to be hiking downhill than up!",
          "Seems there are two basic ways to get to Machu Picchu (MP) - bus from Aquas Calientas or hike. And there are many hikes because there are many Inka trails. Common one is 4 day trek, but there are some 1-day options. We did a 1 day hike from a Peru Rail stop short of Aquas.",
          "Stunning, challenging and worth the effort! No photograph can come close to what you will experience. The food on the trail is excellent. Manny and Jorge were fantastic guides and the porters were terrific.",
          "We did the two tour/hike from point 106. Not for the weak or Un-fit as it is a steep uphill hike and with altitude and heat, it is hard. Well worth it when you see Macchi Picchu!",
          "Truly a bucket list adventure. Breathtaking hike through the Andes and history. Almost none of this trek is flat. First day is easiest. Second day is the potential killer, mostly uphill as you ascend to Dead Woman's Pass. BTW, its named for the appearance of a rock formation;",
          "We have hiked all over the world and nothing compared to this hike. You need to be in fairly good shape. It is 45 kilos going from 7500 to 14000 ft (Dead Woman's pass). We took 4 days. We had guides, porters, chefs, etc. Still a hard hike but worth every painful step. Many",
          "Breathtaking, worth the effort, high altitude so make sure you have plenty water. Guides are very hlpful, restaurants along teh way are simple but friendly and worth the stop. Did I remember to tell you to drink plenty of water? Good shoes would be wise, no flip flops or",

          "Did the Inca trail from Aguas Calientes to machupicchu pueblo, with a tour company the hike was tough at times but the views were so worth it a great lifetime experience! There is a plenty activities along thenway,from zip lining trough hot springs in colcamyo to white water",

          "This was a great time of year to do the Inca Trail. I went with Peru Treks who was an awesome company and I'd highly recommend them! end of March was a great time of year to go. We had great weather except the 3rd day which rained on us but we were prepared for it with ponchos!",

          "It's an adventure and is worth the effort. The sights and sounds along the way make the journey probably as enjoyable as reaching Machu Picchu. It's worth putting some effort into getting into shape prior to the trip and having the right stuff, but a positive attitude and",
          "The trail is a must for all that truly want to experience peruvian nature and history and have the strenght to do it. It is not an easy hike, it gets draining day after day, with sleeping in tents and eating in weird times. But the views are amazing!!! A few tips: check the",

          "There are few things that take your breath away as does the Inka Trail. The hike itself passes by beautiful spots and then arriving at the Sun Gate to get to see Machu Picchu as a reward cannot be described in words. One has seen it so many times in pictures or documentaries but",
          "Very demanding trek, especially day 2. Fantastic scenery and great experience but difficult if you are not used to the altitude. Need all the right clothing and footwear. This is no walk in the park. Porters on this trek deserve a medal. Not for the faint hearted or those who",
          "We were in a group of 10 walkers who were all relatively fit and able to cope with the rigours of the trip. The hike takes four days with three nights sleeping on the trail in tents. The sleeping bags and mattresses provided were excellent and we were very comfortable. We",

          "Did the 2 day Inca Trail. I found the trek very tough and the views great. The first day from 104 KM stop off the train is the beginning of a 15 kilometer trek up the mountain to Sun Gate and then down to the Machu Picchu site.",
          "Firstly let us say that this is not an easy trek, it is though amazing , breathtaking and worth every step! the 4 day /3 night trek is as incredible as the arrival at Macchu Picchu itself. A moderate level of fitness is required , it is not a race! There are many people with a",
          "If you are physically able, this is a true bucket list item! The altitude is rough and the thousands of steps are painful on the knees, especially going down. But, you will see things that other, more conventional travelers will not see.",

          "We had a wonderful 4 Day Inca Trail trek with Uncover Latin America, they were amazing, our guide, porters and the cooks were all excellent, the food was delicious and we got big meal portions. Not an easy trek, we found it challenging, I guess because of the altitude but it",
          "Do the trek with Freddy and you won't regret it. The trek is more impressive than Machu Picchu itself. Not for the faint of heart though",
          "Expect to spend $600-$800 for hiking, when there are similar free hikes all around. Machu Picchu is in the middle of a group of beautiful mountains and the Inca Trail is the main one pushed by tour groups and taxed by the government. Save your money and skip the crowds by",
          "We didn't do the whole trail but started at mile marker 106. For a group of 65ish seniors, it was challenging enough. It requires conditioning and we were tired when we finished but it was the highlight of our trip.",
          "I trekked a portion of the Inca Trail with a guide and so glad I did. The vistas were amazing and all the beautiful vegetation along the way was gorgeous. It was tough as the terrain was rough, rocky and steep. Throw in high altitude and this trek is not for everyone, however",
          "The Inca Trail hike is definitively not for the novice hiked. The trails could be very steep, uneven, slippery, long, and high into the clouds. The rewards are serenity, hiking in the cloud forest, amazing views of the Andes, you're in the Andes, and you say to yourself, \"if I",
          "The Inca Trail is truly a once in a lifetime trek, and we approached it as such by meticulously planning for the best weather in the driest months. The best laid pans.... Just a friendly reminder to everyone that mother nature doesn't play by any rules, and while May averages",

          "We took the 2 day / 1 night trek; it was incredible. The first part of the trek is very steep, but rewarding; the ruins are an incredible experience. The view from the Sun Gate down into Machu Picchu itself is spectacular. Note about footwear - the trail is steep and mostly",
          "We were so looking forward to this trek for so long. Make sure you book your trek at least 6 months in advance to ensure you get your permits, and make sure you book your trek through Uncover Latin America, they were brilliant. For those planning on doing this trek here\u00b4s some",
          "I think a lot has been said about the trail - what surprised me was the ruins and sights along the way. I also don't believe it is as difficult as most seem to think. It is hard but nothing that you cannot do.",
          "I did a 4d/3n inca trail hike to machu pichu. I went to Peru by myself but joined a group of about 15 people on this hike. All amazing people, and I had a great time on the hike. The weather in December can be a bit tricky. However we were really lucky with the weather. Except",

          "As hard and butt kicking the inca trail is it is the most special and memorable experience I have ever had. From the interaction with our group to the incredible views and ruins along the way I will never forget any of it. It will change you as a person and is truly an amazing",

          "Did the Incan trail in early May. The weather was good and clear for much of the trek, A bit of rain on the 2nd day after we passed dead woman's pass. Its a physically strenuous activity with up to 10 hours of treking in certain days, so be prepared. Make sure you acclimatize",
          "A group of 5 of us did the 4D/3N Inca Trail trek at the very end of April. Our group size ended up being 14 people total with one guide and one assistant guide. The whole hike was absolutely amazing!! Though the hike can be challenging at parts - it is definitely worth the",

          "If you are in reasonably good shape, this is such a worthwhile experience. If you have serious medical conditions or or you're not much of an athlete, I would not recommend it. Each day, you will hike around 8 miles. The hiking is relatively challenging and steep, both up and",

          "It was not easy.. but totally worth it. At the end you see machu picchu and its so worth it. All the people who get the bus to the end have no idea the great value you get from this hike. Go with peak adventures they give back to the community.",
          "It's challenging to be sure, but so worth it. I thought that Machu Picchu was going to be the highlight - the ultimate reward, but it turned out that the hike itself was the best part. Being able to visit several other spectacular Inca sites along the trail with no",
          "The Inca trail is not for the faint of heart. This is a difficult climb, but is worth every minute of it. The reward at the end is to enter Macchu Piccu through the Sun Gate.",
          "Although you can reach Machu Picchu by train, hiking the Inca Trail was definitely worth it. It\u2019s a once in a life time experience, where you can challenge yourself physically and emotionally. It\u2019s very well organized, and the work the guides and the staff do is amazing and a",
          "On the Inka trail you get so much more than Macchu Picchu. During the trek you will see several Inka ruins and you will get a good insight to the Inka culture that will add on to your experience at Macchu Picchu the last day. Being an experience hikers I will warn you - this is",

          "If you have the chance, and are physically able, I can't imagine a better way to arrive into Machu Picchu than trekking the Inca Trail. My family did a one day trek, and though it was a challenging hike, the sense of history and natural beauty make it worth the effort. The",
          "This is probably the most difficult, but at the same time, gratifying experience of my life. The second day is the most difficult but is doable. You need to train and pace yourself. The ruins and views are magnificent. Nothing prepares you to the magnificent site after you",
          "If at all possible take the Trek 2, 3, or four days. It is the way Machu Picchu was intended to be \"revealed.\" After significant exercise at high altitude, your lack of oxygen will make your \"discovery\" of MP magical. I'm 69 with some knee problems, but I worked out for two",

          "When they say the second day is the hardest, they absolutely mean it! Aside from that, it's an excellent trek that takes you past ruins that are far more accurate than Machu Picchu that's been re-touched to the point where it's an amusement park, crawling with tourists. The",
          "We went to Peru to complete the Inca Trail with G Adventures!! They are the only company I would recommend. It was one of the most difficult that we have ever completed but by far the most satisfying!! The tour through Sacred Valley is beautiful and much more to see. We spent 21",

          "An incredible 4 days and 3 nights along the Inca trail, full of ruins along the way before you reach the Sun Gate and Machu Picchu itself. As cliched as it sounds, it's almost the journey to get to Machu Picchu that is more impressive that the site itself! It's no picnic with",

          "In fact I did the trek in 2013 but it still the same. 360\u00b0 of mountains everywhere. The scenery change everyday. Prepare yourself for the second day because you'll have a steep climb",
          "The group i was with did the 25 mile Inca trail. Fascinating, challenging, beautiful and culturally/historically bountiful. It was the end of the rainy season so two days/nights of on off rain ocvurred but did not dampen our spirits. You do go as high as 14,200' so be prepared",
          "While a challenge, not as tough as I thought it was going to be. Day 2 up to nearly 14000' was the hardest part due lack of O2 at altitude. Plenty of beautiful scenery, and many Inca ruins on the way to get you ready for Machu Picchu. Recommend go with a local guide to explain",

          "We did the Inca Trail 2 day trip, 1 day hiking and 1 day in Machu Picchu. This is definitely the best way to make an entrance into Machu Picchu since you enter through the Sun Gate at the end of the hike. Amazing ruins along the way and beautiful views. The hike wasn't too",

          "We had spent all day touring the ruins outside Cusco and this sanctuary was by far my favorite! They took you on a tour with a guide telling interesting facts about the animals they have which was very interesting. We were able to get very close and personal with some amazing",
          "This place is a private zoo in the name of a non profit sanctuary. Same as the other reviewer, we have asked the owner about the release plan for the animals but it\u2019s the same answer \u201cthey are too injured to survive on their own outside\u201d. People need to be more aware of what",
          "As many have probably done, I did do initial research to make sure that this was a LEGIT sanctuary and happy home to the animals and not a tourist trap to take Instagram photos. I was happy with the results. You can tell that Albert and the volunteers care deeply about the",
          "I was in Peru and wanted to see a Andean Condor. I knew my chances of getting a glimpse of one in the wild would be unlikely. I heard of the sanctuary through our guide with Inca Experts and immediately added it to our itinerary. Being that it is run by a family with limited",
          "Visited this place but not so sure I feel great about it. None of these animals will be released into the wild as some of the reviews have mentioned. I noticed some animals, smaller animals, with neurotic Behavior or with no companionship (like the small feline animal). It's",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this animal sanctuary. The short tour of the facility was informative and interesting. We saw Llamas, camelids, alpacas, a bear, mountain cats, and the condors. The guide even coordinates a condor flight for visitors to witness. There is also a",

          "This small animal sanctuary rescues injured and abused native species, restores them to health, and restores them to the wild when possible. They have a dedicated staff, a really interesting program, and a great place to buy souvenirs. They do significant community and youth",
          "This animal sanctuary & rescue centre is well worth visiting en route from Cusco to Ollantaytambo. Animals & birds include spectacled bear, llamas, alpacas, puma, tortoise, condors. Good to see them close up. Centre has small caf\u00e9.",
          "We had a taxi take us from Cusco to the sanctuary and the driver waited for us for the 1.5 hours it took to fully enjoy this great place. Afterward, he took us on to Pisac, which made a great day trip (we caught a coletivo back to Cusco). The cost is 15 soles per adult (about",
          "Definitely a must see, must visit animal shelter paradise. My wife and me we stoped there on our way to Pisac. It is wonderful what the staff here does in terms of taking great care of rescued animals such as Pumas, Condors, Lamas, Alpacas, Monkeys and many more. We could feed",
          "This is a great place to visit to see the animals up close. The llamas and alpacas are domesticated, so you can go in and see them up close. The absolute highlight was, of course, the condors flying over your head. Incredible!!! Highly recommend!",
          "We stopped by here on our way from Cusco to Pisac (going on thereafter to the Sacred Valley) and this was a very worthwhile little stop. Less than an hour. We had an interesting guided tour from an enthusiastic volunteer and appreciated the work they are doing here for the",
          "This place was one of the highlights on my trip to Peru!! Absolutely loved it!! Plenty of animals to visit here from turtles to Puma's. I suggest that everyone stop in to see this place and help the animal's that they have rescued. You will find that each animal has their own",
          "There are several animals in the sanctuary and we were just happy to be able to help fund it through the entrance fee and by buying some souvenirs. We were able to interact with the llamas and alpacas, we even got to hug them! While you see them everywhere in Peru, we were able",
          "We were very lucky to have a very knowledgeable guide the day we visited the Animal Sanctuary on our way from Cusco to Urubamba in the Sacred Valley. This young man (a American working at the sanctuary for room and board) knew the names and stories of each animal which you are",
          "We went to the sanctuary on our tour of Peru. We seen pumas, condors, spectacled bears, coati, and other animals. Seeing the condors fly was amazing.",
          "This was part of our Sacred Valley tour and we enjoyed by visiting the animal santuary, the highlight was the seeing the condor!",
          "I find it difficult to rate this place, because on one hand they try to save abused animals and provide them a shelter. On the other hand the animals clearly don't have enough space and are kept in cages. So I can agree with reviews saying that it looks more like a zoo. It was",
          "Wow! What an amazing heart felt experience, the work and care these guys give to the animals is amazing! All the animals are rescued within Peru and they are also releasing the animals or birds back into the nature when possible like the endangered condors. These guys are",
          "This place made me so sad and upset. They keep those animals in very tiny cages and most of the birds were chained. The staffs say they \"rescued\" them from people who kept them as a pet. But this seems another horrible place for wild animals to be. The wild animals like condors,",
          "We really enjoyed our stop at the Santuario Animal de Cochahusai. Great to see so many animals well cared for. We were happy to contribute to a great cause.",
          "I signed up for a tour through an agency - I paid 50 soles for entrance, including private pickup at my hotel in Cusco and return (you can try to get your own taxi and pay the entrance fee separately and get it for a bit cheaper). The animals in the sanctuary are mostly local",
          "The owners and staff are very welcoming and friendly ! They give you a tour as if you were a visitor ( as if how you were expected to conduct the tour once you've settled.) You get your own script for when visitors arrive- which is often. The animals have their own appropriate",
          "This is not the place to visit if you care about animals, their wellbeing and way back to the wild after being \u201crescued\u201d. The main reason to our visit was to see how people in Peru helped injures spices form traffickers and brought them back to the wild after being treated from",
          "We stopped on our way from sacred valley to Cuzco. The tour is very informative. We came close to Condors, Pumas, All sorts of lamas and other animals needing special attention.",
          "After we left the city of Cusco with our guide to the Sacred Valley he mentioned that we would be stopping at an animal sanctuary. We just pulled over on the side of the road and we were there. It's private and we found out that they get no help from the government. They had",
          "It was our first time visiting an animal sanctuary and it was a little confronting when we first walked in but the staff were very friendly and encouraged us to join the English speaking tour. The guide, didn\u2019t catch her name coz we joined a few minutes late, was great. The tour",
          "The Animal Sanctuary was one of the stops on our Sam Travel Peru Sacred Valley Tour. This family-run private organization has been dedicated to saving abused, threatened and trafficked wildlife since 2007. You\u2019ll be able to get up close to local species such as the llama,",
          "Our guide recommended that we stop here on a full day tour of the Sacred Valley. I was skeptical as a lot of \"sanctuaries\" abroad seem to be little more than tourist traps and money making operations. The animals here are genuinely rescued from the tourism trade, from habitat",
          "While it's not large, it is right on the main road and easy to make a quick visit, have photo ops with llamas and alpacas and see some remarkable animals.",
          "good place to relax and enjoy in the free time, somthings one need natural places and it was amazing for mi, thanks for all.",
          "Such a great project on the road from Cusco to Pisac (Ccochawasi). You get a lot of information about the animals and the goals of the project.",
          "This is not a zoo, all the animals here came as injured or orphaned. They will be released if and when possible. They have large collection of Peruvian wildlife, this the only place where you can view these animals at close quarters. Highlight for me was the enormous aviary full",
          "Me and my girlfriend finished today our voluntary work. We are very happy with this Animal Sanctuary, the effort they make to help/rescue those animals is amazing, especially when you compare it to all other centers(and zoos) in Peru. I feel blessed that I went to this place.",
          "To *volunteer* We needed to pay money. The place sale feather of birds to make money. The shop sales coffee that hurts the animel (capis) Those make this place business of using the animels Group of 4 people volunteering for one day , the interaction with the animals is great",
          "Let me start off by saying that I\u2019m a HUGE animal lover and advocate. I never visit zoos unless they\u2019re rescues or sanctuaries. I was very very impressed with this one. The animals all looked healthy and happy. Enclosures were big enough to be comfortable. When I was there I saw",
          "Second visit here and it never fails to impress. It is so clean and tidy and they really do look after the animals so well. Small entrance fee and they do ask for a donation but it does go to all the hard walk that they do here. You can have a guide and they speak good English",
          "Many rescued animals to see including the rare speckled bear. Love being able to pet and take pictures with the llamas and alpacas and the condors were amazing. Most touching was the puma that was rescued from a nightclub. These animals cannot be returned to the wild and seem to",
          "This is a great place to stop on your way to Pisaq. They take such good care of the animals here. Being from the USA it was great to see animals not native to North America. The Condors were amazing as were the bears and other animals. We learned a lot by having a guide from the",
          "We visited this animal sanctuary by taxi, on the way to Pisaq. It was in our guidebook. It was truly impressive for the Condors. The oldest is 66 years old and the youngest a year or two. They fly over your head from one side of the hill to the other. There are lots of",
          "This animal sanctuary is a great addition to a tour of the Sacred Valley in Peru. This is run by a private family. The animals are rescued and well cared for. The highlight was a close encounter with condors and seeing one of them fly. The pumas were not interested in coming",
          "This was our first time to see the several Lama, Alpaca, Vicuna, a Puma, andean geese, flying condors, guynea pigs...",
          "We booked just the transport to the animal sanctuary and back but weren\u2019t given clear directions of where and who to meet at the main square. When we got there we were taken for a good 10 minute walk and the guide started explaining the history of a church we walked by. Didn\u2019t",
          "Although it is better to see animals in their environment the sanctuary was educational and compassionate. Our guide genuinely loved her job and all the animals.",
          "One may want to know that this is a place to save wildlife more than it is a zoo. They allow visitors to afford the upkeep. Take a moment and donate to their cause. The Condor flying above your head is the one thing I enjoyed the most.",
          "nice place to see alpacas and how they weeve there clothing & die the colors cool zo type atmosphere. expensive gift shop at the end. I wonder if they pay there employees much. if they sell the clothes for $$ marked they can afford to pay them good",
          "Great place to see local animals which were rescued and support this shelter. We had great English guide.",
          "We visited first day and saw these beautiful creatures and also there were handicraft demonstrations which were really interesting!",
          "Never mind a llama photo in Cusco - see them up close! And Alpacas, Vicunias, Condo, Andean geese, and more. This is an animal sanctuary founded by a veterinarian. It used to just survive off donations but now there is a modest entry fee. The tour guides speak good English and",
          "Santuario Animal De Ccochahuasi is a fabulous place where they rehabilitate wild animals who have been captured illegally, and either trafficked or kept as illegal pets when they were babies. Those animals that can be rehabilitated into the wild are, after been nursed back to",
          "Great for a quick stop. For the effort and opportunity it is a \u201cnot to Be missed\u201d. We are Trusting they are truly helping the animals but in a world full of poaching and trafficking any effort to educate and highlight the problems is appreciated. Tour guide was a lot of fun.",
          "This is a small animal sanctuary where animals are rehabilitated and eventually released into the wild, or else cared for there. The guide told us about each animal as we looked at it. He told us where the animal had come from, why it was there, and whether it would eventually",
          "This place is sad, there's really no getting around it. They're underfunded so they're trying their hardest but it's always tough to see animals in places like this. They've been rescued from horrific situations and it's definitely worth going and making a donation so they can",
          "Amazing!!!!!!These are animals that have been abused or in some way unable to be part of the Wild. Some animals are able to go back to the wild. You will see Condors. WOW!!!There is an Eagle, Black Bears, Alpaca, LLama and much more. There is a Guide here who will take",
          "We really loved this place. Really calm and beautiful, and most importantly, all about the welfare of the animals. Really informative guide who told us the stories of the animals. I don't know if this is always included or if we were just lucky but definitely worth asking if",
          "Visited this place yesterday with family and friends. Saw perfectly healthy birds which could be free kept in a small space for tourist to see. Not sure these birds will ever be freed. Sad situation and cagey responses to legitimate questions. More of a zoo than a sanctuary.",
          "A very disappointing visit. This place was advertised as a sanctuary for condors. With the intent to rehabilitate them and release them into the wild. The facilities for the animals were sub optimal and during the presentation we started to ask questions about the release",
          "Our guide was fantastic! We went into every animal habitat. We learned so much and were able to see actual animals that live in South America!",
          "I've always had a heart for animals and so I was very pleased to see just how well the animals were being taken care of here! Really awesome seeing llamas and alpacas up close. Not the biggest zoo but the facilities are clean and well taken care of. Will come back.",
          "The people here really care about the animals. There are such a variety. We especially enjoyed seeing the condors, and their flying across the very large enclosure. The lama's were tame and friendly, and we could feed them. We were happy to buy something at the store to help",
          "We stopped here after visiting Pisac & Maras on way back to Cusco. Charged an admission fee but it gave us an English speaking guide. Got up close with llamas and alpacas and had condors flying around us. Got to see how they dye Valcuna yarn naturally. Gift shop expensive.",
          "Small zoo but with very hommy pisitive energy! Animals have good conditions and looks like guards treat them like family as actually it was 1st time in my life when i saw that animals come when guards call them by names!! Wild cat was playing with my hairs and i did amazing",
          "Our small group had the good fortune to stop here on our way to Machu Picchu. We truly love the effort being made to care for the animals in their sanctuary. They are doing important work and deserve your support.",
          "This is a rescue sanctuary not a zoo. Reached by Cusco city center by bus. Up close with spectacled bears and condors. Worth the trip.",
          "Worth stopping. It is on the way to Pisac from Cusco. It is relatively small but it is clean, the staff are friendly and helpful they treat the refugee animals well and are a good cause. We probably spent 30 to 45 minutes taking a tour.",
          "Feels off the beaten path but was an opportunity to see Peru animals we would not have seen even on the Inka trail: Andean spectacled bear, condors flying, wild cats. It is a bit depressing as it's pretty cage based but clearly the folks are knowledgeable about care for each",
          "Even without kids, my wife and I loved it. We send our children many photos and now they really want to come to Peru. The animals are very friendly. Be careful because they can get a little aggressive when you feed them.",
          "We stopped here on the way to Cusco after staying at the Sacred valley. We asked our driver where we can go to see llamas as we really didn\u2019t see that many at Machu Picchu. The sanctuary was really nice. They really take care of the animals. We saw llamas, alpacas, concords,",
          "Don't miss this incredible refuge for wildlife of Peru. It is so natural and unproduced with all of their attention going toward the animals in need. Would return again!",
          "Although I was a little apprehensive to visit the \"sanctuary\", it was actually a very nice visit. Animals are well cared for and it is impressive to be in the large netted area with the condors sweeping just over your head. Viewing the pumas was an excellent experience as well.",
          "Wonderful little sanctuary. Probably one of my favourite days spent in Peru! The animals all seem very well taken care of and the people who work there are very knowledgeable and clearly know their animals well. The gift shop is also nice and a good place to buy souvenirs to",
          "Lovely small zoo featuring rescued animals representing most of the local Peruvian animals. We especially loved the close encounters. My daughter even got a kiss from the baby Vicuna! They have Spectacled bears who are very playful, two gorgeous puma brothers, and a very large",
          "If so, then this is well worth a visit. One gets to see the animals up close and view their different dense coats. There was an explanation of the natural dyes and the history of the animals in Peru.",
          "Visiting this animal sanctuary was a surprising highlight on our trip. We did not want to take the bus tour to get here (we only wanted to see the animals, not the other site visits), so the office in Cusco was kind enough to arrange a private car to take us straight to the",
          "A non profit organization that takes cares of animals that have being rescued by the governament and locals. It is a small place but very interesting. The entrance fee is 10 soles and is used to help to take care of the animals. Your visit will probably last about 30 minutes.",
          "They nurse these animals back to health and release them into the wild. Really nice people and cool animals native to the area, including Llama and alpaca (of course), Spectacled bears, pumas, condors, and even a few monkeys. took less than 2 total hours from Cusco and back.",
          "The animals and the people give you a great tour. The Llamas were kind and it is funny you have to feed them. Also you can have great pictures",
          "The animals here are well looked after and the aim is to release them back into the wild when they are each ready. The entry price includes a tour guide who was very helpful and knowledgeable. A lovely day trip from Pisac",
          "If you love animals or wildlife, this place will touch your heart. So many beautiful animals with sad stories to tell, but all have a happy ending now at the wildlife sanctuary.",
          "We were 3 couples travelling together on a private tour. This place was part of our itinerary. It is run by a family that cares about animals that were abused. Some of the animals are released back in to the wild.The guide explained about each section. There were Vicunas,",
          "It costs 10 soles the entry. You can arrive to this place by bus from Cusco to Pisac or viceversa (2 or 3 soles each way). Just ask the driver to let you get off at the zoo. It is not a zoo actually. We had a guide who was not very well trained. However we could heard other",
          "Out of two and a half weeks in Peru, this was the worst day of the whole holiday. We explained to the main office we simply would like to visit the sanctuary. They seemed to understand and We paid 70 soles for the trip. We waited at the meeting point where we were meant to at",
          "Most visitors don't visit this Sacred Valley wildlife sanctuary and they are missing out. It is a family-run charitable organization rehabilitating injured and sick wildlife. A visit not only brings you up close and personal with the animals (condors, puma, coati, llamas,",
          "Good: nice opportunity to see some of the local wildlife without going to the jungle (which we didn\u2019t have time for this trip). They do a condor breeding program too, which is great for the endangered species. They provide a guide, who gave us a lot of info on the animals. There",
          "The Santuario allows the tourists to feed the animals and it is the closest you will get from a Llama, Alpaca or Vicu\u00f1a (unless you pay 5 soles for locals, to take one with their own animals). Worth the visit!",
          "I REALLY wanted to check this place out, but was unable to do so based on scheduling limitations. :( My fault for trying to book day of.. The lady in the Cusco office was very helpful. I recommend knowing the hours of the bus/tours before the day you want to visit..",
          "A very good way to come close to regional animals. The Lamas/ Alpacas are very friendly and will let you pet them for the time of a picture. Our guide rushed the visit to a point that is almost a lack of respect but we asked to stay longer and could then enjoy the place.",
          "OK, it's a touch on the zoo side, but it's pretty difficult to get a good look at condor in Peru & this just fits the bill. Sure, pet the alpaca and sheep, look at the other guys they've rescued, but sit & wait for the condor to fly from the hill in front of you, down the",
          "I went with my teens and we all loved it. Got a private tour of the small space by a member of this family-owned animal sanctuary that rescues and protects endangered and rescued species. We saw crazy monkeys, a bear(!), pumas, a condor, and more. We were invited into the llama",
          "We had a great experience here. Learned about local animals, got to support their rescue and we were able to see and connect with animals never seen in the U.S. The condors were my favorite! There give tours to kids/school groups and teach as well. Really wonderful place.",
          "When you arrive at the sanctuary you are given a tour and the guides are very knowledgeable and really enjoy their jobs. The best animals are the Condors, Pumas, Bears and Macaws. Watching the condors fly from one side to the other is the highlight. The sanctuary is very",
          "An amazing place to see these beautiful animals up close. The work they do there is wonderful and so great to see. It is so worth the tiny bit of money they ask for a donation. We did it as part of a tour and it was still extremely inexpensive.",
          "Stopped by this animal sanctuary on our recent travels. Very similar to a small zoo but as they say the animals were all rescued from one place or another. Saw some unusual animals such as spectacle bear and condors. You could pet the lamas and vicunas and get very close to the",
          "First of all.. you do NOT have to pay 35 soles for the organised tour. Take a Collectivo towards Pisac (from Cusco, or vice versa) its 3 soles each way, ask the driver to stop at the sanctuary and he will drop you right outside the door, its on the route. I paid 10 soles entry",
          "My family and I were lost, looking for a hostel in Cusco in May 2017. A lady came up to us, and asked if we needed help. We usually don't accept help from strangers but everywhere we looked was too expensive for the accommodations my mom was looking for. This lady helped us",
          "You can go inside and be very close to, even touch, majority of animals that are not dangerous, like llamas, alpacas, parrots. Condors are flying just above you. Other like panthers, you can observe from safe distance. Strong point of the sanctuary seems to be the staff, who",
          "The people who run the sanctuary are so knowledgeable and dedicated to what they do for these animals. We were shown around and each animals background and future explained in extremely good English. A must if you are travelling to Pisac. Will take around 45 mins to see and very",
          "It was great seeing some of the typical animals from Peru that are hard to see in the wild: condors, coatis, vicunas, guanacos, parrots, different kinds of monkeys... It was also very interesting to see how Andean women color the alpaca wool with different natural pigments and",
          "Part of me wants to believe these animals really are better off having been rescued, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from their surroundings - no space to run, swing, fly, no privacy for them. it was at first amazing to see what animals you were seeing, and then just",
          "Where else can you be in a huge caged area with amazing Andean Condors? The largest land based birds is the world. Wow! What a great experience. 11 foot wing span. Pet lamas & Alpacas, pick up tortoises, see mountain lion. All reduced animals. Good to support their",
          "This is a lovely spot kind of in the middle of nowhere - or on the way to/from different spots and I definitely recommend stopping. It is not expensive and a neat way to visit some cool local animals. It's great that it's a sanctuary so they take good care of the animals and",
          "This is a interesting place to see the local animals - llamas, condors, and their little bears. It was nice to see and support and organization that is providing some animal rehabilitation in this country. The tour itself was rather short - about 30-40 minutes. A great little",
          "This is a most stop to learn all about the Llamas. They have many different kinds and you can feed them and touch them. The place is like a mall farm and you can do it in a hour or two. They have the local artisans there doing the local crafts.",
          "Great place to see the local animals. The animals are huge and we were able to feed them. Some of the animals were so funny, it seemed like they liked posing for pictures. The animals also seemed happy. Good short stop.",
          "Really great work and a unique opportunity to visit up close as the animals are being rehabilitated. Very close to cusco. A photographers dream, great with families with kids",
          "We stopped there on our way back from Pisac, and we are glad we did! It is a nice sanctuary where they take good care of their animals. The little information center is also interesting. We had quite a lot of fun feeding the alpacas and llamas and taking pictures with them! I",
          "This proved to be a highlight for my kids in the Sacred Valley. We had an opportunity to see and understand several unique animals - spectacle bears, guanaco, puma, and condors. In the case of the condors, we all very much enjoyed being able to be right in the aviary with",
          "We were terrified this would be a sad roadside zoo but it's a legitimate rescue operation with dedicated staff. It is small but they are helping out Andean wildcats, condors and assorted other animals. Their craft store is terrific.",
          "This place is so cute! About 30 min with bus/car from Cusco, outside of Pisac. This little animal sanctuary really takes care of their animals. Making sure they're in good health as well. The staff speaks both English and Spanish. They have all kinds of animals and it sure was a",
          "This is a place where they rehab animals they've found being smuggled into/out of the country. Nice stop on our way to Pisaq. See condors, bears, wild cats, llamas, monkeys..oh my!",
          "A short and cheap bus ride out of Cusco allowed us to see condors where everyone we spoke to that had gone to Colco Canyon specifically to see them did not see any.",
          "Intimate experiences with the local animals. We fed Llamas and saw a couple of spectacle bears. The condors were amazing, soaring above our heads, so close we could feel the down draft. Little monkeys too. The kids loved it.",
          "A family run endeavor doing their best with limited resources. Please support their efforts. Our English speaking tour guide made sure we were well informed and entertained",
          "This was a great 2 1/2 hour excursion to finish our Cusco/Machu Picchu trip. We booked a private car with Jimmy scheduled with Condoropentours to just the animal rescue center. Our guide, Albert, was excellent! It is small, but you get up close with condors, tortoises,",
          "I enjoyed first hand interaction with the different types of cameloids. The animals are so used to humans that they feed right out of our hands. The sanctuary is very well kept by the care takers. The explanation of the different types of animals was very educative.",
          "Great stop in Cusco. Awesome to see the animals and guides are very knowledgeable. They rescue animals and take very good care of them.",

          "It's difficult to see animals not in the wild but I believe they are doing a great job in taking care of these abandoned animals and it's worth learning about the native species. To see condors so close was something we probably cannot do anywhere else. Worth the trip just",
          "We had a great time at the reserve and enjoyed having a guide walk along with us and answer any questions. To future visitors I would say have an open mind and be flexible with transport. We took an uber from Cuzco for about 20 soles, and flagged down a local shared van for a",

          "Loved the sanctuary!! Super cool to get to take a \"llama selfie\" and see bears, parrots, condors, and many other Peruvian animals. Tours in English and Spanish!",
          "We stopped here on our private tour with Cusco Transport. It is a sanctuary for injured/abused Peruvian animals. The highlight was the condors. They are huge, and impressive when flying. Not a long or expensive stop (10 soles/pp) but worth it.",
          "The sanctuary is about 30 minutes from the centre by car; the animals vary, of course, but you are probably sure to find llamas/vacunas, bald Peruvian dogs, condors, bears etc. It's not one of those sanctuaries where you get to interact much with the animals but you get up close",
          "This animal sanctuary was such a fun spot to visit. We learned the different animals in the llama/alpaca family as well as watching condors practice flying prior to their release. Ahppy to support this place!",
          "Wonderful stop on our Peruvian tour. This is a charity that allows travelers to see their rehabbing animals surely with the expectation of a needed donation. To most of us North Americans these are animals we never see. Would be a great stop for anyone with children",
          "Wonderful alpacas and llamas, condors, birds and monkeys -- ladies working on handicrafts and a fine Sol shop -- and it's a charity!",
          "Very interesting and a closeup view of the llamas. You can even feed them if you like but be careful...some of them spit! After seeing the animals you will have a chance to see how they weave the beautiful material for their clothes, hats and shawls. You will also have the",
          "This review will be in two parts part 1- The Sanctuary itself. Good experience. Worth your 30 minutes to see the critically endangered andean condor and the peruvian hairless dog. It is a private sanctuary, not a zoo, dedicated to helping endangered animals and is worth your",
          "Our guide from Cusco Local Friend, Hugo, asked if we wanted to make a quick stop here. We thought it would be interesting, as this is really not so much as a zoo, but a sanctuary for some of the rescued animals. It is a great chance to see alpaca, llama, vicuna up close and",
          "We learned a lot about the animals that were recued by this zoo. We got to pet the llamas and alpacas and learned about the different camelids in the area. Highly reccomend it!",
          "Well worth the stop. Learn about llama and alpaca - feed them. Watch the local women weave, and of course buy some wonderful alpaca items in the shop - all are marked with the type of fiber, and woman who made it and her village - the proceeds go back to them directly.",
          "Great way to see the andean animals, wild andean cat, condors, alpacas, bears, parrots. Opportunity to have pictures with some animals",
          "I'm not big on capturing and keeping animals so a bit conflicted about these types of places. I did learn about various local animal habits and traits but it seemed to me that most were confined to pretty tiny spaces, kind of like being in jail. Not sure how happy the animals",
          "Animals of all types are here in the sanctuary for protection. Most having been injured and nursed back to health and unfortunately can not be let into the wild again. Lots to see. Fun!",
          "Come here if you have a chance, supporting this place is a great way to not only help Peru's wildlife, but also to meet and appreciate it. We were given an opportunity to meet Llamas and the other three types of camelids that call Peru home. And the ability to get up close to",
          "It was very cool to see some of the local animals (sun bears, cougars, foxes, condors, alpacas, hairless dogs, parrots, etc). Considering they receive no money at all from the Peruvian government, they do a nice job. Try and split up your shopping between this place and",

          "Long drive about 40 minutes to get to the sanctuary. When we got there we had booked a group tour but ended up receiving a private tour so that was good. Was shown the animals and got to know bit about why they were in rehab.. It was great to see 9 condors from up close - and",
          "This is the first place we got to meet Vicu\u00f1a and got to feel their amazing soft coat. The team here does a excellent job in rescuing and rehabilitating the rare/amazing animals from the worst of circumstances and provide them with a caring environment.",
          "See mountain lions, honey ears, tortoises and so much more....best part is to be able to be inside the condor cage. Worth every minute!",
          "Interesting place for raising these animals and making good alpaca scarfs and other clothings. We bought several scarfs for ourselves and family.",
          "This is a small animal sanctuary but the animals seem to be very well cared for and happy. Our guide walked us through the steps from where each animal was rescued from to rehabilitating the animals and to how many get released back into the wild. Everyone was very knowledgeable",
          "By American standards, this would probably qualify as a \"roadside\" type zoo. However, I do have to really give great credit to the people who are involved here. They are working on a very limited budget to try to save some endangered species as well as rehab some animals.",
          "There are lots of animals being looked after in this sanctuary. The guides are happy to show off all their animals. Pumas and condors are the stars.",
          "Condors fly over your head and you can watch a baby spectacled bear play and be silly. Watch out for Pete the vicunia, he is a little grouchy, but his pen mate the tortoise makes up for it. We enjoyed time here on the double decker tour bus. So much fun!",
          "Some of the poor reviews here express doubts about whether this place is genuinely an \"animal sanctuary\" or more of a for-profit petting zoo, but if you don't have misgivings about the morality of caged animals (or if you believe that they were injured and rehabilitated at this",
          "We were so excited to learn that we could go to an animal sanctuary in Cusco. It was an awesome and informative place. We were able to pet Llama's, see birds and bears and the coolest thing was definitely the condors! Simply amazing!",
          "The animal sanctuary is a great stop between Cusco and Pisaq. You are able to be in very close proximity to a wide variety of native animals. Of course there are a number of llamas, alpacas, and vicunas. However the highlights were the pumas and condors. How many opportunities",
          "Take your family to this sanctuary. You will have an amazing time and learn a lot about those Andino animals.",
          "We visited it during a tour of the sacred valley. If you have no other chance to see some of the characteristic representatives of the local fauna, then give it a chance! We saw some llamas, alpacas, vicunias, a couple of condors, an eagle, a wild cat, parrots...In the end of",

          "I understand people need income, but when you have to push a condor various times a day so it can fly as a spectacle for a bus full of tourists, it shouldn't be considered an animal sanctuary. It was basically a guys farm with caged in animals.",
          "I thought the idea was great, as we were told by a very good English speaking guide that most of the animals in the sanctuary were rescued. It was very good to see the condors, and seeing pumas were unbelievable. However, I personally think the cages were too small, especially",
          "Good guide in English. Good explanations. The animals are in good hands, cages could be bigger though.",
          "We were given an English speaking guide when we entered (There is no fee but they do except donations). Our guide explained the purpose of this non-profit animal sanctuary and there goal to release as many animals as possible. They have several Condors and will begin to",

          "We stopped here on our way back from Pisac and felt it worthwhile. It is small and only takes about a half hour to see. It is free but you should leave a donation for a worthy cause. The condors are impressive to see. What a wingspan!!! And the volunteers are doing a good thing",

          "I think what this place does with condors is really good, breeding them and releasing the ones they can. I loved having the chance to see them up close. I didn't ask why the older ones were there as I had already asked a lot of questions about what was going on with the other",

          "Able to get up pretty close to the animals. Doing great work to preserve their existence and rehab back to natural habitat. Would need car or go on day tour.",
          "What an amazing place! Not the level of the San Diego zoo or sea world but they do well on a limited budget. Where else in the world can you pet a condor? I am sure this will change in the near future so see it NOW!",
          "I really wanted an opportunity to see animals originally from he rain forest and have the opportunity to touch some of them. While I didn't touch many animals, the experience was still awesome. Watching the Condors fly with their massive wing span was something I'll never",
          "It is a small animal sanctuary only a short drive from Cusco. The work they do is amazing! All the animals are super cute and the guide is very informative of each animal and why they are there. The squirrel monkeys definitely stole my heart! \u2764\ufe0f Worth the trip for sure!",

          "Absolutely loved it here! Intimate place, yet with loads of animals, alot of which i have never seen before in real life. Our guide gave us a very detailled tour and explained everything in spanish (my gf had to translate the parts which i couldnt understand, it was funny :D )",
          "This amazing place is free to the public, but you should definitely donate when you leave! It's a rather large enclosure where they keep all sorts of rescue animals (condors, llamas, vicu\u00f1as, dogs, mountain lions, turtles, parrots...) and you can go right up to most of them. The",

          "It was really nice to see those animals (puma, condor, llamas, araras). I do not like to see animals locked but they say it is not a zoo. They take care of them untill they are good to go back to nature life. Aurelio was a good guide at the local!",
          "It's good to know this place exists. For a very small entrance fee you can see some animals up close. The condors were magnificent even though they are not that pretty. Well worth the stop. They have a small gift shop. If you purchase an item part of the proceeds go for the care",
          "A three trip which is great fun and easy on the lungs while your not accustomed to the altitude. Llamas, alpacas, condors, Pumas, wildcats and vicu\u00f1a small very cute etc. but the tour was made by the excellent tour guide Jimmy. You can see how much the guides love all of the",

          "My friend and I visited this wildlife sanctuary in August 2012. We really enjoyed seeing the native animals. We were able to go into the enclosure with the Andean condors and have them fly over us. It was incredible to feel the wind from their enormous wings. They are huge.",
          "If you have an extra hour and are around the area go to this place. The animals you will see here were rescued. You can be very close to the stately Condor",
          "Jimmy showed us around and it was fantastic. The people of this sanctuary are real heroes! Seeing an Andean condor up so close was a real memory for life. They have plenty of other animals too (including wild cats and pumas). Just wished I left a bigger voluntary contribution at",

          "Yes I was grumpy and running low on sleep, but we took the bus form the Cuzco square and it took 2 hours to get to the park because we had a quickie drive through tour of everything in Cuzco. Same on the way back. We only were given about 30 minutes at the sanctuary and at",
          "So I just went today with my wife, after reading a ton of reviews this was a must. After finally figuring out through their website that is improperly listed here (google it) you can buy your ticket and get transport to their location for S/ 30. Great deal right? Well",
          "We got to see a Condor, which was magnificent! Wingspan of about 18 feet and they had then flying, then standing beside us. Great idea to help the animals but not too much else to see. It was on the tour but could have missed it.",
          "We were so fortunate to make the trip to this valuable sanctuary. Volunteer guide Aurelio was so passionate about the work they do here in saving such beautiful animals. The Macaws were gorgeous, as w ere the llamas. Having the Majestic condors flying so close to us and having",
          "We visited Ccochahausi and it was such a wonderful experience! They are doing so much amazing work with these endangered and once abused animals. The sanctuary is large, clean, and the enclosures are well designed. It was about a 30min drive from Cusco. A van picks you up",

          "One of the nice things about living in the Cusco region is that I have the opportunity to visit places like the Cochahuasi Animal Sanctuary on a fairly regular basis and have had the pleasure to see it growing. When I first visited over 3 years ago they had, among other things,",
          "A very pleasant surprise during our stay in Cusco! After finding this sanctuary on tripadvisor, we got a taxi which took about 40 minutes to get there and absolutely loved it! The staff are doing excellent work at this sanctuary and they had fantastic and interesting animals to",

          "This is an amazing non profit sanctuary that helps rehabilitate injured and animals in need of help. Once they have recuperated they are released back to the wild.",
          "This is not a big fancy place but it's worth it to see the condors fly right by you and get some great pictures with them and other animals. There is also a chance to purchase some handmade alpaca goods (and other things), they seemed to be better quality for the prices",

          "This a non-governmental charity that takes care of injured animals. It is about 20 minutes from Pisac. We were given a tour by the staff and saw alpacas, llamas, vicunas, parrots, pumas, eagles, even condors -- my son was able to feed a couple of them. We even got into an",

          "On the way to PISAC stopped to see this animal sanctuary where I got to see for the first time one ALPACA and the other cousins of the CAMEL. This is a must to get to know the Peruvian pack horse.",
          "Awesome value ,although it takes 3/4hour from Cuzco to get there, and the same back but its a great option and you are supporting a brilliant conservation cause... and they really really need the money , and it shows. So buy something from the shop or give a donation.",
          "Great to see condors fly. They do what they can with very limited funds and they need more visitors. They run a bus from the centre of Cusco which is included in the fee.",

          "Wonderful educational tour of this wildlife rehabilitation shelter, where you can see up close the Andean Condor, Pumas, bobcat, llama, alpaca, vicuna, etc. Staffed by a bioethicist and wildlife biologists with whom you can talk about issues in the care of these animals. No",

          "I went to their office and bought a ticket for the 130pm tour and I was the only one who went! I'm surprised they took just me. Anyway, the whole thing took about 2 hours. I was hoping to see more animals, but it was OK. The tour guide's English wasn't as good as my Spanish",
          "The group they took was not too big, so it didn't feel rushed or too touristy. Apparently there's only one agency that sells the tickets, which is across the road from Plaza de Armas. I loved the way they actually have a genuine interest in the animals they have. The guide we",

          "Our group stopped here and we were so surprised to be able to see all of the Peruvian animals up close....the puma and condors especially! The vicunyas were amazing too- they tried to jump through the fence and attack us- wild and untamed creatures! Beautiful birds, llamas",

          "This is worth a quick stop to see the work they are doing with the animals and also to see the amazing condors. This stop took half an hour at most. A guide will show you around and tell you about the animals and will get the condor to fly.",
          "this was a wonderful opportunity to see indigenous peruvian animals that I would not otherwise have been able to see. It's really very inspiring, rather than sad. The sanctuary attempts to rehabilitate the animals and send them back into the wild if possible. If not, it",
          "We visited this sanctuary in March, but I was a little disappointed. We arrived and was assigned an English speaking guide who was very enthusiastic but seemed to rush us around very quickly. I thought that I would have enough time to take pictures afterwards but this was not",
          "I wasn't enthusiastic about the idea of seeing caged condors but I was won over. It's so clear that the heart of this establishment is in the right place and it is heart breaking to realise so many of these animals have been rescued from far worse cages. It was incredible to see",
          "I was so happy to see what this rescue zoo is doing for so many unfortunate animals. Very informative and such amazing animals and local crafts to see. A must!!",

          "Had made arrangements for the 9am tour and made our payment online. Showed up to the meeting point 20 minutes early. When it was 10 minutes past the pick up time, I called and was told it would be another 15. An hour later, a guy shows up in an unmarked van and told me to come",
          "This place was recommended by our taxi driver. It is a sanctuary that rescues animals that are mistreated or abused and cannot return to the wild. Among the collection of many alpacas, llamas, pumas, tortoises, there are 3 massive condors. The cage is huge. Large enough to",
          "Our guide for the day suggested a stop here and we were not disappointed. Seeing the rescued animals and hearing their stories was educational. Never guessed we would see condors. Shame on the humans who harmed the animals and kudos to those who operate the sanctuary. A treasure.",
          "Great animal sanctuary. I saw the following animals (note this list is not exhaustive): - tortoises - alpacas - condors - falcons - pumas - monkeys It's a family run organization and your visit helps. My heart was broken at the sight of one eyed falcons, pumas whose",

          "Really nice place near Cusco. A must see. Friendly staff and friendly animals. Take a taxi to get there kind of cheaper than the tour from Cusco.",
          "As some have said before, there doesn't appear to be a great deal here, but what they have in the collection, and what they have achieved is terrific. Just to be able to sit close-up to a pair of Condors, on the ground and skimming overhead, was worth the trip alone, but then",
          "We took an 11 am trip to the sanctuary. It was easy and safe to book in the office at plaza de Armas. We left on-time on a small bus (bigger than minibus), see official website. It was about 40 min drive. When we arrived we were split into two groups (Spanish and English",

          "It is a rescue sanctuary for animals. Definitely worth to visit. You will see the typical animals from this region being nursed back to health. To me what was truly amazing was the experience of being so close to the Andean condor. No where can you see them up close. Kudos to",

          "We visited the sanctuary on a bus from the main square in Cusco. We had read about it and wanted to go, but just came across the bus by chance. We had a private tour, as we were the only English speakers on our bus. It was really interesting hearing how the animals had been",

          "This place is incredible. We visited on a tour with our taxi driver on the way to pisac, it would be difficult to find alone! Our guide Maurice was very helpful and was able to tell us stories about each individual animal they had rescued and what exactly they are trying to do",
          "This is a very interesting stop on the way to the Sacred Valley. It was encouraging to see the native animals taken well of. A small donation ( maybe 10 sol) is greatly appreciated by the staff. We were given a condor topped pen,",
          "a real hidden treasure, many locals didn't even know about it, I emailed them directly and they picked us up at the main plaza next day and took us to a very special sanctuary, it was not a zoo but a more unique place, we were able to be inside the condor cage and have a condor",
          "Cool animals, you get right next to them. There were macaws just walking around everywhere, Condors that fly right next to you, and a puma in a cage. Very nice, like a petting zoo with better animals. They are still trying to get better organized, and they sell things like",
          "This was a great place we stopped by based on TA reviews- it was such a fun experience! Beautiful animals and a great cause-I was swept up in the moment and bought a baby alpaca table runner for $300 and my tour guide laughed at me later, saying I had been swindled. I'll chalk",
          "The sanctuary does amazing work in bringing back to health wild animals and releasing them back, when possible, into the wild. There is no entrance fee, but the guide gave us such an impressive tour of the place that we really wanted to give a large donation. You can see condors",
          "Our tour guide brought us to this zoo on our way to the Sacred Valley. It was very cool to see all of the native animals up close. They even have a condor enclosure you can enter and see these birds fly. There is no entrance fee but expect to feel obligated to spend money in",
          "During our visit to the Sacred Valley on June 21, our guide asked us if we would like to stop at this refuge, that we had not heard about. It is not a zoo but a care-center for animals that have been illegally captured (some for illegal trafficking) or injured. The staff are",
          "I am not into zoos, and I don't like seeing animals in cages. However, each animal here has a much better home than where they came from. The guide will walk you through and tell you why they acquired each animal. For example, 2 pumas were rescued from a nightclub in Lima.",
          "This animal sanctuary is a bit hard to get to but well worth it. We first went to see the ruins surrounding Cusco and hired a taxi from there (Qunqo). It is a 30 minute taxi ride. We paid 90 soles (about $27) round trip plus the driver waited one hour for us while we were at the",
          "Good opportunity to observe wild animals at close. I could even touch a condor. It was a unique experience after seeing these huge birds in Colca valley in their original habitat. Please keep in mind that it is not a zoo but a rescue center for injured animals. The tour is free",
          "We toured the facility which rehabilitates injured or neglected animals. The area is set up to accommodate each type of animal including the mighty condor. A demonstration of weaving gives an appreciation for the work involved. The gift shop at the end of the tour helps to fund",
          "Excellent tour of the animal sanctuary! We especially liked seeing the Andean Condors in flight and the Pumas!",
          "This is an actual condor rescue facility, and was told it's the only place to see one. We saw pumas (sacred to Peruvians), and they have llamas and vicuna too, although those last two are seen lots of places. Quick tour by a biologist includes having him call to the condors",
          "One of the highlights of our Peru trips. Amazing place, great mission, wonderful people. Take a break from touristy Cusco and spend a couple of hours in a magical place.",
          "We were really impressed with this place - great educational message, outstanding facilities for the wildlife and a nice selection of items to purchase to support their cause. We got most of our souvenirs here!",
          "If you love animals, this is for you. They have the cutest little collection of llamas, alpacas and a couple of spitting vicunas! Huge condors, and the star of the show was the owner's Peruvian Hairless dog! He's so ugly he's cute. It was also fun to see how the weaver's use",
          "My family and I stopped here with our tour guide on our way to the Pisaq market. This was one of the highlights of our trip. You got to see many Peruvian animals that have been rescued. We saw llamas, alpacas, pumas, condors, macaws, etc. It was great!!! The people that",
          "A neat little place where they care for abandoned former pets. An interesting hodgepodge of species. The highlight is the condor flight.There is not charge, but you should expect to buy some souvenirs at the end of your visit. The souvenir prices were reasonable.",
          "We stopped by this sanctuary as part of a day tour of the Sacred Valley, and we definitely enjoyed getting close to some of the unique animals of Peru including 2 of the animals sacred to the Inca (the Puma and the Condor). It is a small place but everyone is enthusiastic; I",
          "Great job these people are doing, the sanctuary was free of charge to visit, a donation is gratefully accepted on exit... and a free gift given as a thank you. We saw the condors up close and personal, llamas, macaws, pumas, guinea pigs and heaps more. Be supportive and visit",
          "This was included in one of our tours and we thoroughly enjoyed this visit, where they rehab injured animals. We were lucky to see the condors up close - they are huge, pumas, macaws, alpacas, llamas, all sorts of interesting animals. We gave a donation at the end of our visit",
          "This animal sanctuary is a really neat place to see some rare rescued animals up close and personal. You can take lots of pictures and even interact with some of the animals. The tour guides speak English and explain all of the animals and where they were rescued from. We saw",
          "Great work by volunteers and donations to rehabilitate rescued animals from local areas and the Amazon and prepare them for release back into their habitat. Terrific opportunity to see some rare species and get close to many. No entry fee, but after your tour, if you're not",
          "I enjoyed the tour and seeing the animals (especially Condors, Pumas & Macaws). The sanctuary is small but they seem to be doing good work and it\u00b4s an interesting thing to do for a morning or afternoon in Cusco away from the main tourist haunts. Lots of people don\u00b4t seem to know",
          "if you have 2 hrs to spare, take this trip! for 25 soles well spent, a shuttle from Plaza de Armas will take you to and from the animal sanctuary. Once there, you will get a 45 min guided tour of the intimate sanctuary. The stories about each of the animals there is wonderful,",
          "I absolutely loved this place. I was impressed with the volunteer guide and his presentation about each animal. The surroundings in which the animsls are kept are clean, accommodating of their individual needs. The condor show is spectacular. The shop overcharged me for some",
          "On the way from Cuzco to Urubamba if you go Via Pizac (Longer but with great things to see.) A small group of very dedicated animal lovers have Condors, Pumas and other rescued animal you can see. You can even go in the Condor Pen and they fly over you. Great stop over and buy",
          "First, I would like to say that this is a very small sanctuary. I expected a slightly larger area with more animals. However, other that that, my experience at the animal sanctuary was very good. My tour guide spoke good English. He also seemed to be very knowledgeable,",
          "Enjoyed my visit, caring staff but 3 pumas and 4 condors, not sure there is much conservation. Funded by donation. Good exhibition of wool dyes. They force 3 condors to fly for food. Having seen condors in the wild later in our holiday felt sorry for the 4 here",
          "I had wanted to check out this place since reading about it on Tripadvisor...but wasn't sure how to reach it on my own (not many locals knew about this either!). It turns out that they send out shuttle buses to the Plaza de armas in Cusco twice daily (not sure what time they",
          "this is an incredible place to visit for those loving animals, I would say that when you come out after the visit, you feel yourself relieved thinking that people take care of the animals, struggling against the illegal hunting and commerce, ah! and you can take great pics.",
          "My brother and I hired a taxi for the day to see the Sacred Valley. We stopped here and it was worth the whole day's trip. I have seen a condor refuge outside of Otavalo, Ecuador, but they did not fly over my head. Enjoy the picture.",
          "This very special sanctuary for endangered and injured animals relies on donations from the public. See condors in flight and learn about the local animals.",
          "It wasn't the most amazing thing I did in Peru, but you get to see a condor fly, and the people are very friendly. They speak English too, so you can have a tour in English if you want.",
          "What a superb find! Truly delightful! On the road to Pizac is this little animal sanctuary where they have accepted injured or abused animals. The staff are quite charming and you will see more Peruvian animals in five minutes than you will during the rest of your holiday. This",
          "Last year another family told us that their kids loved this place above all else during their trip to Cuzco. It held true. This was probably my kids' favorite place to visit while we were in the Cuzco area. Seeing the condors was the highlight, and also a territorial Vicuna",
          "We loved our visit here. The pumas didn't come out of their \"cave\" but the condors were really amazing to see and very friendly!",
          "First off I'm shocked by a few of the comments. One guy states he thinks the animals would be better served in the wild. These animals are in a sancuary because they can not function in the wild. You will see some of the animals are injured. You will have a condor fly",
          "I saw a lot of animals, like condor, puma, birds of different colors, etc. The staff was very friendly and gave us the tour of the place. This place took care of animals that were abused. They sell some scarves, sweaters, etc. and the earnings go to protecting these animals.",
          "A 20 min trip from Cusco. Get to see a Condor, Llamas, Vicunia and Alpacas. Free, but you can donate any amount, it goes to saving these animals.",
          "A magnificent opportunity to see rare Peruvian native species and help a wonderful cause. Ask to see it as most tours skip this gem.",
          "Our family loved every moment of this sanctuary, up close and friendly with massive condors, hand feeding rare parrots, whilst seeing puma's recovering from human interaction. The guides are great and kids will just love it as you enter the condor cage and see and feel them fly",
          "Great things come in small sizes! This place is great... lots of animals, all rescues, way better than forking your money over to a Zoo. Staff was very friendly, and the Condors flying over your head is something which words will not do justice.... definitely recommend this",
          "During our day trip in the Sacred valley, our taxi driver recommended stopping here and it was worth it. It's a great initiative to protect and rehabilate animals that were in captivity/poor conditions and are not fit to reenter the wild. The lady who showed us the different",
          "We visted here today and really enjoyed ourselves. It's obvious how much they care for the animals and are passionate about showing the public around. I'm not a fan of zoos at all and was a little apprehensive before visiting as I hate seeing animals behind bars but the",
          "We stopped on our tour of the Sacred Valley. It was worth it to see so many animals up close. We also enjoyed the weaving and shopping at the store.",
          "Sharon and I dropped in here on our way to Pisaq Markets in the Sacred Valley about 20 minutes out of Cusco. We were warmly welcomed and escorted (probably a little bit quickly) through the complex by a English speaking attendant which helped immensely with our understanding of",
          "For 20 soles a person they will drive you out to visit this rescue center with condors, parrots, vicu\u00f1a, even a tortoise. They are providing a home and rehab for injured or endangered animals and will ask for a small donation. They also have many lovely things in their gift",
          "Animals looked well cared for except the macaws, they need to be moved into a heated area. Trying to do good work but should work closer with governmental agency like Inrena to meet government standards. Not worth the taxi ride out to see this attraction. It's a rehabilitation",
          "We stopped by as part of an animal volunteer project. This sanctuary was a great stop on our tour. Really interesting - nice to see animals \"living happily\" together.",
          "I had been trying to get good pics of the Condors and Acunas earlier in the trip but couldn't, as they were in nature. But here in the sanctuary it was nice to see them up close and also being cared for by loving and attentive staff. It's a great thing to support and I",
          "We stopped by this animal rescue on our way to the Sacred Valley of Pisac and absolutely loved it. We learned a great deal about the animals in the Andes region and were able to pet & feed different varieties of Llamas & Alpacas and even see condor feed while we were in their",
          "This is one of our favourite places we have been on our trip so far. We pulled in as we travelled from Cusco to Pisac. Most of the animals are rescued and you don't pay to get it but give a donation or buy something from their shop. I love places like this where they are",
          "This is an excellent opportunity to see some of the south american wildlife. Thank goodness someone sis doing this. The birds are gorgeous and there is some wild cats that are a beautiful also.",
          "This place is great, we take our guests here often and they allwayse love it. The people at Cochahuasi are providing abused and misstreated animals with a safe and caring enviroment and do their best to rehabilitat and release back to the wild any animals they can. The highlight",
          "This was my second visit to Cochahuasi and I was very impressed with the improvements since my last visit 2 years ago. More animals and better enclosures, especially for the pumas. They have added a fiber and weaving demo and the gift shop is now truly impressive. They seem to",
          "I am a veterinarian and my husband found this place online prior to our trip. Needless to say, I had to visit, and I was not disappointed. The sanctuary is full of beautiful and well taken care of animals that each have an interesting and often sad story about how they ended up",
          "The sanctuary are doing great things for the animals and it is worth taking time out to stop to visit whether you are heading to Pisac or Cusco. The kids loved it as did the grown-ups. A nice variety of animals to view. Payment is by donation and the guides tell you in full",
          "Our tour guide stopped with us here last minute. We loved the chance to view so many animals up close. (This is a rescue animal place if you weren't aware.) We saw condors, macaws, pumas, a stork, vicu\u00f1a, llama, alpacas, turtles, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something! A young",
          "It's a wonderful little place to visit. Not really signposted and a bit out of the way so a taxi is probably the best way to get there unless you are on a tour that stops there. Entry is free, donations and/or buying from the gift shop is encouraged. Volunteer show you around",
          "I would have missed this as a tour because the tour was being sold on the Street. I was amazed to find out and in fact did stand right next to two condors with their wings spread open. The place is safe and a very nice drive over the mountains overlooking Cusco. The dive took",
          "I read about this on WikiTravel which I will always consult from now on as well as Lonely Planet which did not include. This fine family does not charge you to observe at close range pumas, tortoises, vicunas, jungle cats and the mighty Andean condors. Clean surroundings and",
          "Our private guide recommended this locale and it was amazing, educational and would highly recommend a stop. The Cochahuasi guide provided a very compelling explanation of the history of the animals and how they came to live at this sanctuary. You get a very close up, hands on",
          "This was a lot of fun and a great short stop on our way back from Pisac to Cusco. We stopped for about 45 minutes. Our guide spoke very good English ANC showed and explained how they got many animals, including vicunas, pumas, and condors. Seeing the hugs condors fly by was",
          "This is an interesting place to visit that not only affords you the opportunity to see a variety of Peruvian animals, but is also doing some good in the process. Aside from rescuing a variety of animals, the center is also hoping to start a Condor breeding program to help",
          "During my all day Sacred Valley tour, the Ccochahuasi sanctuary was my first stop. By Northern American standards, it's small and some animals are in rather tight caging. However the people running the sanctuary and making the effort to save animals native to their country. My",
          "We visited CCOCHAHUASI on our way from Pisac to Cusco. First the llama-Alpaca Ranch where we hand fed and mingled with them. Now we know the difference between llama, Alpaca, Vincuna and guanacos. Then across the road to the sanctuary. Puma, Condors, parrots, and many more.",
          "A small place, but worth it. About 30 minutes outside of Cusco, on the way to Pisac. The highlight is the 3 Peruvian Condors which are huge! They let you get right next to them, and they will fly off which is kind of nerve racking considering how large they are. They even make a",
          "We found a volunteer handing out flyers in plaza de armas. We had a taxi take us there and back for 20 soles (\u00a35) for 40 mins journey each way. The place itself is very run down , no sign on outside u would drive past not knowing it was there. We had a volunteer show us round",
          "This is sort of an animal rescue/zoo/educational venue that is a must see. We also didn't have this on our itinerary and it was empty, so I suspect that it doesn't get visited by most tour programs, but our local guide thought that our kids would like it and it was one of the",
          "This is a great place, run by animal lovers, the animals come from neglect, or are seized animals, some are rehabilitated to the wild some will stay forever due to the abuse they suffered, it is well worth your time to see.",
          "This place was one of the highlights of my visit to Peru, but it was not on our group itinerary. We heard about it from some locals. It is run by two brothers, I think, with science backgrounds, who decided someone had to do something to educate people about the poaching of",
          "Something you do not expect to see, but if you have time stop there and see how in simple way, the family who works there have a great intention in the protection of some species in danger. A photo with the condors was awesome.",
          "We had a lot of fun here- the animals were well treated and the guide was very nice. We got to see pumas, condors, llamas, alpacas, dogs and parrots. The kids got to hold the parrots on their arms and after they were also allowed to carefully hold puppies. We had a great time!!",
          "One of the best things i did my whole trip, about a 30min-45min drive out of cusco, nice scenic drive. no entrance fee, runs on donations and a store they have. was greeted by a young tour guide, told us all about every animal in there, how they got there, if they can be",
          "OK, there were lots of cool animals. And they were well cared for. I just had a problem w/ the idea of whether this was how we, or al least American's, would view a \"sanctuary\". It had a very zoo-like feel. Can't believe the Pumas or Condors would not have been better served in",
          "Whever I travel, I try to support local animal charities, shelters, or humane organizations who care for animals. When in Peru, I looked for such a group prior to traveling and found this sole review for the Ccochahuasi Animal Sanctuary. I visited the sanctuary in May 2012 and",
          "Our guide asked if we wanted to visit a \"zoo\" on the way to Pisac. I was not so interested but she said it had condors and you could see the animals close up. So, we decided to stop not expecting much. We were quite glad we did. We were able to go inside the condor aviary"

          "It is a modest venue, but the program is rich in rhythm and color. More than 10 local musicians play for the traditional dancers. We bought our tickets around 6:00 pm, there was no queu at all. The seats are not assigned. The program is not announced, but there were around 8",

          "After reading the mixed reviews on trip advisor, I wasn't too sure about attending this show while finalizing the itinerary. I decided to keep it as a May-be activity and to go there only if I had enough time left that day. Well, luckily we were done with our tour early and had",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the Qosqo Dance Troupe. Our driver mentioned the show to us and said it would be a safe place to walk to from our hotel Novotel. It had been a cold rainy day in Cusco, so we were very happy to get out that evening and walk to the theater. We arrived just",
          "25 Sol, cash only, but lets be honest that is less than cost of a movie and for that you get an hour long show with a dozen musicians and 18 or so dancers and an explanation of each dance in Spanish and English. The venue is basic, and the lighting atrocious, but the dances are",
          "Arrived looking forward to the show, only to find out this is no longer included as part of the boleto turisto and we would have to pay 25 soles each, even though it is still on the ticket and we were not told when we purchased it that day.",
          "We went tonight and were told that from 1 June, this is no longer free with the tourist tickets. It's unfair to give this a rating as we didn't attend the show, but there's no way around it, so rating it an average.",

          "An entertaining show that should be put on the list of activities but only if you have spare time. Don't short cut an archeological site just to see this. There are talented performers and the work put into the costumes is clearly evident. But many of the dances are very",
          "Worth the wait in line to see the unique variety of native dance and costumes form Cusco and the surrounding area.",
          "Most of the dances were all the same accept towards the end, became a little more entertaining, music was nice. Part of the city pass or you can pay at the door, the host who came out in between every dance was very hard to understand her english, very strong accent.",
          "This was funny from start to finish (I'm not sure if that was the intention). Can best be described as having the feel of a school show.",
          "Not even worth it for free, or you might go for 15 minutes and then leave. Same dancers, same rhythms, very similar costumes and music -- we couldn't wait for it to end",
          "This is a fun evening activity if you have an hour. You'll see some traditional Peruvian dancers and learn a little about their culture",
          "I went using the ticket that I bought at Consituc, and I thought it was a museum, but it was actually a live show. It was pretty exciting! The dancing was very nice, the only thing that dampened my experience was that the presenter spoke poor broken English and it was hard to",
          "It is good value, free with your 'boleto turistico' or just a few USD dollars. It just goes for 1 hour, but they squeeze quite a few dances. There's a big queue, so make sure you arrive 20 to 30 minutes early.",
          "The show is included in the boleto turistico, which does not specify that this is a live show. That said, we were pleasantly surprised to find this evening entertainment. Be prepared for a long line on Saturday night, so get there early! The hall fits only 400 people and that",
          "We went on a Saturday night and were advised to get there at least 30 to 45 minutes early to get in line as the theater only holds about 300 people. We did, and there was quite a line when we got there, although we had no problem getting in and finding seats (the theater did",

          "this place is packed every night. the show starts at 7pm so get there around 6:30pm and line up. other person has to go and buy a ticket. there is a presenter who speaks Spanish and English but i didn't understand a lot of things she said about each dance.",
          "Good but dances are repetitive. We left after 40 minutes and presenter did not speak clear English. Be prepared to queue",
          "Before I do a review of the folkloric dancing show, let me provide some advice on how to skip the queues and get in for a lot less money. Before arrival we were informed we required one of the tourist tickets to see the show - these cost 150 soles per person, and allow access",
          "Cute show with lots of wonderful dances and costumes. I'd say the women's voices could have been stronger, but the show was excellent overall. It's included if you get the Cusco Tourest pass",
          "If you are into folk dances, this performance is for you. If you bought a Boleto Turistico which includes this performance, it's a way to see Peruvian folk dancing in a genuine unadulterated form. I do wish they improve the auditorium (which resembles a high school), the",
          "We went to this performance because it was included with the Tourist Ticket - an interesting hour performance of various local dances. Live band with a variety of costume changes. We showed up right when the show was starting and there were lots of seats.",
          "The show was included in the Tourist Ticket that came as part of our tour of Cusco, so we decided to go to see it on our last night in the city. The show started at 7:00pm and lasted exactly 1 hour. As the doors opened at 6:30, we got in line about 6:10, and were soon inside and",

          "This was a great evening. The show starts at 7 and lasts approximately one and a half hours. We enjoyed the music, the costumes, and the dancing, all of which were impressive. Since it is covered by the Boleto Turistico, the performance is free.The orchestra is quite large",
          "I arrived at just a few minutes before 7PM and had no issue with seating (although it was January). The show is included in the Boleto Turistico so it was essentially free. I'll admit it started to get a bit long at 1.5 hours, but I could have left at any point - as some did.",
          "The music and dancing were all great. The costumes were beautiful, the performers skilled, and there was a variety of types of dances performed. One reviewer warned that the show can get \"weird\" but I didn't see anything weird in the performance.",
          "This experience takes one back in time, to the feeling of the old town of Cusco and her traditions, now still to be found, but mostly in the countryside. The theatre is nice & old, and the live music (orchestra), dances, costumes and symbolism simply spectacular! Really",
          "Just a warning- this show can get a little weird-- especially for the younger ones. Overall, the show is a really good experience, and is really interesting and gives you a great glimpse of Peruvian culture. I highly recommend, but the building is not in very good condition and",
          "Great show with many dancers. The band played their hearts out and made the night very enjoyable. Lots of different dances from areas of Peru and loads of costume changes. Well worth a visit. A little costume museum at he back as well and cheap snacks for sale before the start.",
          "Glad we went, as dance is an integral part of their culture whether in city or remote pueblo. These dances are a bit happy face and restrained whereas when we saw some other dancers at a restaurant (La Cuzquenita) and in the street at Plaza de Armas on weekends, they were a",
          "Very touristy, really - but hey it's included in the Cusco tourist ticket so if you've got that, it's worth a couple of hours of your time in the evening. Doors open 30 minutes before the show starts, but the line outside starts at least half and hour before that, so if you",
          "This one and a half hour cultural dance show highlights typical Peruvian dances, and plays out several Andean life themes thru music and dance. The music is performed live and the dance troop is well rehearsed. I love cultural shows of this nature and, as this one is included as",
          "You've seen the sights, you've tasted the cuisine, now listen to the music and watch the dances! The show is part of the tourist ticket (boleto turistico) and performs once every evening at 7. Gate opens at 6:30 PM by which time a long line of tourists are already waiting so",
          "This attraction is a bit on the outskirts of Cusco's main square, but it is a nice breath of fresh air and a glimpse into modern Cusco. The place itself may seem a little seedy and divey, but everything inside is very clean, although outdated (concessions and restrooms). But I",

          "Not bad. Only about an hour show. Line does form before show so plan ahead. Some English translation but not consistently. Cheap entertainment if you already have boleto.",
          "This is a free performance for holders of the Cusco Boleta Turistico, starting at 7.30 pm. It's really worth making the effort to get there - the dances are amazingly complex and the costumes colourful and fabulous. The traditional musicians are excellent. There's a room at"

        "wiki": "Pikillaqta (Quechua piki flea, llaqta a place (village, town, community, country, nation), \"flea place\", also spelled Piki Llacta, Pikillacta, Piquillacta, Piquillaqta) is a large Wari culture archaeological site 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of Cusco in the Quispicanchi Province.\nPikillaqta is a village of the Wari people. Wari was the centre village and other cities like Pikillaqta were influenced by it. The Wari also inhabited many other sites around the area. The site was occupied from about 550 to 1100 AD. Its main use was for ceremonies and the site was not complete when it was abandoned.\n\n\n== Geography and environment ==\nThe Pikillaqta site is located in low ridges in the eastern Valley of Cuzco. (McEwan 2005:29) The area is hilly with no rivers, but small lakes are located near the city. The area is grassy, rocky, and sandy where the buildings were built. The site is 3,250 meters above sea level and is in the Lucre Basin. The climate in the area of Pikillaqta is cold and dry. Mid April through October is the dry season. November starts the wet season and the weather is milder and that goes until mid April. The average temperature high is in the 60s (probably Fahrenheit\u2026 so around 15 \u00b0C), and the average temperature low is in the 30s and 40s (also, possibly, Fahrenheit, that is, 0 to 5 \u00b0C) year round in the Valley of Cusco. The rainfall averages 300 mm a month in the wet season and 106 mm a month in the dry season.\n\n\n== History of excavations ==\nLuis Valcarcel discovered the site of Pikillaqta in 1927. (McEwan 2005:20) Extensive research was not done, Valcarcel just focused on the findings of two green-stoned figurines and his findings were not published until years later. Emilio Harth-Terre was next and published the ground plans of the site in 1959 but did not excavate. William Sanders looked at the surface remains of the architecture in the 1960s and split the site into more detailed proportions. He searched two buildings and only found a few artifacts. Mary Glowacki studied the site for ceramics in 1996. The biggest and most in depth research however was done by Gordon McEwan who excavated the site in 1978-79, 1981\u201382, and 1989\u201390. This is when the bulk of the material and questions about the site were finally being answered. In the 1989-90 excavation extensive research was done on the architecture and on trash middens. McEwan divided site into 4 sectors to research them more easily.\n\n\n== Agriculture and canal systems ==\nMaize was found in one of the excavations done by McEwan along with 20 well conserved beans. Maize was an important crop and was farmed by the people of Pikillaqta as a major food source. The Lucre Basin could produce this crop with all the irrigation systems. Maize was important to the Wari and was painted on pottery along with deities and supernaturals. Canals, reservoirs, aqueducts were at Pikillaqta along with terraces and cultivated fields. Pikillaqta economically controlled the area through agriculture. There was a hydraulic network in Pikillaqta that led through canals and agriculture fields to help the people. Water for irrigation was brought in mainly by the rainfall, which leads to the hydraulic system. August through December there was hardly any rain and the artificial irrigation system was used. December through January there was plenty of rain and artificial irrigation was not used much. May through June was the harvest season and irrigation was used when it was needed. Canals were built of stone and were connected to the Lucre River and Chelke stream. There is over 48 thousand meters of canal in the system with canal A and Canal B being the longest and connected to Pikillaqta. Canal A provided water for irrigation at terraces 1, 2, 3, and 4 and was connected to aqueducts. Canal A provided for the most important buildings in the center of Pikillaqta. All these devices aided in crop production and provided the people with water. In one unit of the trash middens two grinding stones were found and this was a rare find because of the scarce ground artifacts found at the site. This showed food was ground and prepared with grinding stones and they must have been around to help with food preparation.\nIn the trash middens at Pikillaqta 50,00 bones were found. Most of them were Camelid bones, with guinea pig and other small rodent bones found. Not much research has been done on them McEwan stated but this is some of the animals that were eaten at the site. Projectile points were found in the middens as well which could have been the tool to kill and prepare the animals. This was probably the meat sources for the people at Pikillaqta along with the maize.\n\n\n== Functions of site ==\nAt around A.D. 650, the Wari erected Pikillaqta, a huge fortified complex covering 25 hectares south of the Cuzco valley. Pikillaqta was garrisoned and all five entrances to the valley accessible from the altiplano were heavily fortified (McEwan 1996:169). Pikillaqta may have been also a large feasting site. There was a large patio in the middle of the architectural structure that probably was the center of the administrative rituals and religious practices. Rulers and their kin would come together and feast and drink, and with the capacity of the patio, Pikillaqta could hold a ceremony for people from other Wari villages. Great amounts of native beer (chicha) was drank. Maize and chicha were very important in rituals, they were sacred so they appeared often in ceremonies. Even though the patio was the main function of the ceremonies, other places of Pikillaqta show some important ceremonial use. Niched halls were important religious buildings also.(McEwan 2005:152) There were 18 of these structures. The halls were looted but they may have held sacred objects and offerings once. In Wari art, ceremonies were depicted with a ceremonial pole coming out of the center of niched halls along with offerings, plants, and felines shown in a sacred context. The functions of the niched halls then were probably ceremonially and ritually used because the halls match up with other Wari sites and art. Small conjoint buildings were also present at the site for ritual use.(McEwan 2005:158) There were 501 structures of these rooms. A small number of people could gather here for ritual feasting on a smaller more private scale. Sector four of the small conjoint buildings could have been a place where mummies were held and visited. Small fire hearths were found in them where offerings to the deceased could have been done. The Wari thought it was important to keep in touch with the mummies so they could watch over the living so they were regularly visited. There were four chambers included in the small conjoint rooms and one contained a large stone that the Wari couldn't move. They built their structure around this and the rock was then probably used as a sacred object.\n\n\n== Leadership and religion ==\nThere was no distinct evidence that showed inequality at the site of Pikillaqta but there were probably different classes. People of higher power and prestige would have been needed to watch over and control the events and ceremonies of the large-scale site. Evidence form other Wari sites would insist that elites or leaders would have held everything in check and working order. Kinship was important for the Wari. Many decisions and ceremonies were revolved around fictive kinship and ancestor worship. The main Wari deity in Wari religion was Waricocha. Waricocha was the \"staff god\" who controlled life and death. He was the creator of all things, the universe, sun, moon, and civilization. On pottery and in art Waricocha was shown with rods in each hand and with rays coming out of his head. These showed divine power and at the end of the rays animals, like pumas and condors, were attached along with maize.\n\n\n== Trade and specialization ==\nItems like turquoise bluish-green stone were traded into the area. They were used for figurines and bluish-green stone was not found in the area. Other stones, gemstones, and minerals were exchanged around the area and according to Anita Cook Pikillaqta may have been the center of the big trade network. The pottery in Pikillaqta was also traded in, Okros and Wamanga style pottery were two of the main styles and they were made around the area. Pikillaqta was one of the biggest Wari sites so other goods were probably traded in and out of the area and housed in the many buildings at Pikillaqta. Many people came around for the ceremonies so a lot of items were probably traded or brought in with them.\nSpecialization could be found in the bluish-green figurines found at Pikillaqta. Two different sets of 40 votive turquoise figurines were found in grave lots. This was an important number because it showed state organization as an administrative unit and rank. These were also the only figurines found so far from the Middle Horizon period. The figurines ranged in size from 18 to 52 millimetres. There were turquois processing locations and workshops at Pikillaqta. Stone carving was also present in the city and could have been a specialization. The architecture for the buildings would have needed long precise time to build because they are connected and so big. Specialization of bronze arsenic was also present at the site. There were many artifacts made out of bronze.\n\n\n== Remains found ==\nA few burials were uncovered in excavations at Pikillaqta. Two wall tombs, a couple offering pits, and one room held skeletal remains. In the niched halls (Unit 10), 10 skulls were found in an offering pit. Seven were found earlier and buried in red soil while 3 were found in gray soil and were untouched previous to McEwan\u2019s studies. A metal spike (bronze) was the only other object thing found in this pit. In another pit some bone fragments were found with green stains indicating they were buried with copper even though the copper was not present and a few shell artifacts were found. Looting was done at Pikillaqta and that\u2019s why many artifacts are gone or missing in tombs and graves. Buildings show signs of looting. The looters cleared out possible grave goods that could have been buried with skeletons, especially if they were valuables. In wall tomb 1 a man and woman were found. Small turquoise-colored stone beads were present with the bodies. The bodies were placed in the wall at time of construction in seated position. In the second wall tomb the body was seated up also but fell over at some point.\nFour nearly complete skeletons and ten other skulls were found at the site.\nWall Tomb 1 included adult male and female. The male was aged 35\u201345, had a healed fracture from blow to face, cranium deformation, and gum disease. The female was aged 35\u201350, had frontal flattening in cranium, and had more cavities and tooth wear than male found in tomb.\nWall Tomb 2 had a female aged 17\u201320. The bones were just stopping to grow showing the individual was young.\nThe partial skeleton from unit 49 was aged 16\u201318 and the bones were still forming.\nOut of the 10 skulls found McEwan looked at 3 of them. One had cranial deformation and another had three healed trephinations.\nNo clear evidence showed the signs of death in the few remains at Pikillacta, not enough research was done also to uncover more information on them.\n\n\n== Abandonment ==\nPikillaqta was occupied from about 550 to 1100 AD and around 1100 AD is when it was ultimately abandoned. Reasoning for this is not exact but it could have been because of a crisis in the empire or that the Wari were trying to expand somewhere else then planning to come back. There were two stages in the abandonment: the part where the Wari left and then a giant fire after that. The site was abandoned before much of architecture was complete. Sector 2 of site finished architecturally and used according to research. After that part was finished, sectors 1, 4 and then sector 3 were worked on in that order. In sector 1, two excavations showed that the interior walls of the structure were not plastered with clay or white gypsum. In Unit 47 there was evidence of an offering shown there so it was in the process of being built but not complete. Section 4 had most of the architecture finished with some incomplete walls and unfinished floors. In sector 3 Unit 34 showed little amount of completion; the building was full of sterile soil, the walls were unfinished, the floor was not laid, and the offerings in there were not placed in the corners. The door was blocked and sealed in clay probably because it was abandoned during construction. Abandonment occurred during construction of 1, 3 and 4. The sealing of a number of key doorways occurred so unwanted visitors would have trouble entering some structures. Some buildings were sealed off completely with clay. Valuable goods were not found at hand on site and this could explain why very few artifacts were found anywhere at the site.\nThe last part of the abandonment stage was marked by a massive fire. The Wari sealed up and tried to protect the site as if intending to return. McEwan believed after they left, local people wanted to destroy the site and set it ablaze. Completely carbonized beams and burning on the underside of floors suggests the fire was deliberate. Section 1 and 2 had been destroyed by fire. McEwan believed they were trying to expand their control and eventually the splitting of the Wari led to the end of the reign of the empire. After the fire looters at unknown times came through the site and got into some of the burials on site. They are the only known people to be active on the site before archaeologists investigated. Pikillaqta is open for visitors and tourists to view the ruins of the once large city.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChuqi Pukyu\nRumiqullqa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCook, Anita G., 1992 Stone ancestors: idioms of imperial attire and rank among Huari figurines.

          "I think it's really amazing to see that not only Incas were here. The site is hugeeee!!!! And it's excavated only in tiny bit which is a shame but then on the other hand it's amazing to see how the ruins are found. Fascinating!! Definitely worth seeing",

          "With all of the focus on Machu Picchu and other archeological sites west of Cusco this impressive site to the east is often overlooked. This is my fifth trip to the area and we just discovered this interesting site. When you arrive it is very understated and looks like there is",

          "I wouldnt go out of my way to visit here but if you are driving by and have an hour to spare then drop in and stroll around. You will need to use your imagination a lot to visualize what was here. A local Spanish speaking guide may help you a little.",
          "Among the best preserved pre-inka sites and included on the tourist ticket. Easily covered in about an hour and well worth stopping at to get a sense of wall construction with stones prior to the Inkas. The site is impressively situated with a view of the valley and surrounding",
          "If i told you you wouldn't believe, but this city had roofs above the streets! It was such an advanced city, well organized, clean and very developed. You walk a lot there but at the entrance there is a house where you csn go to the bathroom. There is also a small museum there",
          "Piquillacta is an unfinished walled ceremonial complex built by the Wari people (Pre-Inca) from approx. the year 550 to 1100. You'll typically be alone, or nearly alone here -- it is a tad \"off the beaten path\", but it is a great stopping point if you're travelling south to the",

          "This seldom visited pre-Inca site is just past Tipon and well worth the visit if you are going in that direction, this ancient walled city is interesting and a pleasure to wander. I especially enjoy walking the outer wall, kind of a miniature version on the Great Wall in China",
          "This site is quite large; we were the only ones there, and there were no guides and no information, so really not much idea of what you're looking at and what it was for. This site, being pre-Incan, was quite different from any of the other sites we'd seen in the Sacred Valley;",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "First off, if you are going to Machu Picchu, do yourself a favor and watch one of the many, many videos on YouTube or Google it or read a book. This museum has a couple videos running but, again, nothing any more educational than what you can find on the Internet. None of the",
          "I definitely recommend checking out the Machu Picchu museum at Casa Concha before starting a trek to MP. The museum is filled with all sorts of history and interesting artifacts found at MP. Looking back, the museum more or less completes the picture of Machu Picchu because it",
          "This little museum is not so little, it contains in many different rooms that surround the courtyard, the story of the discovery of Machu Picchu and has a multitude of artifacts, photographs, mini-creations of the site, as well as some multi-media videos of the history. It was",
          "Those who loved Machu Picchu - and those who are preparing to visit it - will find this museum invaluable - a gorgeous overview of the Incan palace, its history and its multidimensional craftsmanship - astronomical, architectural, agricultural. Its story is inspiring too:",
          "Go here either before or after visiting Machu Pichu to get the whole story of how the site was discovered and uncovered, the meaning of it, and a lot of what was recovered in excavating and developing Machu Pichu. Admirably curated and displayed.",
          "I visited the museum after having explored Machu Picchu. It is a wonderful complement to the experience. I particularly enjoyed seeing photographs of the site prior to its development. It makes you appreciate the amount of archaeological effort expended to see Machu Picchu as it",
          "The museum exhibits present a wonderful explanation of the history of Machu Picchu in both English and Spanish, complete with photographs, pottery, silver, gold and a complete diorama. We went after we visited the site. I would recommend 2 visits, both before and after you",
          "Whether you visit Casa Concha Museum before or after a trip to Machu Picchu it will be time spent. Housed in a beautiful colonial building this gem of a musuem is home to the largest collection of Machu Picchu artifacts in the world. Casa Concha is a result of an agreement",
          "We visited this museum several days after having been in Machu Picchu. Liked the displays and the model of Machu Picchu. Loved the photos of the Hiram Bingham expedition when they found Machu Picchu. I thought it was worth the time we spent.",
          "We spent an absorbing hour or two watching, reading and learning. It was very peaceful and we moved at our own pace. It helped us to appreciate Machu Picchu when we visited later in the week. The information is translated into English which was very helpful. The museum is",
          "My partner and I read Turn Right at Machu Picchu before heading to Peru (truly nerding out). We were so excited to get up there, but the lack of free / available information at Machu Picchu was such a bummer. You need to hire a guide, but there's no way to really know the",
          "It was just ok... Yes, it was informative, but if you don't have time to kill don't bother. You are better off enjoying the plaza with the views. My friend and I left in 15 minutes. We forced ourselves to walk through the entire thing only because we paid. Being out of breathe",
          "For those with some/little knowledge about Machu Picchu this would be a great place to visit pre or post Machu Picchu. I went after my visit and felt like it complemented my tour the day before.",
          "Located inside a small colonial building, this museum is fairly basic. Some photo's, artifacts, several dioramas and a few video's highlighting some of Hiram Bingham's visits to MP. Though not extensive, it's still interesting to see some background on the excavation. We",
          "Like some other reviewers, visited the museum a couple of days after visiting Machu Picchu. This is not the place that will give you a preparation to what you are going to experience in the Sacred Valley. You should get that from previous research from all sources available",
          "I visited the museum shortly after I had walked the Inca Trail & visited Machu Picchu, so it was very enlightening to get more of the history / background after just having been there. The museum is very well laid out & easy to get around. The Casa Concha building itself is just",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and found it complimented my visit to Machu Picchu. I was particularly interested in seeing the site as it was when first rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911. My only disappointment was that many of the items were not labeled in English.",
          "I visited the museum to prepare for my trip to Machu Picchu - learned very little, and paid more than any other museum in town. Not worth the time or money.",
          "This was a cute little museum, fairly bare bones but it had some good (basic) information about the Incans and Machu Picchu. It starts with information on the \"scientific discovery\" of Machu Picchu in the early 20th century and provides a basic overview of Machu Picchu and",
          "We visited this museum after having visited Machu Picchu a couple of days ago. We were expecting to gain a little bit more information about Machu Picchu, its history etc but the information in English was far from satisfactory. Some displays didn't have any English info at all",
          "After our visit to Machu Picchu there were just a couple of queries and going to this museum full of artefacts, photographs and videos with English subtitles was very helpful. It was quiet and we spent over an hour wandering from room to room around an open courtyard. Easy to",
          "Nice museum! it is interesting to see what they have in here worth your time and worth the entrance its not a lot!",
          "This museum is worth visiting, but the presentation is quite poor. As other reviewers noted, this museum is the new home for the former Yale Peabody Museum collection from the Yale Expedition to Machu Picchu in 1913. It's great to see the artifacts closer to their true home,",
          "We thought this museum was excellent - kind of surprised at negative comments. We came here after touring Machu Picchu, and it helped us understand more of what we saw there. Great video.. pictures... and actual documents from Hiram Bingham. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "My husband and I visited the Machu Picchu Museum on our last night in Cusco (after our trek to MP). It was very basic and given the opportunity, we would not return. I would also add that if you are not fluent in Spanish, I would not recommend attending - Only about 50% of the",
          "This Machu Picchu Museum is located in a previous military building. It is very interesting and a must see for Machu Picchu visitors. It provides a lot of information.",
          "Sine we were going to Machu Pichu were looking for more information. This museum was very basic and while it had some signs of explanation in English. They were minimal and at altimeter so small you needs cell phone flashlight to read them. The video was the best part all 5",
          "Spent a nice hour here looking at some of the 366 items taken by Hiram Bingham from Machu Picchu in 1912 and returned only fairly recently by Yale University. The pottery was fantastic, with some huge pots on view, as well as many items of jewellery, tools and skeletons. There",
          "This is not the best planned museum but several features stand out. There is a video that highlights various structures on a 3-D model at Machu Picchu as it went along. We enjoyed the artifacts that were recently returned by Yale in 2011 after being removed during the 1912",
          "Quite limited collection spread thinly over a large building. There's a typical Gringo Tax. Foreigners have to pay double, naturally, but English translations are deliberately printed on signs a fraction of the size of the Spanish explanations. Some of them are so tiny they're",
          "This is a great little museum where you can see all the artifacts from Machu Picchu that Hiram Bingham initially removed, and then returned to Peru. We went after visiting the MP site, and it is amazing to see how little things have changed since the 1911-12 time frame when it",
          "If you've read about the \"discovery\" of Machu Picchu by Hiram Bingham in 1912, this museum displays some of the objects he excavated which were returned by Yale University in 2011. The building is from the colonial era, and interesting in its own right. Visit this either",
          "There is actually less here than I expected given the massive rows over the stuff Bingham exported. The introduction film did not work. And although each room has English explanations and the films English sub titles the actual exhibits are only labelled in Spanish which",

          "Containing artefacts from Machu Picchu that were found by Hiram Bingham and recently returned to Cusco by Yale University. Open from 8am to 6pm but give yourself an hour to take it all in. Lots of visual video displays in different rooms, two story building but easy to get",
          "Having lived in a dorm called \u201cBingham Hall\u201d as a freshman, I felt the need to visit the Machu Picchu museum as an homage of sorts. This museum is based on the 300+ artifacts that were excavated by Bingham in 1912, then returned from Yale University to Peru in October 2011.",
          "As a minimal Spanish speaker, I was hugely disappointed in this museum. Much better videos are available on Netflix, and the artifact displays have few/brief explanations in English. The building is beautiful, and it's a shame there are no explanations of its history. Skip it.",
          "Very informative especially having already visited Machu Picchu. A great number of displays for those who want to visit before their visit to the actual site. The cost was reasonable and the text clear and concise.",
          "It sounds great, a museum about Machu Picchu, containing information about the excavation and site itself as well as artefacts which were taken by Hiram Bingham (Yale University) and returned in 2011. But what you get is actually quite little. I was hoping for much more but the",
          "Reasonably priced. Probably best to know a bit about the history of how Macchu Picchu before you'll get the most.",
          "I went there with high hopes and it turned out to be ok. It is not a must see but if you have spare time it is ok to check it out. It is 10 soles the entry if I recall ir correct.",
          "This is a great place to visit before you head to Machu Picchu with displays, pictures, and some videos; however there wasn't too much on display so I'm not sure it was worth the price we paid for it. It seemed that they might be adding some artifacts at some point.",
          "This is by far the best museum in Cusco. It has information about the Incas and Pre-Incan cultures that stayed there, with original artifacts from the first academic studies of it. It has great information about Hiram Bingham, the guy who first started studying Machu Picchu, and",
          "This is a small museum located very close to plaza de arias. It show you the history of Machu Picchu, how it was discovered, who did it and when it happened. It has a few videos and things found in the Machu Picchu excavations. When you are exiting there is this artist that",
          "This museum is small but informative because there are English plaques throughout the exhibits. However, the front desk is manned by people who speak only Spanish and even though I wanted to review and purchase a book, I did not because the books were behind the desk. The",
          "In Cusco, using up some free time between guided tours, and we hear about the temporary (?) Hiram Bingham artefacts and representations on display at the Casa Concha museum. So off we go. Just one of many museums and displays around the city, and this one is OK, like most of",
          "This museum is housed in Casa Concha, a colonial house, which was built on top of the site of the original house of Tupac Inka. There is an impressive collection of 366+ Incan relics, evidence of the original Inca construction and some atmospheric photographs of Haram Bingham",
          "It is the only interactive museum to learn about the discovery and the meanings of this place. Take about 2 hours to read listen and interact. Excellent museum and beautiful house.",
          "If you plan to go to Machu Picchu, without a guide, visit this museum first. It is a bit small, but quite intetresting, explaining how it was discovered.",
          "The museum (also referred to as the Machu-Picchu Museum) is located in a historic building near the Cathedral and Jesuit Monastery. Entrance is 20 soles (about $7). It is a small but well-organized display of the 1911 \"scientific discovery\" of Machu-Picchu by Yale historian",
          "After our machu picchu trip we were excited to come here and see some of the artifacts and read the stories of Hiram Bingham. But upon arrival we didn't see much. I would say there are only about 500 artifacts inside. The display and layout is very bad and the museum itself is",
          "You've seen the real thing, now complete your understanding at this wonderful museum. A huge array of Hiram Bingham's treasures, creatively presented, plus interactive video presentations and scale models that help you fill in the blanks. English and Spanish labels. Highly",
          "This is a small museum but very well taken care of in comparison to other museums in the city. It is a little price 20 soles, but worth visiting. The museum is in front of the Tourist office of Cusco and easy to find. They have information in Spanish and English.",
          "Very new museum containing all of the artifacts that were taken by Hiram Bingham and stored at Yale University until recently. There are informative films and interactive computer visits and historical photographs. It is located in a Colonial house built over an Inka site and",
          "After visiting Machupicchu, this Museum was recommended by our tour guide and it gave us a bigger idea of what we learned and saw during the tour in Machupicchu. A must see!",
          "interesting artefacts from macho picchu gives an insight into Inca building methods Needs a bit more explanation but found it worthwhile",
          "This was extremely interesting. Lots of interesting photos, videos and artefacts. The only negative is that some of the tools don't have descriptions in English. All the rest of the stuff is in English though.",
          "Indeed, this is not a very well appointed museum. I am sure Machu Pichu gave a lot more to show...but that is somewhere else in Peru and Yale University, not here. The best are the videos in the show rooms. Don't miss it if you go or went to Machu Pichu.",
          "The artifacts, dioramas, photographs & videos on display in this relatively new museum give life to the terraces, fountains & stonework of Machu Picchu. Apparently there will be more artifacts & exhibits in the future, but it is well worth the 20 soles admission now.",
          "I visited this in October 2014, having been to Machu Picchu itself on 20th October. The museum gives a good insight into Hiram Bingham's excavation of the famous Inca site. There good films and interactive exhibits. I also liked the display of ingenious Inca musical instruments,",
          "Even though it is small it has a brief history of Machu Pichu. It is located inside an old monastery, like almost every other museum in towm. It was on your own, with friendly staff.",
          "This museum is in the final formative stages yet it's very worthwhile. Located in a beautiful building, the museum contains modern displays, videos and interactive terminals. The displays and written descriptions will fill in some of the blanks in your knowledge of Machu Picchu.",
          "I visited Machu Picchu in October. It was a good trip. However, there were a lot of unanswered questions. My visit to la Casa Concha helped to \"fill in the blanks\", and things became really clear. It is very much about Hiram Birmingham's discoveries that were studied and",
          "Set in a beautiful building. What artifacts and photos that were on display were interesting. Especially coming here after seeing Machu Picchu first hand. Some artifacts were still stacked in corner rooms, waiting for their day in the limelight. It would be interesting to see",
          "Good place to learn about Bingham's \"discovery\" of Machu Picchu. Lots of photos by him and his expedition photographer. You should enjoy it either before or after visiting the actual site.",
          "We heard about this from our tour guide at G Adventures. I am also reading Hiram Binghams book Lost City of the Incas and was very interested in seeing the ceramics he collected from Machu Picchu. This museum only opened in 2012 so most people dont know about it, but it is",
          "I believe the items in this museum are the objects Bingham chose to bring back to Yale. While Peru \"loaned\" them to Yale, I don't think they were in a rush to return them because they kept them for the past 100 years. If you tour the museum site at Machu Picchu, you'll notice",
          "You learn nothing about Machu Pichu after visiting this museum. Misleading and insufficient information, you are better to read a book about Machu Pichu or search info on the internet! Waist of time and money (20 soles entrance fees)",
          "We did the Machu Picchu trip before coming to Cusco but now visiting the museum, I wish we had reversed the timing. Reading the Bingham book and seeing the museum gives you a totally different perspective. Even before you consider the artifacts, the original photographs are",
          "The Machu Picchu exhibit at the Yale Peabody Museum was always a favorite. When the artifacts were repatriated to Peru, I hoped they would find a good home. They have! The team of curators from Yale & Peru have taken advantage of the larger space to put together a coherent",
          "The Casa Concha is a fairly new museum and isn't (yet) marked on the standard tourist maps as a museum, just an old colonial house. Following the out-of-court settlement of the legal dispute between Yale University and Peru over the return of archeological artefacts removed",
          "For Machu Picchu travelers, this is a must-visit before, or after your trip to the site. The museum is only a few years old (opened in 2011), and it contains the archeological finds collected by Hiram Bingham that were recently returned to Peru from Yale. It's still a work in",
          "Worth the visit before or after your trip to Machu Picchu. I am not big on visiting museums, but this was very interesting. It was a bit of a shame that they did not display more information in English. We were left wondering what the significance was of some items. Clean",
          "Learnt about this Museum from our guide at Machu Picchu and then read the reviews on here. It really lived up to the expectations set on here, and so interesting to see how the site looked when Bingham first found it. Do stop and watch all the videos, they are really",
          "Read about this museum from other reviews on Tripadvisor. Trace the re-discovery of MP by Hiram Bingham and his crew and see the treasures that have been returned to Peru from the original expedition and much more. Totally worth it. Just off the Plaza de Armas.",
          "Having read a fair bit about Hiram Bingham's \"discovery\" of Manchu Picchu, we found this museum a wonderful addition to Inca history. We will go to Manchu Picchu tomorrow so found this particularly interesting...great photos of the site taken by Bingham as found in 1911 and",
          "We didn't even know this museum existed as its not listed on the Cusco tourist maps or lists of attractions. We only found out about it from our hotel clerk, and are we glad we did! Its a nice little museum, and very well done. The Bigham photos are interesting, and we",
          "I suspect that the administrators of the Casa Concha Museum have been paying attention to Tripadvisor and other visitor comments, because when we visited this very nice museum today we thought it was really great. Yes, payment is expected in soles, but this is Peru, and that's",
          "A visit here after seeing the physical site completed our experience. Communication at the front desk was a bit difficult and only soles are accepted. The setting and contents go well together and add insight as to what life was like at MP and more details as to how Bingham",
          "After visiting Machu Picchu in the flesh, it was interesting to see some of the original Bingham photos blown up. However there were few artifacts as compared to the Larco museum in Lima. Also, the English language descriptions were sometimes so tiny as to be unreadable in the",
          "After visiting Machu Picchu, I was very curious to know how the site looked a century ago when Hiram Bingham \"discovered\" it. This ten-room museum has those photos and a lot more. When Bingham went back to Yale, he took over 4,000 artifacts with him, but they were recently"

        "wiki": "Moray (Quechua: Muray) is an archaeological site in Peru approximately 50 kilometres (31 mi) northwest of Cuzco on a high plateau at about 3,500 metres (11,500 ft) and just west of the village of Maras. The site contains unusual Inca ruins, mostly consisting of several  terraced circular depressions, the largest of which is approximately 30 m (98 ft) deep. As with many other Inca sites, it also has an irrigation system.\nThe purpose of these depressions is uncertain, but their depth, design, and orientation with respect to wind and sun creates a temperature difference of as much as 15 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) between the top and the bottom.\n\n\n== Erosion threats to structure ==\nDuring the rainy season of 2009\u20132010, the Department of Cusco received high levels of precipitation that are atypical, which caused permanent damage to the ruins of Moray. The terraced levels of the complex, which are constructed from stone and compacted earth, were damaged extensively as the excessive rain waters undermined the ground beneath the structure.\nThe eastern side of the principal circle collapsed during February 2010, causing concerns about the permanence of the site as a top tourist attraction in Peru. A temporary wooden support structure was erected to prevent further collapse until reconstruction work could begin.\nAccording to travel writer Paul Jones, \"Although repair work at Moray continues to restore the site to its original state, lack of funds and continuing annual rainfall hinder progress. This interesting archaeological site which forms an important part of tourism to the region continues to be at risk of further degradation, should the repair work not be completed and maintained for the future years.\"\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThis landmark was likely used for farming, and soil samples have shown that soils were brought in from different regions to be used in helping grow crops at the different levels of the terraces. \n\n\n== See also ==\nVertical archipelago\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Moray (Peru) travel guide from Wikivoyage",

          "An ancient Inca food growing place. Both original and remanufactured parts are available. One of the places that shows how advanced Inca agriculture has really been.",
          "You learn so much about the Incas by going here with a guide. Everywhere we went to Inca sites we were amazed by their knowledge. This is an interesting site because it explains how they learned so much about farming. Well worth and hour or two of your time.",
          "While this site is amazing in itself, with the precision of geometry and the advancement of this agricultural practice - I do believe that the pictures do this one justice in a sense. As some other reviewers stated, if you are low on time I would consider skipping this one -",
          "It\u2019s not the only Incan site you\u2019d want to visit, but the agricultural gardens at Moray definitely add to the full picture of the Incan civilization.",
          "The Moray terraces are history significant in how the Incas advanced civilization grew their crops and implemented other agricultural practices. Other than that, the place is not really beautiful or otherwise special. It is ok to skip the Moray terraces if you are short on time.",
          "Another tale in the Inca story. Definitely not to be missed. Fits in context with Machu Picchu and the other Inca sites to understand the land of the Incas. Perhaps it was a botanical garden to scientifically examine what should be grown at various elevations. Or perhaps part of",
          "Better on the photos and packed since all the vans use the same spaces, the place would be worth an hour or so, there are more areas not seen from the almost parking lot.",
          "It never ceases to amaze me the genius of the early Inca population. Most likely by trial and error, their terraces were tested to produce the best crops at their optimum altitude. Sadly it rained the day I visited making the trail down to the Moray hazardous.",
          "This was one of our stops on our day trip around the Sacred Valley. We decided on booking a private taxi for the day (350 soles) to only visit the sites we wanted to, and to have our own pace. Moray was definitely a highlight for the day! Probably the nicest terraces we saw all",
          "We visited Moray as part of our visit to the sacared valley. The work to build the concentrict teraces is amazing. It was explained the Incas used for agriculture. The road is a 30 minute rough ride.",
          "Just perfect as we saw lots and our guide Carlos was just the best. He share so much knowledge of the area plus spoke English perfectly which made our day. We were picked up and dropped off at our hotel which was a bonus. Over all great day and great driver too!",
          "These circular terraces were built as a sort of agricultural laboratory where the Incas could experiment will planting and breeding different crops by planting them on the different levels of the terraces. The trail going all the way around the two terraces takes around 45",
          "I did not want to take a tour as a pat of general Sacred Valley because it then only allows for a short glimpse, but rather a tour which combines this site with Mara salt mines. Of course, the view of these terraced fields is beautiful in itself, but the main value is to marvel",
          "Visited as part of sacred valley visit. Circular terraced fields that function as some kind of planting laboratory for the ancient Inca to experiment with different crops. Was told that each level has a micro climate. It is amazing to see the circular fields. There are two.",
          "Patterns on the ground where ancient Inkans used to experiment with growing crops of various types suitable for various climates and soil conditions. A pretty large area, but the ground is even and not rocky so a good walking area.",
          "The place had an agricultural use but looks like an amphitheatre. We found it very interesting to see - the pictured one has been restored but there are others close by which are also worth a look.",
          "We stopped here on a tour through the Sacred Valley. The scale of the circles and the use they were put to hundreds of years ago is interesting to hear, but the circles are all very similar. If we'd spent more time walking around them, maybe I'd have rated it higher",
          "This was one of the most stunning Inca heritage sites I\u2019ve seen in Peru. By the impression, it easily comes close to Machu Picchu. And just to think, how comparatively fast this great culture with all its knowledge and skills was lost\u2026 Anyway, if in Cusco, just do not miss",
          "One of the best tours in Cusco/Peru. Is not so expensive and the experience was so fun and exciting. I believe we drove +/- 12km from the region around Cusco to Moray. To Moray to Salineras we went on a minivan.",
          "All kind of speculations for a Unique Inca site, but the explanations related with religious purposes or fertility. Farming terraces for worshiping built by the Incas in the 15th century.",
          "Walk around high above the agricultural steppes; observers can learn about how the Incan planted crops and measured the success at different levels as the temperature can vary greatly from the bottom to top.",
          "Moray, a remarkable agricultural center that demonstrates the ancient Incan's mastery of high-altitude crop growing. A large complex of terraced circular depressions in the earth which historians believe were used to study the climatic conditions on crops. As you descend each",
          "With our tour guide, we combined seeing Moray and the Maras Salineras Salt Flats. Both are worthwhile excursions from Cusco. The Moray site shows another angle of the Inca culture and perhaps how advanced they really were in establishing such an agriculture laboratory. Worth",
          "Moray is another example of just how brilliant and painstakingly precise the ancients were. The perfectly formed circles are one thing. But the fact that there is as much as a 15-degree difference between the top of the structure and the bottom, thus allowing the Incas to plant",
          "Amazing to learn about the Moray circular terraces and the importance of Inca agricultural research that took place here. Each of the terraces has its own microclimate and there can be anything up to 15 degrees difference in the temperature from top to bottom.",
          "The views driving there were just as amazing as the ruins. It is incredible to learn all about the Incas and how this site was discovered, used, and built. a must see.",
          "A week ago we visited this magical place called by our guide as the agricultural laboratory of the Incas, very charming thanks.",
          "Moray is an Inca archeological site, located about 45 minutes drive from Cusco. Maras (another somewhat popular sightseeing place - salt evaporation site) is located close to Moray. Majority of the tourists to Cusco don\u2019t come here, but is well worth the visit. We were an",
          "As we drove to the Moray Archeological Site, we passed snow-capped peaks. The Quechua consider these mountains as their protectors with the mountain Lord Ausangate and Pachmama (Mother Earth). These circular, terraced bowl-like structures at Moray, reminiscent of Greek",
          "When arriving on the site, you can easily walk around the 3 circles in the ground, the paths are good. Quite impressive to think that we still don't know what they were used for! If you are up to it, you can walk doe to Maras and then the Salinas, the way is wonderful!",
          "The Terraces of Moray is one of the must sees of the Sacred Valley. We visited during great weather and made the trek down. Very scenic and beautiful photos along the walk. On the way back up trek towards the back as you can see other terraces and more amazing views.",
          "After visiting the Inka sites around Cusco this felt like a real step up. The site has been well maintained and really powerful example of inka engineering but also ingenuity. We only walked through the main areas but you could spend a lot of time here getting into the",
          "In the Valle Sagrado,Sacred Valley there are a lot of really amazing things to see By 9 am with my guide we went to see the Salineras salt producing terraces It is neat to see the water coming from the mountains and irrigating The terraces and each family owns or works the",
          "Another amazing sight of the Inca empire. Before we went here we saw pictures and they were awesome but to actually be here and walk the site was incredible. You\u2019ve got to take a tour to see this place don\u2019t go by yourself. You learn so much in a tour and won\u2019t miss a thing.",
          "I've been to the Sacred Valley three times, but this was the first trip to see the Moray Agricultural Terraces and I'm glad I didn't miss them. We were 4 adults (ages 45-75) and 3 girls aged 12, 14 & 15. Everyone enjoyed walking around and learning about the complex terracing",
          "Many people miss the sacred valley on their way to Machu Picchu. This spot was incredible. Breathtaking and way bigger than you would think! An hour or so at the site was more than enough. I can\u2019t believe we only did this by chance - should be part of everyone\u2019s trip to Peru.",
          "If Moray is on the way then I guess I'd say to seize the day. Idk what I'm even saying after doing all that coke at the salt mines, but if it's on the way then stop in, otherwise I'd just keep moving. Not really much to see, just looks like a bunch of crop circles that the",
          "It is stunning and mysterious Inca ruin. It is also on the from Cusco city to Ollantaytambo. I used Taxidrum service instead of taking bus to here. One of the most remarkable feature of this ruin is the big difference in temperature that exist between the bottom and the top. It",
          "Peru is well-known for its many varieties of potatoes, all thanks to the incas in which they experiment every single thing out of their crops. It is with this depression craved into a massive landscape open air greenhouse. The incas was able to grow and cultivate plants or food",
          "Our guide didn't quite buy the \"agricultural laboratory\" explanation, but whatever these are they are worth the stroll. You can't walk down into them anymore, but there is a walkway across the middle where you can use the original Inca stairs, which are no more than stone slabs",
          "Put your walking shoes on for this one! Moray is an amazing site. When we arrived in early August they were having a winter festival here with an organized dance ritual in the circles of the Moray Terraces. They have this festival every year in the beginning of August. We didnt",
          "The Moray Agricultural terraces are an impressive sight. Good views from different angles and hight. Amazing when you think about how advanced they were in those days, The main attraction is well preserved. Absolutely worth while visiting.",
          "Not that far from Urubamba. This is one more thing that the Incas built about which we know nothing. It's fascinating listening to the guides explain the site but please bear in mind that it's pure conjecture, we don't really know. What we found most interesting is that usually",
          "You must take the time to see this. It is inconceivable how this was created - and why it was created. It does require some walking, but is not overly-strenuous. This is in a beautiful area, with views nearby of spectacular mountains and glaciers and valleys.",
          "Definitely take time to walk around this site. Take your time too as due to the altitude it may make you breathless. If the altitude doesn\u2019t then the ingenuity of the place will! Great views of the surrounding valley too.",
          "Stopped here as part of our sightseeing in the Sacred Valley and glad we did, but it didn't blow me away. The terraces are nice, some pretty pictures, the old stairs are pretty cool between the terraces (which we got to climb up). Be prepared to walk. If you're not super",
          "Really enjoyed my visit here. Scenically, it's just beautiful. High altitude so expect to be a bit slow if walking down to the bottom and back up again.",
          "We had the agricultural terraces on our bucket list and visiting them was well worth it. The site is big and very well preserved. It still gives a good idea how the Incas did their agricultural developments.",
          "A real \u201cwhoah\u201d moment as you look down at the circular terraces. Incredible and well worth the visit. You can spend anything from 10 minutes at the viewing platform or a good 2 hours here.",
          "This is an amazingly preserved Incan wonder. You have got to take a guided tour or you just won\u2019t be able to understand what it is all about. There are guides standing around for around $20-25 USD. Really good 1 hour ish tour of the area. Amazing.",
          "This was a great stop on our way from Cusco to the Sacred Valley. The terraces are beautiful. Definitely worth visiting - it was fascinating to see and learn more about the Incans.",
          "Regrettably, we were pressed for time and had to pull a Chevy Chase move. But what we saw in those brief moments was memorable and a remarkable human-engineered sight. We marveled at the terraces at Machupicchu but nothing quite matches the circular approach employed here.",
          "What a stunningly beautiful place, the history of why they used these terraces was very informative and the paths laid out where well worth taking, be careful with the altitude, this is very high and some of the paths are steep, I passed out myself going to fast !! take it easy",
          "We definitely learned quite a bit as we wandered around the Moray terraces. The Incan people are definitely impressive in taking advantage of what their land has to offer. Because of the difference in soil composition in these lands, these terraces allow them to grow different",
          "we have been late and wanted to take some pictures of the attraction with the last sunlight. They wanted to charge us 70 SOL for 5 Minutes!! So we did not ENTER. So this is one of the million of attractions of our beautiful world, we did not see. Like the churches in Cusco,",
          "Moray is normally omitted by the tourists while traveling to Secred valley but I think it is worth seeing. We hired a car for the whole day and after Ollantaytambo, we visited Moroy and from there we went to Maras. The entry ticket is included in Cusco Touist ticket and it\u2019s",
          "Another must stop in the area, beautiful terraces and shapes with a great history. Great energy in the area!",
          "There is an admission charge that is not included in the tourist ticket but it's relatively inexpensive. Not fully knowing what to expect, we were surprised at the beauty of the terraces. A large amphitheater contains huge earthen terraces in the form of concentric circles, with",
          "To adapt to the high elevation, we went on a Sacred Valley tour via Exploor. The historical sites are located slightly lower than Cusco so it was a perfect activity for us. Our tour guide Gris led us to Moray, Maras salt ponds, and Ollantaytambo. My favorite is Moray. Gris",
          "Located in the town of Moray, this archaeological site is about 28 miles from Cusco just west of Maras village. The circular stone terraces resemble that of amphitheatre. But there has been no concrete theory that supports why they were built except for celebration of",
          "As we travelled thru the Sacred Valley on the way to Ollantaytambo, our guide asked us if we minded making a stop that wasn\u2019t on our official itinerary. (We had just left an Alpaca cooperative where we\u2019d seen how this it is hand-washed, dyed, and woven into beautiful textiles.)",
          "Visited this site and was astounded, both by the quality of the remains, and more importantly, by the concepts behind it, as described by our guide. The concentric terraces, by having differing altitudes, sunlight and temperatures allowed the Incas to develop different varieties",
          "The symmetry and structure of these terraces are amazing. well worth a walk around the entire circumference as you gain the full benefit of the amazing scenery around.",
          "Interesting place worth visiting. The view from the top of the terrace is quite unique and grand. There's a path where you can walk down to the bottom of the terrace and the view from there looking up is just as impressive. Apparently this is \"laboratory\" which the Incas used",
          "We stopped by here with our tour group. There are 3 circular terraces. The largest one has been excavated, the two smaller one behind it - those two smaller one are not fully excavated yet. There are a couple of souvenir stands to buy gifts. Also go pass those souvenir stands",
          "This is a beautiful area, surrounded by incredible vista and views of glacier mountain peaks, located in the middle of no where.",
          "Beautiful agriculture circulars. We did not walk down and only saw it from the top. It is grand. However, some guide outside the terrace was asking us for 'unofficial' entry fee. Even for looking from the top.",
          "Our guide was a history graduate (now doing his PhD), and spent time explaining why and how the Incas developed these terraces. It's a bit of a white knuckle ride up the mountain from Ollantaytambo, but worth it for the views done.",
          "This is a beautiful site. We spent a half day visiting this and Maras salt mine. We hired a driver in Cusco to take our group around. This site can be self guided. No need to hire a guide or go with a tour group.",
          "I would have liked more time to explore the terraces, but we were on a quad bike excursion so only had about 20 minutes. It was fascinating to learn about how Inca's acclimatized their fruits and vegetables. Very interesting!",
          "This is definitely worth a 1-2 hour visit. The site is well kept and there is a nice path around it to get the whole view. Not a ton of explanation at the top but the views of the terraces are marvelous as are the views in 360 degrees around the site.",
          "The agriculture plots look other worldly but really showcase the depth of Inca forethought. There are 3 plots to view and it makes a nice little walk to see them all",
          "This is a marvel to behold. Worth it to walk around and see the 3 circles from different views. The surrounding landscape is also interesting to see on your way in and out of the site. You need an hour max to enjoy Moray. We had a lunch reservation at Mil so we timed our visit",
          "This was the best of our 1/2 day tour, and the one we wanted to see the most. No disappointment. Our guide gave a good description of the thoughts on what the Inca were working on in the use of these circular terraces. He said the various levels were used for distinct crops.",
          "The story of these circular terraces (there are five of them) is remarkable and an intresting stop in sacred valley. Inca civilization was quite fascinating and advance on how advanced their agriculture growing process was.Amazing landscape. It is believed it was once an",
          "Not in the centre of the main terraces but the small one adjacent to it. We listened to the wind, water and echoes of our voices. A wonderful and peaceful experience.",
          "The Maya civilization was very in advanced!! Moray was a laboratory for the kingdom. Several terraces, several sun orientations ... several climates so everything was possible, even coca leaves hundred of kms far from the tropical forrest. Just amazing, love this place!!",
          "Amazing landscape. It is believed it was once an agricultural laboratory used by the Incas for different crops at different heights. Not many visitors. Beautiful view and well maintained. It is thought that there may be underground channels because the area never floods. This",
          "Amazing how the Incas modified this natural landscape to be able to practice agriculture improvements with the small variation in climate between the top tiers and the bottom.",
          "This was a short stop during a Sacred Valley day tour - I'm glad we had a guide with us to explain the history behind each site. The terraces you can see in Moray are supposed to be an agricultural laboratory from Inca times. They experimented with different crops, altitudes,",
          "Stopped by here at the end of a Sacred Valley day tour and I was glad we did. The circular terraces not only looked spectacular but the history behind them and how the Incans experimented with different crops at the different heights, temperatures and sun exposure is fascinating.",
          "We had a personal driver for the day, and had done some research ahead of time so we felt that we didn't need a guide. The hike is down and then up. Take your time in the altitude. Combine this trip with the salt flats and chincherro ruins, or ollyantaytambo. Wear",
          "The story of these circular terraces (there are five of them) is remarkable. The Incas used these for agricultural research. They brought in soil from around their empire, and planted crops at different elevations and sun angles to see how they grew and what crop diseases they",
          "We loved the Moray Agricultural Terraces! It is gorgeous and an easy trip from the Maras Salt mines. We combined it with Maras and ollantaytambo. I would suggest a guide to help understand the ruins-it makes them much more interesting. Enjoy this gorgeous sight!",
          "Follow up your visit to the Maras Salt Ponds by continuing to the Moray Agricultural site. This was very good but I do think you have to go with a local tour guide (as we did) to get the most out of this site. I think if you go here on your own without much commentary you would",
          "These old Incan ruins are a must see whilst visiting the sacred valley and should be visited in connection with the salt mines at Maras. The terraced structure makes for a great picture and when taking a tour, a guide will provide interesting information as to its origin in",
          "These terraces were used by the Incas to develop growing techniques for different crops. It's amazing what the Incas were able to develop in the steep mountains of Peru.",
          "It takes a little drive to get here and the scenery along the way is interesting. However, this place is just so interesting. Not only the history behind the terraces but also the different climate zones, the drainage and just everything about this place is just amazing. What a",
          "Built supposedly as an agricultural laboratory, this is an impressive sight to see. You can walk around a the higher level to fully appreciate the scale of the circular terraces, and walk down into them half way. It\u2019s worth spending an hour exploring, but also the many",
          "If you are touring the salt ponds, there is a good chance that your tour will take you here as well. What is really neat about these terraces is that they allowed the Inca people to grown various crops at the altitude best suited for each particular crop by moving it either up",
          "Moray, Salineras and Chinchero together make a good day out. Get the Cusco-Urubamba bus to drop you at the turn to Maras town. There will be a lot of taxis waiting. A reasonable fare in a colectivo (shared) taxi to Moray and back is 10 soles. It's a long way. Your driver will",
          "Interesting to see coupled with a remarkable history of why the terraces were built. I was grateful that we had a guide who was able to provide the history of the terraces.",
          "Very interesting walk to see the 4 agricultural terraces. The day I visited it was wet and windy. Better to go down to see the different view of the terraces. the walk is Not accessible for wheelchair or for persons with limited mobility. The view from the top is also impressive.",
          "This site is thought to have served as a laboratory for growing crops in Inca times. It is a unique and interesting site. Still only 4 stars, because the tour I joined spent too little time here. We walked only along the upper part of the main circle, and along one of the two",
          "Interesting to walk around, and wonder \"why\". The guides indicate it may have been for agriculture experimentation at different altitudes.....weird because it's not that significant changes in altitude. Yet Macchu Pichu is 8k feet, and Cusco is 11k feet, now that's significant",
          "Well as far as researchers can tell, they think this was an archaeological site with concentric circular terraces. They practiced growing different things at different levels. The higher levels would be a higher temperature than the inner ones and could simulate the conditions",
          "They don't take any credit cards nor foreign currency. It's 70 sol/person. Kinda expensive compared to the living cost but it's worth it. Highly recommend to find a guide and listen to the explanation. It's breathtaking.",
          "Don't miss this place if you are staying in Cusco. Hire a driver if you want to, or take a tour. We don't like tours because we like to take our time and do exactly what we want so we hired a driver. We did mostly the level hiking because I have a problem with my knee but I",
          "Moray was one of the stops on our Sam Travel Peru Sacred Valley Tour. This archaeological site is just west of the Salt Mines in Maras. Concentric terraces, joined by multiple staircases, form a giant bowl. The largest depression is approximately 30 m (98 ft) deep. Our guide",
          "It is a great place to have a view of the Agricultural habits and methods. From the top of the hill it is possible to great a whole view of the site with the beautiful background of the mountains.",
          "Our guide with Gate 1 Travel gave us expert information about the use of these terraces in the study and development of seeds to produce greater food yields in various mountain conditions. They didn't need to conquer their neighbors, but invited them to join them and share the",
          "An incredible sight if an even more incredible achievement of the historical Incas. These circular terraces were used by the Incas to grow different crops at various altitudes and temperatures. A nice visit with many interesting viewpoints.",
          "Our group of 4 really enjoyed visiting this very interesting and amazing site. An amazing agricultural experiment by the Inca people and a tribute to their agricultural expertise. One should allow at least 1 hour to absorb and walk around this site at approx 3,500m. The walk",
          "Interesting to see the planning, work and effort to construct these multitude of sites but still can't understand why they exist. Too many theories, some credible, others, well not. Good spot to stretch your legs and walk around. Scenery getting here is wonderful.",
          "We had a guided tour of Moray and it really helped to open up this amazing find so we saved the best for last. From the parking lot, go to the right and see the sight counterclockwise so you see the largest of the 3 sites last. I think having a guide helps quite a bit her to",
          "We traveled the region with our two kids, ages 2 and 4, and this was probably our least favorite site to visit. Yes the history is fascinating and the construction is impressive, but this is literally the only place where we showed up, took photos, and kept going. We like to",
          "This is a fascinating site where the Incas created a kind of agricultural laboratory. The circular terraces in three different areas have been studied and found to contain a variety of microclimates. It was thought that it was here that they developed and tested different",
          "This place is a must see. A visit takes about 40 minutes to an hour. Archeologists think this was a laboratory for the inkas to experiment with growing crops in different climates. It's also very pretty to look at.",
          "As we drove through more of the farmland in the Sacred Valley I was pleased to see the light from the afternoon sun making the landscape come alive but unfortunately the Moray Crop Fields were deeply shaded making photography there difficult at best. In addition the wind was so",
          "It was amazing to visit this Inca \"experimental agricultural\" area. The incas built terraces at various levels to test what crops would grow best at what elevations. Each terrace consisted of four levels of matter...large rocks, pebbles , sand and finally dirt. The Incas seemed",
          "This was the site within the tourist ticket that I most wanted to go to. I did love seeing it but be warned that it\u2019s not quite as perfect as in the photos. However, there is also not only one set of circular terraces, as I\u2019d always assumed. It\u2019s far from where the local bus",
          "We almost missed this site, as we were focused on more well known places. Our driver suggested stopping here and Salinas on the way to Urubamba and our hotel. These concentric circles, like so many other sites, can only be appreciated in person, where the size of the",
          "The Moray Agricultural Terraces are a sight to behold. The terraces continue to drain today and the terraces are located at an elevation of approximately 11,150 feet. Well worth a visit.",
          "I recommend stopping by this site as part of a multi-stop tour as it doesn\u2019t stand alone worth a trip but it was definitely worth a visit. The site itself was fascinating to get to, tracking up a mountain but getting to see some more of Peru and it\u2019s countryside. Our guide gave",
          "Other reviews describe the terraced amphitheaters and their agricultural purposes very well. My experience also was well detailed by my driver guide. We had lots of time before my reservation at Mil Centro Restaurant which is also at the edge of one amphitheater. The perfection",
          "We did this in combination with the salt mines. Nice day and nice drive into the mountains. Super interesting.",
          "I think we only liked this because our guide gave us so much information. It's an archaeological site. The terraces were a series of engineered mini climates for adopting, experimenting, mixing, matching and cultivating foods, especially types of corn that normally can't grow",
          "We were on a schedule and only had a few minutes for this. Plus we were very tired after being up for 24 hours, already having done some hiking, and just getting used to the altitude since we'd arrived in Cusco a few hours prior. For us, taking a look from above was enough",
          "It is amazing how advanced the Incas were. This was more impressive in person than in the pictures. This is another must see!",
          "It is interesting how the ancient Inca culture was able to figure this out. Three set of terraces. One is 16 levels and due to the depth of each level has 16 micro climates. The Incas studied which plants grew best in which micro climate. Marvel",
          "Great archeologic site. Partially restored, great for us to learn about human civilizations. Amazing how much detailed and amount of information that the old ancient town for major agriculture and also the salt mine that is near by.",

          "This spot is absolutely gorgeous! The terraces are stunning to see with the backdrop of the Andes mountains! In my opinion this is one of the most unique archaeological sites in the Cusco region and should not be missed!",
          "The Bad: It's a bit of a drive out there down dirt roads, through gullies, one lane blind spot curves. Near misses of herded sheep crossing the road. The Good: Crop Circles! Beautiful scenery on the drive there. Get some great views of the mountains. The circle terraces are",
          "It's truly amazing how these terraces were developed to produce agricultural crops at different climates. Brilliant!",
          "I read in the Inca Museum that there is no scientific proof about the purpose of these terraces. One theory is that they were used to cultivate new crops/plants. The other theory is that this place was used for ceremonies. Anyways it\u2019s breathtaking to see these terraces. We went",
          "This was amazing to see! You first enter and drive up to a cabin looking ticketing box. You go buy your ticket if you haven't bought it yet (the cultural pass). No CC, just cash. Once you're done, you walk over to the ledge that's closest and when you look down you see these",

          "This is a major attraction up in the hills above the Sacred Valley between Cusco and Machu Picchu but still not to be missed. Because it's a major attraction, I suggest you get there earlier than later in the day. The day we went was crystal clear very cool in the morning",
          "Interesting how the Incas built this place, the terraces is supposed to create different micro-climates. However, there isn\u2019t much to see. We went as part of our sacred valley tour, it\u2019s worth it if you go to other places around the area as well, but not worth it by itself.",
          "Must be nice if you are not a part of a group tour and your guide is not rushing home or to get you to a store where his friends/family are selling souvenirs.",
          "I've always found the history of the Inca people very interesting. Actually seeing what they did in person is something else!! So much more to see in the Sacred Valley. Very cheap as well. Just 70 soles for a student for lots of the sites. Also 70 soles for adults if they want",
          "Extraordinary site with great photographic vistas . It\u2019s amazing how this was achieved by an extraordinary civilisation . The visit itself only needs to be short but the drive and views across the sacred valley and Andes are worthwhile in themselves",

          "This is worth a visit. The agricultural rings of Moray tell the story of the Incas and how they researched and decided on what plants grew best where. If you can, walk all the way down and then back up. Note the irrigation system. It is hard to believe but these rings worked for",
          "We drove to Moray on our way back to Cusco from Ollantaytambo. We were able to go around the terrace in 30 minutes. The drive to the terrace was more spectacular than the terrace itself. The beautiful snow capped Andes, the fields and meadows, driving through narrow roads was",

          "The good news is that this is a really interesting place with a cool history behind it, and amazing views. It's a good 1-1.5 hours to walk down and up. The bad news is that you must buy one of those rip-off tourist package tickets to get in! Cheapest comes at 70 soles and you",
          "When traveling from Cusco to the Sacred Valley, try to see this site. We came from ollantaytambo, and drove through a nice landscape before arriving at Moray. You can walk around and take some nice photo-shots. The circles are in good shape.",

          "This is part of our day trip, it's too far to walk from any surrounding towns if there is any. The place is amazing, it's a agricultural experiment of the Inca period. Picture cannot capture the depth of the terraces. A nice walk with your tour guide or friends is all it neeeds.",
          "It's a long way from cusco, but the photos don't do the actual size of this ancient agricultural marvel justice. Having a tour guide helps as they'll explain the different levels and the historical discovery and subsequent recovery of this Inca site. It's worth seeing in real",

          "These grounds are a bit of a trek to get to. But once there you will be amazed at the ingenuity and skills of the ancient people that created them. Several terraces, all with abit of a different angle or slope or soil, to maximize their growing of crops. Don't we only wish that",
          "This is very unique place, a remnant of the Inca times. There are several circuits that allows you to explore as much or as little as you want. Be sure to include nearby Salineras de Maras after or before you visit Moray. The only downside is that it is not possible to visit",

          "We took a collectivo (6 soles) from Cusco to the crossroads of Moray, found another collectivo waiting by the road - which turned into a taxi- that took us to the entrance of the Moray ruins (20 soles). We got there around 8 am and were pretty much by ourselves. The entrance is",
          "The history of this site is more interesting than the site itself. It is very photogenic and worth a visit. It doesn't take a long time to see and wouldn't make a lot of sense unless you have a guide explain it to you. Even then a lot of the explanation appears a bit more",
          "Have been here six or seven times and it does not get old. Well worth seeing, but only if you read up on it first. Bring a camera and sun screen for sure. Easily worth one to two hours of your time. After Moray, stop by Maras too!",

          "The agricultural terraces here are stunning. Learn about how the Incas studied ideal temperatures, moisture and soil for each crop and planned their terraces accordingly. Their irrigation techniques are marvellous. Be prepared for a long queue for the bathrooms, which may or may",
          "One of the popular tourist sites from Cusco is the Moray agricultural terraces. Most local tour agencies will be able to book a tour to this park and the general tourist ticket will include the entrance to the park. This park consists of the crop circles or agricultural terraces",
          "It was amazing to see and hear what's behind those circles and stairs...when you are in Cusco and you are not only interessted by rushing to Machu Picchu, then a tour to this place is recommendable.",
          "We took a side trip here from Olly and thought it was a very interesting site as the Incas used it for experimental crops (to see what would grow at different temperatures and elevations. It's impressive.",
          "We did it as part of a Moray/Maras tour for 65 soles. I think you might be able to find cheaper if you looked around. Seeing it in person was pretty amazing thinking about the ingenuity of the Incans in agriculture having different terraces to acclimatise crops.",
          "The Moray agricultural terraces were experimentation laboratories where the Incas studied the growth of different plants at different altitudes and temperatures. It shows how smart and sophisticated they were. It's a hard to get there place (non-paved roads) but very well",
          "We visited as a stop on the way between Cusco and Ollantaytambo. Give yourself at least an hour to walk around and appreciate the whole site. We loved the beauty of the concentric circles and the steps placed between each level. Great views of surrounding mountains. Don't forget",
          "We thought it was a temple or theatre until our guide gave us an excellent explanation as to the purpose of the terraces.",
          "If you are staying in Cusco it's an easy day out. We booked a day trip at one of many places who offer these things - It was cheap and well organised apart from a bit if a long walk to the bus. The guide spoke in Spanish and English. Moray is extraordinary with tiers for",
          "We hiked from Urubamba up to the salt ponds and on to the town of Maras. We rented quads in Maras and took a beautiful ride over to the ruins at Moray. We did not yet have a tourist card or \"boleta\" so we bought the 2-day pass for 70 soles each (around $21). It takes maybe 30-40",
          "This I recommend to visit with a tour guide (should be about 20-25soles with a group). This place has so much history and details. This place has 3 pits. One big that's 95% restored and 2 that are still quite original for now. According to our tour guide: this place grew",
          "An interesting archaeological site that we visited as part of a bus tour. Not the best place we saw in Peru by any means, but it certainly helped educate us on the scientific prowess of the Incas during the 1500s. We walked around an impressive system of terraces laid out in the",
          "This site is truly fascinating. The Incas built the terraces as a laboratory where they studied the effect of different climates on a variety of plants. The temperature is substantially different from the top of the terraces to the bottom. The terraces allowed for proper",
          "Worthwhile to check out the Moray terraces with the boleto ticket. You can walk down to the first terrace and back up again. It's a slow descent and ascent. There are bathrooms on the premises too.",
          "Together with Sacsayhuaman and of course Machu Picchu, the terraces at Moray were, to me, the most impressive of the Incan sites I visited. I did not read about this site before going, so I was spellbound as the guide related how archaeologists and scientists unraveled the",
          "The geometric patterns of these agricultural terraces are beautiful. The fact that they were built to acclimate various seed crops to different climates is yet another example of the incredible advances made by the Inca civilization. Though the location is a bit out of the way",
          "We saw the Moray Inca site the same afternoon as the Salt Mines. We hired a driver to take us there and back from Cusco and it is doable to do together. We did not feel rushed and were really amazed by both sites. Moray is beautiful and while we were disappointed we could not",
          "What distinguishes this site from other Peru ruins are their circular terraces that looked so beautiful and organized. We heard that this was used by the Incans as an agricultural testing ground. The system of circular terraces descends 150 meters from the ground level where we",
          "I talk the tour to Moray and the salt mines- half day, from Cusco. It was great, the Moray Agricultural Terraces are awesome and very interesting to know about the Inca ways to grow plants.",
          "This site was impressive and very interesting. We had an awesome tour guide that knew a lot about the site and it was a very informative experience. The size of the site and the hidden symbols (man and woman) were impressive to see. The background about the purpose of",
          "Great archeological site to visit. We walked around the 3 bowls where the terraces are all amazingly in tact. It was a shame you can't go down into the bowls any more but understandable to preserve them. Must see place",
          "Enjoyed a half day at this beautiful site. It was a very hot day and there is little shade here so keep that in mind. Amazing to see the salt terraces and how they have been there since Inca times. It is a climb but worth it. I got 3 bags of salt for $10.00 which is a good deal.",
          "I went here with a private driver from taxidatum. He also gave me very good information at the site, so I did not need to hire a guide. I do think it is essential that you have someone explain the site, official guide or not, so you can make sense of what you are seeing. It is",
          "Went there with a tour and I was impressed by the way the Incas used this place as a lab to grow different types of plants due to the difference of temperatures at each level. I highly recommend it.",
          "Inca food lab! It's hard to imagine that the Inca people could experiment with micro climates, really amazing. I would suggest a guide for Moray, in order to understand exactly what was going on here. Also a great pair to seeing the Salt Mines in Maras.",
          "You only want to do this event with an experienced guide who can explain to you what the deal is with this site. The things that they did to modify temperature and such are so cool.",
          "This is just one of many examples of the amazing things the Incas did without a written language. Not only is it in a beautiful setting, it's an amazing example of fairly sophisticated agricultural research long before European were doing anything like it. Very well worth the",
          "Nothing is confirmed on what it really is this for but they say that its an experiment for agriculture. Cant believe they thought of this thousands of years ago. They were advanced for their time. Nice to see. To the drone flyers, sorry no fly zone here. Big sign when you enter",
          "We stopped here on a 4-wheeling tour. It is neat to see the terraces & how they are in a circular shape vs other non circular inca terraces we'd seen on our trip. If you have the tourist ticket this is one of the locations you can see for free with it.",
          "Moray of Maras is an archaeological site that is quite unique and different from the other Peruvian ruins. It consists of (only) three large terraces, each looking like an amphitheatre and consisting of concentric circles which get deeper as they become smaller. The bigger one",
          "These concentric terraces seemingly provided microclimates to facilitate research into suitable areas for growing specific crops. Given their age they suggest that the Inca society was well advanced in comparison with contemporaneous civilisations.",
          "Using 3 different natural depressions built up of terraces at different altitudes creating separate micro-climates, they were growing and breeding different varieties of plants and creating new ones. There are 1000's of varieties of potatoes and 100's of corn in Peru alone.",
          "Visited as part of a day tour of the sacred valley. It's a very interesting site showing how the Incas experimented with agriculture using terraces. It's at high altitude so be patient and walk slowly as there is a bit of uphill. Quite a few interesting birds were spotted there",
          "if you are used to Roman and Greek architecture you may think this looks like an amphitheatre. In fact it was a horticultural experimental centre focussing on the temperature gradient over the different layers. It's in a beautiful setting and well-worth the visit.",
          "Moray is a proof of architectural genius of Incas. When you learn about the purpose of the terraces and whole drainage system, you cannot help yourself praising that great civilization, so do not go there to take pictures only, although the place is very photogenic. The best way",
          "This park and the closest archeological park of Checoq (a very nice unmarked inca site for storing the crops grown in Moray) are real gems to visit. Moray specially because it combines visual and amazing engineering feats",
          "The level of ingenuity of some of the Inca rulers was amazing and this is a masterpiece of agricultural engineering incredible circular terraces in different diameters and altitudes so you could plant different crops for different temperature levels. Visually beautiful and a",
          "I was impressed by this arquitectural place built by the incas! Is part of the tour if you go to the Salt Mines of Maras. The cost of the entrance is 40 soles. This place is 1 hour away from Urubamba.",
          "We visited the Moray Terraces or Inca Ruins of Moray and were captivated by this sacred place. We were taken their by our local guide and it wasn't very busy (kind of off the beaten path... not sure many know it is there). The perfect circular patterns are amazing to see in",
          "We had a guided tour of the terraces at pisac the day before so we were familiar with the Incan farming technique. If you only have time for one there is much more to see at Pisa and it is paved roads the whole way. Moray is scenic but probably best combined with other",
          "This is a set of three terraced circular depressions, up to about 100m deep which I believe were used by the Incas to provide the correct climate conditions for certain crops to grow at that altitude. Interesting to see and take a walk around - you'll note that some of the",
          "Definitely worth seeing if you are visiting the Sacred Valley. Most tour companies offer this sight along with Maras' salt mines. The grass is especially green during the rainy season, and the sight is visually stunning. I recommend taking the time to hike the area with a guide",
          "Let me start off first. To those of you who found this page, kudos. This is the correct page for the Agricultural Terraces. If you want to read more reviews about the terraces, head over to the Moray Adventure page. That page is misleading! All the reviews there are about",
          "Visited Moray as we had some time in the region after visiting Machu Picchu. We went with a guide (Condor Travel) and were very impressed with the site. It was explained to us as a sort of agricultural laboratory for testing crops in soils, altitudes and microclimates. That",
          "Although we hiked to most of the Sacred Valley's attractions, we were happy to cab it here; it's quite far out. You can cover the site in about 40 minutes; longer if you want to linger and take lots of pictures. I can't imagine anyone going to Peru without visiting this",
          "This was stop #4 as part of the day tour with Cusco Local Friend. It is quite impressive. We descended into the area in the late afternoon, and you can really notice the temperature changes. Our private guide, Hugo, explained that they think the Incas used this to study the",
          "really nice ruins . Trip up the mountain is very rough in a one lane dirt road. Probably would not visit again.",
          "This was set up as part of our tour of the Sacred Valley. We'd taken a long ride up the mountain in BFE from Ollantaytambu to get to this place. As explained to us from our guide, this was basically a place the Incas used to acclimate different crops to the altitude that had",
          "This is in the middle of no where, the terracing was quite impressive. But I think I would of rather have gone to the salt flats.",
          "Worth a visit to this beautiful well designed circular terraces in the heart of Sacred Valley. In May the grass is green. We hired a car from Ollantaytambo. The drive is scenic along the way and going through Urubamba town. Altitude is 3500 meters. We really enjoyed the",
          "Moray was such an incredible place to see. Pictures do not do it justice! It is so large and complex. My only complaint is that I didn't have more time to explore! The complexity and reason for this structure is truly remarkable.",
          "Moray is a very cool and almost unbelievable terrace system that traverses deep down in the ground. It was thought to be used for agricultural purposes of cultivating different foods/plants at different heights/temperatures. If you walk around the rim of the site you get a",
          "We came here as part of our Moray Moras Day Tour with Alpaca Expedition. Our tour guide Jaime was a wealth of information. Everywhere he took us. he was giving us so much history. He spoke very well English and answered all our questions. He did an amazing job telling us the",
          "This is a really interesting site, it is comprised of three sets of concentric circular terraces, the best of which is in perfect condition. Each terrace is about 1.5 metres above the lower one and they were all irrigated. In this way the Incans were able to establish a",
          "For me, this wasn't worth the entrance fee... it was certainly cool to see but there weren't really any explanations or much to do. (Maybe it was our guide? But we had the same guide for the salinas which I enjoyed and it was much cheaper)!",
          "This place is very strange and inspiring. You are constantly wondering what the terraces were for and I'm sure they were for agriculture. Didn't really get long enough here.",
          "We went on a day tour of the Salinas de Maras and Moray Circles together and it is one that I would highly recommend. We were impressed by how vast and how beautiful the agricultural circles were. If you are in the Cusco Region, this is a site not to miss!",
          "There are so many fascinating Incan sites to visit in this area but we found this particularly amazing. We didn't spend a lot of time here but it was well worth seeing just how ingenious the Incans were. Toilet facilities were under repair but there were more facilities a little",
          "This was an amazing place. The whole concept is incredible. It was huge and so interesting. The concept makes so much sense. I found this to be a strange place ; who thought of this. There was a group of musicians near by playing traditional music that added to the ambiance. I",
          "We had an amazing time and we would highly recommend it to others. My pictures don't do this place enough justice. Just beware, lots of stairs and thin air. Take it slow and easy the church is also beautiful",
          "Visiting the terrazas is something unique. Important to get a guide to really understand the purpose of the terrazas and its usage by the Incas. You can walk all around",
          "Toured with group without understanding exactly what they were before arriving. Our wonderful guide explained how resourceful and innovative the Incas were in testing different growing conditions in the same area by using layered levels. Great to see",
          "This is an archaeological site, approximately 50 km northwest of Cuzco and west of the village of Maras. In a large bowl-like depression, is constructed a series of concentric terraces that looks like an ancient Greek amphitheater. this was an experimental agricaltural site,",
          "We hired a driver to take us to Moray and the saltimens for $45 Sole. He spent about 5 hours with us. Well worth it. Moray is an incredible example of human ingenuity. The site was na agricultural laboratory. We started to question whether or not aliens had anything to do with",
          "Engineering marvel of the Incan empire. Very interesting how they could construct such precise agricultural areas. Lots and lots of steps. Just to note, there is a bathroom available here, but i think it isn't always in working order.",
          "We arranged for the taxi service Taxidatum to pick us up at our hotel in Ollantaytambo to drive us to Cusco. We stopped at the Moray terraces. It was interesting to see the concentric terraces carved into a huge earthen bowl. Each layer has its own micro-climate according to",
          "My wife and I visited while in the sacred Valley. We took a taxi from Urubamba and enjoyed about an hour here. It seems that in order to get any information about the terraces, you need to hire a guide. My wife and I chose not to do that, and I wish there was some information",
          "It was fascinating to know that these were used as a lab to grow different varieties of potatoes and grains. They are well maintained and a nice visit.",
          "Moray in February is green and lush, beautiful and not crowded! Our pictures are much more beautiful than the picture above. Travel February-May!",
          "It's amazing agriculture landscape. You can walk around above area but can't walk down to centre. It's a must see in the Sacred Valley, don't miss it.",
          "With Pissaq, CUsco, Machu Pichu etc. This archeological site is a definite must see in the Sacred Valley. So intriguing to see that they were doing OMG reserach here back then! it seems that this is where they have acclimated the coca plant to grow it at Machu Pichu...",
          "Beautiful to look at and even more impressive when you learn they were created for agricultural development. Make sure you understand what you are looking at. If you go without a guide, study up on the design and function of these facilities.",
          "This a very interesting site of Inca and how they may have developed with agriculture in the area. Our guide explain the theory of how may have been develop. Easy walks most the way around and down with some steps.",
          "The Inca civilisation were truly amazing. To build these agricultural terraces which give individual microclimates on each terrace is remarkable. With irrigation down the centre line every detail has been considered. If you're staying in the sacred valley this is another must",
          "Your imagination can soar when you see the terraced land of Moray. What were they doing here? Lots of conjectures about agricultural experiments in what looks like an enormous amphitheater. Peru is amazing and this is another one of those scratch-your-head attractions.",
          "One really does wonder how these spots were chosen back in the day. Moray is in the middle of nowhere but it is worth the trip if you are doing a day trip to see the outskirts of Cusco. You will need a car and/or driver. We chose the latter and it was well worth the effort.",
          "Really worth a visit. Aesthetically and historically interesting. The terraces are a site to behold, and they fact they were constructed under radically different technological conditions renders them that much more impressive. The park itself is amazing, but the surrounding",
          "Our taxi driver included this stop on a trek through the sacred valley. We discovered that there was only an option to purchase admitance to the location in conjunction with many other sites. We were unable to schedule visits to the other sites and felt the cost was too high",
          "We visited Moray with a Nat Geo Tour. The guide told us about the history of the site including its role as a possible Inca 'agricultural research lab'. The surrounding view of the Andes was breathtaking.",
          "After visiting several sites in Peru were were pleasantly surprised to come across this very unique site. Part of Tourist ticket. We visited with our driver/guide Oscar of Exclusive InkaTour who I would also recommend.",
          "This location is definitely interesting but without a guide you wouldn't really know what this place was. It's only good for a short visit and it isn't really convenient so I wouldn't particularly suggest it unless you were really into that sort of thing.",
          "This is a must-see for any gardening enthusiast. What the Inka accomplished in this little valley outside of Chincheros is simply amazing.",
          "Here is an example of the Inka changing growing conditions for plants one ringed terrace at a time. The idea that they had figured out how to mimic climate from varying areas of the empire in this one isolate valley impressed me more than I can explain, but just know that",
          "It was worth to go, very impressive. Had an interesting time there. Unfortunately no guides there so I used expalantion of a travelling guide book.",
          "The best part was the long drive out to the site on winding dirt roads with remarkable views of the valley, but the site itself didn't particularly take my breath away or blow my mind like Pisac or Olly or \"Sexy-Woman\". Basically it's a circular series of terraces, that's it, no",
          "You are amazing buy the level of scientific research done by the Incas over 500 years ago. The four terraces are incredible",
          "We trekked from Misminay to the Moray and onto the the Salt works. These terraces were outstanding and a sight to behold",
          "A little ways out of Cusco, we hired a van and a tour guide for a day trip. The drive there is extraordinary, through high Andes and small villages. Once there we were taken with the sense of place and the rounded, female lines of the ruins. Once used as an agricultural lab",
          "Very Windy and cold place at 3500 meters (about 12,000 ft) above MSL. Better be Protected from Wind and Chill even in early November. When you look from top it looks like a Colosseum. But what you see are not sitting galleries but they are amazing Agricultural Terraces created",
          "The site is an amazing glimpse into the wisdom of the past lost to us. It's geometric symmetry and 15-degree temperature difference the topmost and bottom terraces may hide more mysteries we are yet to discover",
          "This place doesn't sell individual tickets. We drove here and didn't get to see it as they wanted us to buy a 70 sol ticket per person which included 3 other sites we had already seen and they refused to sell individual tickets. This also applies to few other sites. Make sure",
          "This site is an archaeological curiosity where the Incas were thought to be experimenting with agriculture and getting various crops to acclimate to higher and higher elevations. A fascinating site surrounded by spectacular Andean scenery. A very worthwhile stop on your way to",
          "Not too long to walk all the way around the edge of the site and back - you\u2019ll be grateful of this thanks to the altitude, so take it easy. Otherwise, the photos speak for themselves. Queues for the toilets were long. Spectacular drive up there up the Sacred Valley too.",
          "I really recommend this site if only to get a sense of another form of terracing used by the Inca. This area becomes even more interesting when you hear the theory that Moray might have been an agricultural laboratory to learn which plants grow best at what altitude and moisture",
          "We visited here late in the afternoon, as the sun was getting low, beautiful views and very few visitors - it felt like we had the place to ourselves. It was much larger than I thought and it took a while to walk around the site. Wish we had a little longer to visit here.",
          "We visited this site as part of a day trip into the Sacred Valley and were not disappointed. The views of the terraces were amazing and you could walk down into the bottom terraces. The most unforgettable thing for me was the Incas knowledge that if they spaced the terraces out",
          "You see agricultural terraces all over Peru, but these are different because they are circular. They are also reconstructed so that they are in great condition. It's a lovely visual. It makes the imagination pop with ideas on how the ancients might have lived. Definitely really",
          "Beautiful place, wonderful views and full of history. A must see in the Sacred Valley! I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. If you can, get a tour guide because going on your own won't cut it - to appreciate the place, you have to understand how it came",
          "Visited Moray as part of of tour of the Sacred Valley and what a beautiful place! When I received the itinerary I had no idea what to expect so it was a good surprise. There is a lot of history and it is very interesting to hear how this place was used as a laboratory of",
          "If you are in the Sacred Valley this is a must see place to stop. The Inca people built this incredible series of terraces into a natural bowl in the ground, the scale of it is vast. Most fascinating is that each terrace is a degree warmer than the next so they had created a",
          "Worth a visit! Along with the Saltinas Maras (salt fields). Very cool site & interesting history behind the layers thanks to Wikipedia. The cost was the one let down! 70S!!!!!!!!! In Peru that is astronomical! It includes entry to three other sites which are all extremely far",
          "Very unique terraces. Something different from all the ruins that we saw. The view looking down from the top was so surreal.. My family and I hiked all the way down and up again. It was \"SOME\" hike. When we were at the epicenter of the terraces, we laid down and looked up.",
          "The ruins are another example of the incredible ingenuity of the Incas. There are no informational signs, so a guidebook or guide will add to your understanding. The hike to Maras from Moray is really great. There is a relatively level dirt path that winds through farmed",
          "This is another of the many Incan ruins open and available for exploration. Our Gate-1 tour guides did a great job of explaining the current thinking of the purpose of these terraces in Moray. Go with a guide and give yourself at least 1.5 hours at the site to explore all four",
          "Parque Arqueologico de Moray is a must see in the Sacred Valley and is a highly sophisticated Inca agriculture system, which is still an inspiration",
          "The Moray agricultural terraces reached a high level of perfection in in Inca agriculture practice. Temperature differences unto 15 degree celcius could be reached to grow different kind of fruits and vegetables. It's still a source of inspiration.",
          "I am sure I wasn't able to grasp exactly what this was or how it was used in detail as it still haunts my mind. I know what the guide said and that was amazing but I can't help to feel that something incredible is being missed.",
          "A stunning Inca site composed of 3 large bowl like depressions, the largest made up of 7 perfectly circular stones terraces. These were used for agriculture where the Inca created micro climates on each terrace as the temperature can vary by up to 8 degrees C from the top",
          "After hiking a good parts of our trip, we were happy to not have to do much hiking to see this awesome place. It's so interesting the history behind the terraces. Definitely listen to a guide or do some reading beforehand to truly enjoy the site.",
          "We visited here as part of an ATV ride with Maras Adventures. Our guide explained the purpose and construction of the terraces. It's truly amazing how these were made and used so long ago. The precision of the construction is incredible. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "If Moray does not convince you the Inca were agriculture geniuses then nothing will. It was very impressive to look at the terraces they created with micro climates to explore hybrids and enhancing their ability to produce food. I highly recommend visiting with a knowledgeable",
          "These agricultural terraces at Moray were incredible. Very unique, and very interesting. Except for some of my pictures from Machu Picchu, the pictures I took here were the ones people back home asked me about the most.",
          "These terraces are believed to have been used for agricultural experimentation. There are micro-climates on each level and the Incas likely used them for growing different plants. From top to bottom the temperature difference is 27 degrees Fahrenheit. There are no records that",
          "Part of the sacred valley tour. This is an amazing structure specially if you consider that they were built such a long time ago.",
          "Nice place to visit. Great examples of Inca buildings. Wear walking shoes as it is a bit of a climb. But not to hard. My biggest tip - ladies (and men) take toilet paper with you everywhere in Peru. Many site don't have paper. An airport ziplock bag with 1/4 a unwound role",
          "We visited the Moray Terraces as part of a tour group. Our guide, JJ, was very informative and explained in detail about the use of the terraces. It was so wonderful to see the agricultural advances made by the Incan in such a scientific manner. Wonderful.",
          "The views are amazing and you will get to see a piece of Inca engineering at its finest! There are local guides that can take you around the area and explain all of its history. I would recommend taking a guide or else you might just see lots of circles. Be wary that the",
          "Moray is so beautiful and peaceful. High up in the mountains, facing the glaciers in the distance, the terraces at Moray are so sacred and special. There are three obvious places to see with terraces, similar but uniquely different. Lie on the grass and feel the special energy",
          "The agricultural terraces of Moray are mind blowing. Whether you go with a tour, or not, I recommend having a guide. We learned an incredible amount from our guide! Like Salineras, I recommend being able to take your time here: walk all the way around, sit on the various",
          "These terraces are different from all the other ones you will see since it was here that the Incas did their genetical engineering. The conditions from the lower terraces and the upper terraces differ in such a way that the ancient Incas could select their crops to meet their",
          "This laboratory for the Incans is absolutely beautiful. From the views of the circular terraces to the floating steps, this place is gorgeous. What great evidence of the brilliance of the Incan culture!",
          "To go to Moray first we took a van to the first \"ramal\" of the way up to Ollantaytambo. Then we took a taxi to maras, 2 soles (1 for each). In Maras we bought tuna, bread and used the bath, Maras is a tiny town that has no more of that. Ask for the market, there is free",
          "As part of a day around the sacred valley, this place is definitely worth seeing. Also read a guide to understand why this site has been constructed like that, pretty interesting. This site is part of the pass of s/130. The suggestion is to get a taxi for a private tour: we",
          "The reason for the different levels is very interesting. It is amazing that the civilizations were as (or more) advanced as the architecture and designs prove.",

          "This is a wonderfully preserved/restored oasis of terraces. Quite a unique find, not far from the ruins of the area.",
          "We visited Moray on our way to our hotel in the Sacred Valley after leaving the Cusco airport. We did not use a guide but I had printed some information before we left, so that we could have an idea of the significance of the sight. What I found most surprising is how",
          "Viewed on a bus tour. Hiking to the bottom with the group. Once down there we felt a peacefulness and quietness come over us. Amazing. Did not think much about it at first but, it was unique.",
          "I have wanted to see this place since I was in my twenties. I finally made it, and it does not disappoint. Four magnificent holes in the ground, amazingly constructed.",
          "The ruins are beautiful and definitely worth the visit. I went with a tour group and we had a guided portion and free time. It will take you about 20 minutes to walk around the circles. Ask a guide to point out the phallus symbol to you - a lot of people didn't get that from",
          "We visited Moray as part of a Moray Moras tour froth Cusco. The entrance fee, which is not included in the tour price of most operators is however included on the Boleto Touristico de Cusco. We booked with Liz's Explorer and the tour cost 30 Bolivianos each. Very interesting",
          "Curious example of the development of the inca civilization, Moray probably was a kind of laboratory to experimental agriculture. They used to build terraces inside the valleys to test different kinds of corn, potatoes and other local products.",
          "How did the Incas build so many fantastic structures in such a short time? This amphitheater is yet another testimony to their engineering skills and desire to create beautiful structures.",
          "This is kind of out of the way but it is very interesting to see, so worth the trip. That said, be prepared - the roads there are poor and there's no amenities on site.",
          "You can get here either with a tour guide or just explore the place wherever. I think it is the best if you have a guide where can tell you great stories about Inka.",
          "This is the place where you can admire the skills of inka people! The terraces are very elegant and yet huge. Do not miss this place if you have plan to visit cusco!",
          "This is the place where Inka people put plants and domesticated them. 3000 different types of potatoes were made by inka and Moray system! Incredible! Moderate amount of hiking is required. Entrance fee will be covered by tourist ticket.",
          "This is an extremely interesting (and very picturesque) Inca site in the Sacred Valley. Hard ti tell from the pictures but it is the depth of a 50 story building. It seems the incas used it to domesticate wild plants and to systematically acclimate plants to various altitudes,",
          "The story and ongoing research and restoration here is fascinating - I recommend reading up in advance or hiring a good guide to give you some back story.",
          "This was an interesting stop during our time in Peru. It is very impressive to see how the Inca empire were as technological advances as the Romans in Europe. I wish there were more activities in the site maybe more information around the site. Definitively worth the visit if",
          "Worth a look. Supposedly an ancient agricultural lab. Quite remarkable. You'll need around an hour to do this site.",
          "No way, made by the Inca's and very ingenious. And huge! Made for agricultural purposes. If you drive up there you would miss them if there were no signs coz they are kind of dug into the ground. That's how it looks. You can walk all the way around at the top. Look good for the",
          "Worth a visit - they seemed much bigger than what was described in travel guides. We found the hike around the perimeter very relaxing, especially being able to go down into some of the surrounding, smaller terraces, experiencing the incredible change in levels between terraces.",
          "This Inca site is a little off the beaten path but worth the trek. We can only speculate on why these terraces were built in a circle but the notion that they were used for agricultural experimentation is interesting. There is not a whole lot to do at this site. Look and wonder.",
          "Moray circles are very interesting, visit them if you are around the Urubamba Valley, if you are in Cuzco you can also can go, just take a taxi,( around 50 soles, 15 dollars,one way, maybe more if they have to wait and come back to Cuzco.) Maybe it will take 1 or 1 1/2 hours to",
          "These ruins are somewhat off the beaten path however for 30 soles we were able to take a taxi roundtrip to Maras and see both the Rings and the salt mines. The views are gorgeous and truly like nothing you'll see anywhere else. Worth taking the afternoon to go to by taxi - a",
          "To see this wonderful terraces made by men to worship the Mother Nature & Earth who feeds them is a remarkable experience. At a plateau 11,500ft above Sea, these terraces are constant reminder of Inca period.",
          "This place is so cool!!! This Inca terracing is unbelievable. We enjoyed walking around and imagining the Inca people working here, probably experimenting with crops with the 5 degree difference in terraces. Wow!",
          "About 50km northwest of Cusco is the small village of Maras where the remains of the deep, circular terraces called the Moray Agricultural Terraces can be seen and walked. While there appears to be no absolute confirmation of what it was really constructed for, many",
          "This place is really beautiful. Truly unlike anything else I've ever seen. The terracing is fascinating. There is a path that you can take to walk around several of the pans. There is no need to take a formal tour (unless you need to get a ride here). Don't miss it!",
          "A really neat half day tour to take to Maras salt mines and Moray agricultural terraces! We happened to choose to do the half day ATV tour to these two locations. We were lucky enough to have a beautiful sunny day that day. Of course driving the ATV's was a lot of fun but the",
          "This was an extremely interesting historic site. The fact that it was made so many of hundreds of years ago is amazing. All of the circles are very similar although one is in much better repair. Would recommend coming here. Rating: 77/100",
          "We got a taxi in Ollantaytambo to take us to Moray and Salineras and it is definitely worth the trip. You can walk down and around the terraces, but not down them which was a bit of a disappointment, but like with most of the Incan ruins its a head scratcher trying to figure out",
          "Astounding stepped Incan ruins. Worth the drive...btw a lovely drive to get there through lovely scenery. Saw local kids coming from school. So interesting to my 11 year old...he love seeing this circular way of farming and wandering up and down. Magical location.",
          "The ruins are sorrouded by beautiful farm lands, it is a 25 minutes ride from Urubamba. You have to pass Maras Town before you arrive. The place is unbelieveble!! It is like a huge volcano crater size, when you are there you realize the size and the deep. There are a main",
          "At first I was not sure what to expect as we drove to the see this circular way of farming from the ancient Inca tribe, But once we arrived there, it was very interested to see how the Inca planted crops in concentric circles, and telling the different season, and what crops",
          "We visited with a small group and excellent guide. It is worth purchasing the local pass, which can be purchased at the first big attraction you visit. The local native guide helped us understand the microclimates of the terraces and what some of the forms could have",
          "We saw many terraces on our visit to the Cusco area and while some were curved, these were the only completely circular terraces that we saw. Not only were the terraces different but we took a nice walk here and went completely around the main sets of terraces to the back where",
          "At first sight, these terraces might seem to be simple. But when you think about their purpose - to simulate different agricultural microclimates on each of the terrace levels to study effects on crops - it becomes most amazing to consider the sophistication of Incan",
          "Alright so after Machu Picchu if you are left wondering what else these Inca guys built that was awesome! This is the place to go! Moray terraces are an amazing example of agricultural engineering, these guys were doing GMO's a long time ago and guess what, it worked perfectly.",
          "The Incas made their kingdom in the andean range, which means they had any kind of food and products from the sea to the 15 feet above sea level. The Andes are the water factory for the amazon river and it seems the Incas would never need anything for water conservancy or",
          "We saw this as part of a mountain bike tour - you haven't lived until you bike at over 11,000 feet! Our guide told us the Incas developed thousands of varieties of potatoes by growing them on different terraces in these pits - the temperature was different on each terrace! Their",
          "We had half a day so we went to see the terraces and were made to buy tickets for two days of adventure in Cusco area by the rude lady at ticket counter which were wasted as we were moving out of Cusco area.",
          "We had our Condor guide and driver The way these were built in really amazing The terraces were sort of an agricultural laboratory Worth to have the guide",
          "This is a must see in sacred valley! In my opinion, it is up there with MP. The size of these terraces is unbelievable, you must descend into it and climb out.",
          "This is a must. You can visit the Moray terraces and stroll around the three main complexes. A hat is most useful since the area is very sunny. You will go down the stairs and would need to go up but the area is not steep.",
          "A remarkable sight to visit while in Peru. The Incan's were able to manipulate the land around them in ingenious ways resulting in high crop diversity and yield. This sight displays said ingenuity. Check this place out",
          "We travelled here up a spectacular road from Ollantaytambo with some great sites. The actual terraces are in wonderful shape.",
          "This is probably the easiest archeological site to access in the Sacred Valley. The terraces are easily viewed just a few metres from the carpark. I liked them but would not travel a great distance to visit. If you are visiting the Maras Salt mines then probably worth the extra",
          "Really beautiful, but quite hard to get to. You can walk the site in less than an hour, so I would suggest also going to Salinas as that's close by and also doing Pisac which is close enough if you arrange a day tour or private driver. The facilities aren't very clean and there",
          "I mistook them for crop circles.These were used by Incan's to grow different variety of crops,mainly potatoes.Fascinating stories since I come from an society/family which has been involved in agriculture/cultivation for centuries.",
          "The Moray site was beautiful and very interesting. Moray is the name of the Incan ruins near the town of Maras, Peru that is found in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. Moray is an Incan agricultural laboratory that was likely used to cultivate resistant and hearty varieties of",
          "I think we were all stunned to hear the story behind these ruins and what an amazing story it is, the building of the terraces allows the wind to enter at different levels and therefore different temperatures and humidity levels, which allowed the Incas to grow corn and other",
          "Take a tour from Cusco around the Sacred Valley and head to Moray first to avoid the crowds. Fascinating site with well preserved terraces in this Incan agricultural laboratory. Takes 20-30 minutes to walk around the site, entrance included on the 10 day Boleto Turistico General",
          "Getting here is a bit difficult since there are no public buses (takin a taxi is costly too, S100-120 from Urubamba). But it's worth it. The view over the terraces is gorgeous and walking around the place is easy and provides you, on a clear day, also with good views of the",
          "We had an excellent guide for this site, Juan Gonzales. He helped us understand the purpose of this site which was actually and \"experimental farm\" related to altitude and climate. The Incas truly were an ingenious people and farmers.",
          "I find the round terraces here very picturesque, and the idea that it may have been an agricultural research centre is very cool. It's worth doing a loop of Moray, the nearby Salinas salt pans, and the town of Maras before going into the Sacred Valley.",
          "I liked Moray but I was staying in Urubamba and it is very easy to get to from there. Making a special trip just for Moray from Cusco would probably be disappointing. If going to Ollantaytambo it is possible to go here first as it is on the way. Moray has no building ruins and",
          "Very interesting place highlighting the ingenuity of the Incan to develop terraces with different temperatures and water content, allowing them to grow different crops adjacent to each other. Definitely worth a day trip including the nearby salt fields",
          "These are different from other terraces that you will see at Inca sites. The shape is very interesting and makes you think what the purpose of the design was. Sadly, you do not get to walk down into the circles. But, I guess that makes for better photos for everyone! You can",
          "This is a must if you are planning a trip to the Sacred Valley. the Incas were a fascinating culture and very advanced for their time. It's really interesting to learn how they developed their agriculture, and how that has shaped the way people live in Peru to this day.",
          "If you are spending any time in the sacred valley, you have to visit Moray. It's such an amazing site. There are actually 3 different crop experimentation circles, of varying sizes, all next to each other. Definitely take the time to walk all the way round and then down to",
          "Moray was an absolutely fascinating site -- very different than many of the other ruins that we visited since it was not a village, but rather an agricultural site. The circular terraces are stunningly beautiful and the science behind their creation just as interesting. We'd",
          "Moray is not only a great place from the sightseeing point of view, it's also fascinating since it was built as a research center!! The Incas did ground testing for plants, cereals and potatoes. I highly recommend to go with a good guide so he/she can explain it to you in",
          "The tour of Moray is often combined with the Salinares de Maras tour (salt pools). Our private tour guide and driver drove us here. The agricultural terraces were apparently an Inca research lab of sorts where they would experiment growing different plants and vegetables.",
          "Its the latter and its stunning. Out in the middle of nowhere at least an hour from Cusco, this was where the Inca's experimented with agricultural products from around the the empire. A fascinating place and you cam walk right down into it. Also has great views of the snow",
          "Our guide took us here and explained a bit about incanomy and how they did experiments with agricultures growing them on different terraces, each had different humidity and temperature, very interesting. In august people (local brujas) are doing healing ceremonies for local kids",
          "While in the sacred valley (if you have an extra day) be sure and visit the terrace agricultural site of Moray and the adjacent salt mines. My fianc\u00e9 and I spent the night in Yucay and did a 3&1/2 hour tour of both that cost $50 U.S. Morey was the second most important Incan",
          "After leaving Pisac the next stop was the Moray agricultural terraces. Our guide explained how the Incas experimented with different growing methods to improve their crops. It looked like the terraces had some degree of restoration. However, the farthest right terrace looked",
          "Although Macchu Picchu is the best know historic site in Peru, Moray atmosphere is very pleasant. When you gaze the terraces you feel like you were in another dimension. As it is not a very famous site there is always few people around there which makes this place a perfect",
          "The only way to get there is by car or tour bus. We didn't join a day tour. Instead we asked the driver who we hired to take us from ollantaytambo to cusco to stop by this Incan site plus Salinas salt mine with a little extra cost. It was all worth it.",
          "The Moray terraces have become an attraction in the last ten years. They again tell the history of the Inca's and how they learned and experimented in order to grow crops at the elevations in the Andes.",
          "The Moray circular terraces site is akin to an ancient experimental agricultural laboratory. Here the Incas tested various microclimates and their affects on plantings. We traveled from Ollantaytambo to Moray by driving up the mountain via switchbacks for over 1/2 hour. Snow",
          "Easy to find near Maras if driving yourselves or very cheap to hire cars and driver from Ollantaytambo for a half day here and the salt pans and Chinchero. Larger than you might expect, there are people in my first attached photo, and a large group in the second circle photo.",
          "Moray is the ancient Inca ruins that consist of enormous terraced, circular depressions with a sophisticated irrigation system. It is an archeological site located northwest of Cusco on a high plateau about 11,500 feet. It is close to Maras, so it\u2019s convenient to visit both",
          "We hired a private people carrier to take us to Moray. It was worth it as we had a combined ticket for 4 different places. The people carrier cost us 140 soles for 8 persons. The place was very fascinating and were told by the guide that each terrace varies by a few degrees of",
          "Brilliant display of ancient agricultural research and development. Well worth the visit. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes and take a warm jacket for in case the weather changes. Also don't just go to the main one - the other ones give the experience a whole new",
          "This is a great attraction to visit. It is absolutely amazing how the Inca mastered the high-altitude crop growing. The terraces are amazing and provide a spectacular view."

          "apparently the Vecunas are not seen frequently, however, we were lucky and several were on the hillside and further down. Here you can learn quite a bit about each creature. Piles of grass (?) were available to get their attention. Makes for great photo opportunities. All are",
          "Many Moons ago I visited this charming place on my Tour of Peru and the Amazon (Iquitos) and even though at the time I didn't entirely appreciate it I now look back on it with fondness. I remember it being a lovely sunny day but breezy, you got to feed the Llamas who were/are so",
          "We loved Awana Kancha, one of our first stops in the area upon arrival. Kids and adults loved feeding the llamas, alpacas and vicunas (but, be careful of occasional spitting by naughty animals! Daughter got spit in her eye - yuck!) We really enjoyed taking in the displays of",

          "We made a quick stop here on our way to the Sacred Valley. The Alpacas were sooooo cute! Stinky, but cute. We got to feed them which was fun. While not the most impressive as far a scenery, it was just too fun to not give it a great rating. The stop here made my day!",
          "When I first saw this on our itinerary I was worried that it was going to be a tourist trap. Instead I found a great educational experience about the weaving that is such a large part of the culture. The llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1as were irresistible. The weavings that were for sale",
          "First stop of a ten-day trip that included Machupicchu and Lake Titicaca, this museum/gift shop was unexpectedly breathtaking in its superb craftsmanship. I wish I had bought more than an small sample of their weaving. Stunning colors. If you see something that you like, buy",

          "After a long day of touring the Sacred Valley, we stopped here at sunset. In the girl\u2019s opinions, we saved the best for last. Highlights there included learning the differences between llamas and alpacas (llamas have longer ears and are roughly twice the size of alpacas),",

          "Our Nat Geo folks took us here on our way back from Machu Picchu. It was obstensibly to let us see the four camelids native to Peru. In addition to the llamas and alpacas we would see vicunas and guanacos. That was neat enough. You could feed the domesticated llamas and alpacas.",
          "I can't begin to tell you how much informations I've acquired from my visit here. The culture had never been so vividly expressed than it was expressed here in Awana Kancha. The llamas and alpacas were added fun of the tour. The vicunas were quite a snob ;) The whole community",
          "We stopped here on our second day on ten in Peru in 2009* and thoroughly enjoyed the educational aspects of the tour plus the beautiful work. We did not realize that it would be the best work we would see on our trip so made sure to take a taxi out of Cusco toward the end of",

          "We stopped here on our way to Urubamba on a National Geographic tour to Machu Picchu. It was interesting to see and feed the llamas and see the weavers but it really felt like they were pushing us into the shop where the items were very expensive. We were disappointed that this",
          "I enjoyed this very informative stop in the journey to Machu Picchu. I enjoyed feeding the lamas and was interesting to see many of the different breeds. They had a few shops to look through and some live demonstrations on how articles are made. I agree with others that the",

          "We really enjoyed this stop, learning about the variety of alpaca, getting to see and feed & pet them, then learning about the dying process, watching the ladies weave, and then the fabulous gift shop with a huge selection to buy! (not to mention really nice bathrooms!) You",
          "One of the best things we did on our trip. It was great fun feeding the Alpacas. It was really interesting watching the girls weave their cloth by hand. We were taken aback by all the natural ingredients used in the colours of the clothing. Although the gift shop is",
          "Lovely little farm where you can get up close to & feed the Alpaca and Llama and purchase high quality items. The people are not pushy, very friendly. There are demonstrations of handy crafts that are for sale. We fed the animals and purchased beautiful alpaca socks for less",
          "We made a quick stop here on our way to the Sacred Valley. The Alpacas were sooooo cute! Stinky, but cute. We got to feed them which was fun. While not the most impressive as far a scenery, it was just too fun to not give it a great rating. The stop here made my day!",
          "When I first saw this on our itinerary I was worried that it was going to be a tourist trap. Instead I found a great educational experience about the weaving that is such a large part of the culture. The llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1as were irresistible. The weavings that were for sale",
          "First stop of a ten-day trip that included Machupicchu and Lake Titicaca, this museum/gift shop was unexpectedly breathtaking in its superb craftsmanship. I wish I had bought more than an small sample of their weaving. Stunning colors. If you see something that you like, buy",
          "Well this is my second most special thing I did in the sacred valley so far. Up close and personal with the condors, pumas and a large variety of eagles and kites, macaws and monkeys. All rescued. for 10 soles entry it was well worth 5 times that. really enjoyed my time here",
          "We love to bring traditional, high quality textiles home from our trips and this was one of the Andean weaving communities that we visited upon recommendation from our guide. Upon entering there are llamas and alpacas that you can view and feed. It is quite educational to learn",
          "I visited this museum coming into the sacred valley with a private tour guide. He told me the alpacas, llamas - and even vicu\u00f1a, which can't be herded, are all very well cared for here and that they are promoting the teaching of traditional weaving skills that otherwise might be",
          "After a long day of touring the Sacred Valley, we stopped here at sunset. In the girl\u2019s opinions, we saved the best for last. Highlights there included learning the differences between llamas and alpacas (llamas have longer ears and are roughly twice the size of alpacas),",
          "This is a fun place to lean all about different kinds of lama and Vicugna. You can feed and pet the animals. Kids love this place.",
          "Get up close and see/learn the differences between alpaca's, llama's and vicuna's...and the different types of each! A great photo experience for animal lovers. Weaving demonstrations and textile/cultural exhibitions...very informative & interesting. The shop sells the 'real",
          "You can get up close and personal with a variety of Peruvian camelids here. There are plenty of different llamas and what-have-you, all eager to eat from your hands. Kids will have a blast here. You can also learn about how they make and dye yarn. Everyone here was friendly,",
          "We were able to see llamas and alpacas and learn about their migration to the Americas. By migration I mean Europeans taking them here but their origins lie in the Middle East. This is a quick stop you can feed and take pictures with the animals as well.",
          "We love animals so this was high on our list of things to do. It's a lot of fun. You can feed the llamas, alpacas and other animals. Plus, take fun pictures. There are also women in colorful outfits demonstrating their work. We bought a nice Christmas ornament in the gift shop.",
          "We visited after suggestion from our taxi driver and am so glad we did. We walked through the museum and learned a lot more about the culture, practices and functions that alpacas, llamas and other animals have in this region. Our guide was very patient with us as we kind of",
          "This is somewhat like a petting zoo. The park has Llamas, Guanaco, Vicu\u00f1a, and Alpaca which you can feed and pet if the animals let you. There's lots of animal information, plus costumed locals demonstrating weaving and other traditional life. There's also a shop and restrooms",
          "One can see the various types of camilids an see the rare vicuna in the diatance. There are various feedstations along the way where one can feed the animals. At the end there is a shop where one can buy good quality baby alpaca throws and shaws. the prices are about 10% higher",
          "This was recommended to us by our hotel front office staff while booking a day Taxi to the sacred valley.. I did not know what to expect and was pleased! The museum was concise and informative. We loved the opportunity to visit with the animals for petting and feeding",
          "Awana Kancha is an under visit Llana family display farm about half way between Cusco and Pisac. You can get to either city via taxi for about 35 to 40 sole. Learn the difference between Llama, Guanaco, Vicu\u00f1a, and Alpaca. Camels originated in North American about 2.5",
          "We visited this after the Ccochahuasi Animal Sanctuary and thus had already had our llama fix. This is a more commercial operation as compared to the Animal Sanctuary. Good facilities and museum.",
          "My wife and I were on a group tour with Globus and this was one of the sight-seeing stops. We learned about the animals - specifically Camelidos of Peru - Alpaca (Love the Suri version!), llama, vicuna, we were given alfalfa to feed the various animals; not that it's bad, but",

          "I can't begin to tell you how much informations I've acquired from my visit here. The culture had never been so vividly expressed than it was expressed here in Awana Kancha. The llamas and alpacas were added fun of the tour. The vicunas were quite a snob ;) The whole community",

        "wiki": "Cusco, often spelled Cuzco [\u02c8kusko] (Quechua: Qusqu, [\u02c8q\u0254sq\u0254]), is a city in southeastern Peru, on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. The city is the seventh most populous in Peru, and in 2017 it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft).\nThe city was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th century until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983, Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru (1993) designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.Since 1976, the preferred local spelling of the city has been Cusco, to reflect current pronunciation in Spanish and Quechua; since 1990 local authorities adopted Qosqo as the spelling, to be more closely aligned with the Quechua language. \n\n\n== Spelling and etymology ==\nThe indigenous name of this city is Qusqu. Although the name was used in Southern Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase qusqu wanka ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (Ayar Auca) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ayllu (\"lineage\"):\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at Guanacaure as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named Manco Capac.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named Pacaritambo, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as Cuzco or, less often, Cozco. Cuzco was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough Cusco was also used. Cuzco, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.As both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, Cusco, in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechua: Qosqo.\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found.  The Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam-Webster Dictionary prefer \"Cuzco\", and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Killke culture ===\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square metres) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\n=== Inca history ===\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century \u2013 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the urin and hanan. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tawantinsuyu. Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\nThe city fell to the sphere of Hu\u00e1scar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1528. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see Battle of Cuzco), and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\n\n=== After the Spanish invasion ===\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.Pizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos, or land grants to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He supported construction of the Dominican Order monastery (Santo Domingo Convent)on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.During the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca, he took control of the city back from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State. There he survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former Inca Empire) was built on Killke structures. The Spanish replaced indigenous temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and archdiocese.\n\n\n=== Present ===\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive Qurikancha (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the Qurikancha were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada P\u00e9rez, a staunch supporter of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name Qosqo was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nIn 1933, the Congress of Americanists met in La Plata, Argentina, and declared the city as the Archeological Capital of the Americas.\nIn 1978, the 7th Convention of Mayors of Great World Cities met in Milan, Italy, and declared Cusco a Cultural Heritage of the World.\nIn 1983, UNESCO, in Paris, France, declared the city a World Heritage Site. The Peruvian government declared it the Tourism Capital of Peru and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.\nIn 2007, the New7Wonders Foundation designated Machu Picchu one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, following a worldwide poll.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with 4,000\u20136,000-metre-high (13,000\u201320,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay (6,271 metres or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometres (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.Cusco has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwb). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs between April to September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 \u00b0C (49.5 \u00b0F). Summer occurs between October and March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month which averages 13.3 \u00b0C (55.9 \u00b0F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 \u00b0C (32.4 to 69.6 \u00b0F), but the all-time temperature range is between \u22128.9 and 30 \u00b0C (16.0 and 86.0 \u00b0F). Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion.\n\n\n== Main sites ==\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuam\u00e1n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\n\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo.\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft); Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at \u00d1usta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tip\u00f3n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, Cienciano.\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\n\n=== Architectural heritage ===\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\n\n==== Barrio de San Blas ====\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is Tuq'ukachi, which means the opening of the salt.\n\n\n==== Hatun Rumiyuq ====\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\nAlong this street that runs from the Plaza de Armas to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\n\n==== Bas\u00edlica de la Merced ====\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\n\n==== Cathedral ====\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the Iglesia del Triunfo, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\n\n==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of T\u00fapac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compa\u00f1\u00eda both open directly onto the plaza.\n\n\n==== Iglesia de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas ====\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the Amarucancha or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts fa\u00e7ade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\n\n==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God \u2013 Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\nCusco has the following important museums:\nMuseo de Arte Precolombino\nCasa Concha Museum (Machu Picchu Museum)\nMuseo Inka\nMuseo Hist\u00f3rico Regional de Cuzco\nCentro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cuzco or Center of the Traditional Textiles of Cusco in English\nMuseum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants (Museo de plantas sagradas, m\u00e1gicas y medicinales)\nChocoMuseo (The Cacao and Chocolate Museum)There are also some museums located at churches.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nCusque\u00f1a brewery\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\n== In modern culture ==\nIn the film The Emperor's New Groove and its spin-off animated television series The Emperor's New School, the main protagonist is \"Kuzco\", the young, often immature fictional emperor of the Incas.\nIn the film \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Indiana travels to Cuzco in search of his friend Ox.\n\"Cuzco\" was the name of a song on E.S. Posthumus' 2001 album Unearthed. Each song on the album was named after an ancient city.\nThe Anthony Horowitz novel Evil Star takes place partly in Cusco.\nBBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel died in Cusco on a working holiday in 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGovernorate of New Castile\nInca religion in Cusco\nInca road system\nIperu, tourist information and assistance\nList of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country\nList of buildings and structures in Cusco\nPeruRail\nPikillaqta\nSanturantikuy\nTampukancha, Inca religious site\nTourism in Peru\nWanakawri\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cusco at Wikimedia Commons\n Cusco travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nCusco official website",

          "This was a short hike from the Palacio del Inka hotel where we stayed. The San Pedro Market is definitely a must-see if you speak Spanish and you can connect with locals here see how they shop and what they're shopping for they are very friendly and kind and try to help even if",
          "This is a interesting place to visit. Tons of shops, tour companies, and street vendors... And excellent historic buildings and cathedrals. There are a few in a small number of blocks. Prices get better the further you wander away from the main tourist area. Look for the",
          "This is a great place to relax and people watch. After the bustle and noise of Lima, Cusco feels peaceful and safe. The streets are narrow and the local people are friendly. The churches around the square are beautiful.",
          "Nice cobblestone streets and a bustling live place that\u2019s fun to people watch but my experience was tampered by the knowledge that the buildings were built by destroying the historical Incan capital and reusing their raw material.",
          "I saw many women walking by themselves with their phones in their hands and purses on their arms without a worry including in the dark. There was security in every direction at every corner ready to help answer any question. The city is easily visited by walking. I only used",
          "Cusco is much more than the gateway to Machu Picchu. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and part of the reason is just a short walk from the JW Marriott and other quality lodging in the central part of town. Cusco\u2019s main square, the bustling Plaza de Armas, is home",
          "Beautiful city, surround by historic places, narrow streets by San Blas. It is a relaxing experience to be there, very secure city.",
          "A good place to go for a walk. Several times a month they have procession with live music and dance. Many historical places and museums to visits.",
          "We toured this place with a good tour that you already mentioned, but I really wanted to write exclusively for this place, since I found it wonderful, we came from modern cities, which were created by civilized man, colonizing civilizations, but that were mounted where there was",
          "Good place to visit for a day - the architecture and museums were great. There are 2 good veg/vegan restaurants in the area, otherwise take your shopping to the more rural regions as the prices were 3 to 4 times higher (for the same products) than outside of Cuzco.",
          "This plaza is wonderful! We saw a huge military parade and witness the national pride of the locals. There were other parades on different days and lots of people, I felt very safe!",
          "Cuscos main square is a lively and vibrant area marking the center of the city of Cusco. The Plaza features wide stone walkways and pretty gardens. It is flanked by two impressive buildings, Cusco Cathedral and the Church La Compania de Jesus. Many of the Inca carved walls",
          "The historical center of Cusco is very pleasant. Not much shade but plenty of places to take a quick break and rest if you are suffering from altitude sickness. The churches that surround the main plaza are truly beautiful.",
          "Plaza de Armas is a wonderful place to see the history of the city. It is surrounded by cathedrals, restaurants and shops. People usually just sit and hang out in the evening sin the park at the plaza. Very safe area. Highly recommended.",
          "Buildings showing both pre-inca and Incan stonework with the catholic cathedrals. The local markets and how they have blended their own heritage with the Spanish influence is amazing. Strolling around just looking at buildings is Wirth an hour of anyone's time.",
          "Well, maybe not. Like too many visitors to Peru, you came for Machu Picchu and Cusco is only a filler in order for you to acclimate to the altitude. That would be a shame because Cusco is a fantastic place to visit and the history starts right here in the old city center. I",
          "I was on a trip with students to Peru. Jhonnatan Flores Aucca with Dircetur was our guide for a waliking tour in Cusco and also seeing sights in the Sacred Valley (Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Chinchero). Jhonnatan's knowledge of the area was exemplary and his enthusiasm made the tours",
          "We found Cusco an amazing town to wander around and explore. Some of the restaurants over looking to square are nice with a great view. But a little touristy priced.",
          "Definitely above the expectations! The Plaza de Armas is beautiful expecially at night with al the lights of the hills surrounding. Highly recommended a visit. I would use Cusco as a base for visiting the rainbow mountain, the valle sagrado and the cusco city center.",
          "Cusco is the gateway to Michu Picchu but by itself it\u2019s a great place. Of course you get hassled by street sellers but you just politely refuse. The main square is a delight with restaurants and churches along with shops and sight to see. Market is close by and worth the",
          "Loved finding a bench to rest and take in the area. Watching the other visitors and locals was a favorite.",
          "Cusco\u2019s historic center was amazing! Loved the people. Everything is centric and very safe! The fold is amazing and the people are very friendly and they help you get around. This is also a good place to get last minute tours at a very good price.",
          "Super lively early in the morning (7am) and even late into the night (10pm). Loved just walking around the plaza and soaking in everyday life. Plenty of window shopping to be done and people watching as well.",
          "A great place to sit, people watch, photograph, sketch, eat... a must visit when in Cusco. The afternoons are particularly active.",
          "You can while away all your time here. This is one of the prettiest square we have been to. You can people watch, wonder at the mountains, dine, drink or get a massage.",
          "Beautiful and magical place, recommended to visit the Cathedral church, the chocolate museum and the chicha restaurant by Gaston.",
          "While we stayed in Cusco we were lucky enough to have this on our doorstep and it was a stunning view every morning, afternoon or evening. Although mornings were cold by around 10am you would feel the heat again and it came down strong once it did. There always seemed to be",
          "Same as all the other cities in Peru. This is where everyone gathers. Municipal buildings on one side and church/cathedral on the other with retail outlets. Lots of people selling walking tours or day trips. Just sit enjoy and watch the (very busy) world go by.",
          "Wander, shop, have a drink, eat some food, people watch, and just enjoy the beautiful city of Cusco!",
          "Nice restaurants and bars around city center , nice ppl and safe , I would say the perfect place to chill after a trip :)",
          "We enjoyed a pisco sour in one of the restaurants of this main square. The view from the balcony was great! A nice time to enjoyed this Peruvian drink in a relaxing way.",
          "We were coming from Lima, that is definitely a cloudy, awful, crowded, big town, and we became really fashinated by the sunny city of Cusco. Castled between the high mountain, closed to the sacred valley, very safe place to walk alone, you can enjoy what you prefer.",
          "Nice but busy city with a mixture of Inca and Spanish architecture. Hub to Machu Picchu. Central plaza and small streets around plaza are worth visiting. One day is enough. The underground museum with inca remains (5 little rooms) is worthwile to visit.",
          "I really like architecture because all the Center of the City has a mixture of Inkan and Spanish architecture. Cusco is a different city, one that I must come back to.",
          "There is plenty to do and see within easy walking distance of Cusco's Historical Center. Several historical sites, museums and churches. Plenty of places to pick up souvenirs. Make sure to take it easy the first day or two as you are at over 11k feet of altitude and you will",
          "I was extremely impressed by the downtown area of Cusco. It's definitely worth spending a couple of days there, as it's very nice to just walk around. The only thing that disappointed me is that many of the narrow roads were still open to traffic. I believe it would be a lot",
          "I spent 3 weeks in, and near, Cusco recently. I was traveling alone and felt totally safe in this beautiful old town which was so amazingly clean even during Inti Rayma (when thousands of visitors arrive) Such history to explore! And such beauty.",
          "Trip to Cusco is not complete until we spend sometime in Centro historico it is preserved with all old world charm coupled with modern free WiFi even",
          "What a gem! We had no idea Cusco, Peru would be so charming. There is a lot to do and see. Nice people. Paddy's Irish Pub was a blast and great food.",
          "a very beautiful place, from where you can choose to go to lunch or go for a cup of coffee or go dancing.",
          "You are able to make a great city tour, because the old colonial city is that, you could see the treasures around and the guides will explain with a lot of knowledge about the locations that you visit",
          "This central square was a great place to stop and catch your breath and do some people watching. We were lucky enough to stumble onto a dance recital and Peru's Independence Day parade. Both were fun to watch and gave great insight into the local pride",
          "While visiting this area today, I discovered that the Spanish are proud of their involvement in South America. I stood in front of the statue to the Inca Emperor Atahualpa as I heard this and could not believe my ears. The Spanish need to know that their representative Pizarro",
          "We stayed downtown so this was an easy walk from our hotel. Very cosmopolitan and safe city. There were people out and about until late at night. Interesting sights and churches to visit.",
          "I stayed in a hotel near here and visited every day--there was always something happening, from tourists and tour groups to festivals, dancing and marching. Watch the uphill street next to the Cathedral, local vendors and women with alpacas gather there and you can sit an",

          "The are is surround by old and beautiful buildings, a lot of places to eat and bars to drink in, the areas is safe, a lot of tourist around to mingle in with, this is a must see place and if staying in Cuzco you will probably end up and around this area.",
          "Spiritual center of the Incas. You ca easily spot where the colonials used the stones from Inca capital to build their churches and cathedrals. Some of the stones reflect the sad story of the colonial era but some religious buildings astonish you how beautiful the architecture",
          "Our visit was made much more intriguing by a fiesta with dancing in different costumes celebrating a saints day",
          "My spouse and I visited Cuzco Peru during our first cruise to South America with Seabourn and did not regret. Cuzco architecture is so different from what we are used to in Europe. The density of houses is amazing. The earthquake must have devastating.",
          "This place was very close to where we were staying on our Cusco visit and we did visit it several times during the day and at night. The place look very glamorous at night. There are several shops, churches, markets, vendors, tour companies, restaurants etc all around the place.",
          "Knowing this city was for me and my family, something really incredible, we traveled not only the region of Cusco, we also met Lima, we hired a very good company, which we will recommend in another review, how we had a great time, we could not believe So much culture is there in",
          "While a major tourist site, I never felt overwhelmed by the number of tourists. The space was big enough and the views stunning enough that the people faded into the background. The side streets were charming and having acclimatised to the height, well worth strolling around",
          "Cusco was over looked in our planning to hike the Inca trail. We planed on several days simply to acclimate before our 4 day hike to Machu Picchu. We would have planned to spend more time in Cusco. It has it all - even walking down the cobble stone streets was fun. It had",

          "A great place to get the heartbeat of the city, hang out with locals and out-of-towners alike. The balcony restaurants are a bit of a tourist trap, but great places nonetheless.",
          "Beautiful area in the heart of Cusco with amazing old world charm, but tons of new world energy at night. Lots of delicious restaurants and shops nearby then at night for adults great mix of bars, clubs, and dance halls (many are gay and gay-friendly!) so you can drink and",

          "The Historical Centre of Cusco is such an incredible place to be. Yes, you get all the venders trying to sell everything from sunglasses to massages to every tourist that walks by, but behind that, just past the Plaza de Armas, there's so much life in the city! If you can climb",

          "We were in and out of Cusco for several days and absolutely loved this plaza! It's a great place to walk, shop and people-watch. Vendors will try to sell you their goods, but just say no gracias and move on. We were told to be aware of pickpockets, but didn't have any problems",
          "We acclimatized during the Winter Solstice celebration so it was a really amazing cultural celebration and great way to learn about Incan culture. I would've given 5 stars, but my boyfriend was pick pocketed within the first hour of arriving. I'm sure it's worse during big",

        "wiki": "The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu (also known as Camino Inca or Camino Inka) is a hiking trail in Peru that terminates at Machu Picchu. It consists of three overlapping trails: Mollepata, Classic, and One Day. Mollepata is the longest of the three routes with the highest mountain pass and intersects with the Classic route before crossing Warmiwa\u00f1usqa (\"dead woman\"). Located in the Andes mountain range, the trail passes through several types of Andean environments including cloud forest and alpine tundra. Settlements, tunnels, and many Incan ruins are located along the trail before ending the terminus at the Sun Gate on Machu Picchu mountain. The two longer routes require an ascent to beyond 4,200 metres (13,800 ft) above sea level, which can result in altitude sickness.\nConcern about overuse leading to erosion has led the Peruvian government to place a limit on the number of people who may hike this trail per season, and to sharply limit the companies that can provide guides. As a result, advance booking is mandatory. A maximum of 500 people are allowed on the trail each day, of which only 200 are trekkers, the rest being guides and porters. As a result, the high season books out very quickly.\nThe trail is closed every February for cleaning. This was originally done informally by organizations such as South American Explorers, but is now managed officially.\n\n\n== Classic trail ==\n\nTrekkers normally take four or five days to complete the \"Classic Inca Trail\" but a two-day trek from Km 104 is also possible.It starts from one of two points: 88 km (55 miles) or 82 km (51 miles) from Cusco on the Urubamba River at approximately 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) or 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) elevation, respectively.Both of these trail segments meet above the Inca ruins of Patallaqta (sometimes called Llaqtapata), a site used for religious and ceremonial functions, crop production, and housing for soldiers from the nearby hilltop site of Willkaraqay, an ancient pre-Inca site first inhabited around 500 BC.\nThe trail undulates, but overall ascends along the Kusichaka River.\nAt the small village Wayllapampa (\"grassy plain\", Wayllabamba) the trail intersects with the \"Mollepata Trail\" at 3,000 metres (9,800 ft).Small, permanent settlements are located adjacent to the trail, and Wayllapampa has approximately 400 inhabitants (130 families) spread along this portion of the trail. Pack animals\u2014horses, mules, donkeys, and llamas\u2014are allowed.\nAt Wayllapampa the trail to Machu Picchu turns west and begins ascending along a tributary of the Kusichaka. Because of previous damage caused by hooves, pack animals are not allowed on the remainder of the trail. For the same reason, metal-tipped trekking poles are not allowed on the trail.\n\nAs the trail ascends toward Warmi Wa\u00f1usqa, or \"Dead Woman's Pass\", which resembles a supine woman, it passes through differing habitats, one of which is a cloud forest containing Polylepis trees. The campsite at Llulluch'apampa (Llulluchapampa) is located on this stretch of trail at 3,800 metres (12,500 ft). The pass itself is located at 4,215 m (13,829 ft) above sea level, and is the highest point on this, the \"Classic\" trail.\nAfter crossing the pass the trail drops steeply into the Pakaymayu drainage. At a distance of 2.1 km and 600 m below the pass is the campground Pakaymayu.\n\nAfter passing Pakaymayu the trail begins steeply ascending the other side of the valley. One kilometre along the trail, at an elevation of 3,750 metres (12,300 ft) is the Inca tampu Runkuraqay, ruins which overlook the valley. The site was heavily restored in the late 1990s.The trail continues to ascend, passing a small lake named Quchapata (Cochapata) in an area that is recognized as deer habitat. This site had been used as a camp site. As with other sites that were being degraded due to overuse, camping is no longer allowed. The trail reaches the pass at an elevation of 3950 m.\nThe trail continues through high cloud forest, undulating, sometimes steeply while affording increasingly dramatic viewpoints of mountains and dropoffs. Next, the Sayaqmarka (\"steep-place town\") is reached followed by the tampu Qunchamarka. A long Inca tunnel and a viewpoint overlooking two valleys: the Urubamba and Aobamba (a broken word), are passed.\n\n\t\t\n\nAnother high point at elevation of 3650 m is crossed, followed by a campground, and then after a short descent, a site with extensive ruins. The name Phuyupatamarka (\"cloud-level town\") (phoo-yoo-patta-marka) is applied to both the campground, and the ruins.Hiram Bingham III discovered the site, but left most of it covered with vegetation. The Fejos team named the site, and uncovered the remainder. Design of the site closely follows the natural contours, and includes five fountains and an altar, which was probably used for llama sacrifice.The trail then descends approximately 1000 metres including an irregular staircase of approximately 1500 steps, some of which were carved into solid granite. Vegetation becomes more dense, lush, and jungle-like with an accompanying increase in butterflies and birds. A second Inca tunnel is along this section of trail.\n \t\t\nEven before passing through the tunnel there are views down to the Willkanuta River, the first since leaving the river at Patallaqta. The number of these views increases. After the tunnel the town of Machupicchu (Aguas Calientes) can be seen, and trains running along the river can be heard. As the trail nears Intipata, it affords views of the \"Two Day\" Inca Trail (aka \"Camino Real de los Inkas\" or \"One Day Inca Trail\"). A small spur of the trail leads directly to Wi\u00f1ay Wayna, while the main route continues to Intipata. \t\t\nIntipata (aka Yunkapata) is a recently uncovered extensive set of agricultural terraces which follow the convex shape of the terrain. Potatoes, maize, fruit, and sweet potato were grown here.\t\t\n\nThe name Wi\u00f1ay Wayna (forever young) (win-yay-way-na) is used to refer to both a hostel\u2013restaurant\u2013camp site and a set of Inca ruins. Two groups of major architectural structures, a lower and upper, are set among multiple agricultural terraces at this concave mountainside site. A long flight of fountains or ritual baths utilizing as many as 19 springs runs between the two groups of buildings.From Wi\u00f1ay Wayna the trail undulates along below the crest of the east slope of the mountain named Machu Picchu. The steep stairs leading to Inti Punku (\"sun gate\") are reached after approximately 3 km. Reaching the crest of this ridge reveals the grandeur of the ruins of Machu Picchu, which lie below. A short downhill walk is the final section of the trail.\n\n\n== Inca Trail Permits ==\nBecause of its popularity, the Peruvian Government instituted several controls to reduce human impact upon the trail and within the ancient city. The most notable is a quota system, introduced in 2001, whereby only a set number of people (including hikers, porters, and guides) would be allowed to hike along the Inca Trail each day. This system is still in effect; any person wishing to hike the Inca Trail must obtain a permit beforehand. As of 2016, 500 permits are issued for each day. All of the year's permits are released in October and are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Permits were previously released in January, however, in 2017 this changed to October. Permits sell out quickly, particularly those for the high season. Most operators advise hikers to purchase permits as soon as possible after they are released. The government also mandated that every trekker on the trail must be accompanied by a guide. Because of this rule, permits can only be obtained through a government registered tour operator. All permits are paired with an individual passport and are not transferable. The government monitors the trail closely; there are several control points along the trail.\n\n\n== Inca Trail Elevation ==\n\nThe Inca Trail elevation varies significantly and people often struggle with altitude sickness, especially if they have not spent much time in Cusco before trekking the trail.\nCusco stands at 3,200 metres and is already significantly higher than Machu Picchu itself, though many sections of the Inca Trail are much higher.\nStarting at 2,600 metres, the trail ascends to 3,300 metres on the first day. The second day ascends over Dead Woman's pass- the highest point on the Inca Trail at 4,200 metres. This is the most dangerous point for altitude sickness, though little time is spent at this elevation and the trail descends again to 3,600 metres.\nThe trail only descends from this point until arriving at Machu Picchu at 2,430 metres.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLares trek, one of the alternative routes to Machu Picchu\nSalcantay trek\nTourism in Peru\nThe Chilean Inca Trail\nInca road system\nCapaq \u00d1an trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBox, Ben; Frankham, Steve (2008).

          "Llama Path is the company I used and they did a fantastic job. This is a tough hike so be pepaired. Go hike soon mountains and get into better shape. elevation is close to 14k feet up. Don\u2019t forget to stop and look at the views.",
          "We did the four day Inca Trail, our porters and guide were booked with Wayki they did a great job! The trail is different each day different challenges and always something interesting to see the scenery is incredible. Make sure you layer your clothing as the temperature varies",
          "What a fantastic 4 days hiking into Machu Picchu. Stunning views along a well worn path with ruins along the way. Setting out from Ollantaytambo in the heart of Inca territory, the walk is a steady and challenging one but one that stays in memories of Peru. Fabulous, so pleased",
          "One of the best trails to hike, sweeping vistas, Urubamba river, the Andes , the cool , crisp air, the panaromas. you'll fall in love with nature and yourself just because you are able to visit this place.",
          "My friend and I did the 2D/1N version as we aren\u2019t hikers nor campers... we were quite exhausted afterwards but it was well worth it. Get your altitude sickness prevention pills and work out in advance!",
          "You cannot describe this in a review. We had friends who did other tours and the scenery just didn't compare to the classic trail. It was clean and not very busy. You visit mini 'machu-picchus' on the way and every turn is breathtaking. Simply the best and most challenging thing",
          "What can I say, not to be missed, but really, really, hard. The altitude makes what should be an easy walk into a very difficult walk, particularly day 2. Make sure you train before you go, and be prepared for basic camping.",
          "This is an excellent trek with a reasonable degree difficulty. Weather can be a bit unpredictable. Follow the advice of your company for clothing suggestions and be prepared. Training beforehand will make the experience much more enjoyable.",
          "There are lots to see on this trek from Cusco to Machu Picchu. Be prepared for the gigantic changes in the elements, as you will experience cold temperatures on snowy mountains and tropical temperatures and weather in tropical rainforests. From the heights to the valleys,",
          "Bucket-list worthy experience! Did the 4-day hike over the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and then hiked up Huayna Picchu! Loved every minute!",
          "Amazing architecture along the trail. Inca ruins were intact and told an tale of strength and resolve.",
          "Challenging trek to get the most incredible view of Machu Picchu form the Sun Gate. Be in shape if you're going to do this. If you're not, take the train to Aguas Clients.",
          "My son and I completed the 4 day Inca trail May 12, 2018. There is no question that the Inca trail is the most amazing trail in the world. Do not be naive and think it is just another trail and will be easy to complete, without question this was the most difficult physical",
          "Exquisite views, vigorous hike (2 day hike of Inca trail), magnificent vistas. Well worth the effort!",
          "The inca trail was actually better than Machu Picchu. Would highly recommend using Llama Path for a guide service.",
          "This 4 day trek 3 night camp felt very rushed could have done with it spread over another day, too rushed to really appreciate the scenery, but an amazing adventure none the less",

          "Our family of four did the one day hike on the Inca Trail getting dropped off the train at mile marker 104 and hiking up and up to Machu Picchu. You start at the river (we took the early train at 7 am from Ollantaytambo) around 830 and cross the river to a ranger station to",
          "The Inka trail has been on our bucket list for a while and I am now glad to say that we have done it. We done the four day hike with Intrepid travel. We were well looked after every step of the way. From the minute we meet our guide and assistant guide we were fully informed",
          "Probably one of the greatest things I've done in my life! It was not easy but it was TOTALLY worth it! Don't forget to have plenty of water, protein bars and coca leaves with you and make sure you wear comfy clothes/ shoes because you will experience different climates and paths",
          "The Inca Trail is always highly rated as a hike and it totally lives up to the hype. You hike through four different microclimates and pass several Incan Ruins. It's truly an unforgettable trip.",
          "This is a fabulous trail to walk! We just undertook the day trail up to Machu Picchu. It was the hardest thing that I have ever done and I am a fit person but if you don't do it you will be disappointed. At the end viewing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate is a vista that will",
          "The sensation you have when you are in this trail is exhilarating, we learned so much from the local guides. The sensation of spiritual freedom at the top of the trial is mystifying.",
          "I did the 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. I think the words, or even pictures, fall short to describe the beauty of this place. Because of this, I will focus on the things that might help you to enjoy 100% this place. The trail: It has aprox. 43km in length. The longest",
          "I am not of the age anymore where I want to be sleeping out on the trail for the 4 day hike into Machu Picchu. But I highly recommend the one day hike from Km 104. Find a guide and go. It's a hard hike at elevation but the feeling of elation when hiking over the Sun Gate and",
          "We did the 2 day Inca trail hike. It was something I am thrilled to say I completed. It is not for the faint hearted. I had no idea how many steps I would be climbing. As a 50 something mom, I have to admit I needed help from my husband carrying my pack at times. We used",
          "Whew. It was Tough! My husband and I hiked it and it took eight hours from the trail head to Machu Picchu. We are in our mid fifties, so age and the altitude took its toll. However, we completed the hike and it was worth every ounce of pain and suffering to see Machu Picchu.",
          "Four days of jawdropping views going up and down and up and down the Andes, with the occasional \"Peruvian flat\" (less up and down) ... it's tough, Day 2 is a test, as is the first leg of Day 3. Was really rewarding arriving at Machu Picchu. Don't think about it. Do it. Just be",
          "We only did a small chunk but it was completely worth it. The chunk we did was from Machu Picchu to the dead end. The incredible views made us want to do more of the trail at some later point in life.",
          "I didn't have time for a full 4-day excursion, so my tour company arranged a one-day version starting from KM104, where we deboarded the train to begin. The views were amazing, the trail is not technically difficult, but pretty strenuous, even for someone kind of in shape.",
          "The experienced of a life time!! If your are considering hiking the Inca Trail, do it. Just be sure you properly train and prep your body for the altitude.",
          "Arriving into Machu Picchu is soooo much better when you arrive via the Inca Trail. Although it is challenging most people will be able to complete this. Dead Woman's pass is the most challenging part and once you are past that it is reasonably straightforward.",
          "We absolutely loved our time with local Salkantay Trekkers Peru - doing the 4D-3N classical Inca Trail with them. We felt this was an excellent company to choose to do the famous trek to Machupicchu with, and we liked that it is owned by local people (rather than just a large",
          "We literally hopped off the train at KM 104 with our amazing guide, Sara, who was introduced to us by our fabulous travel agent, Intense Peru. The start to the day was cool and a little moist. In no time we were climbing and removing layers as we began the 15+km (9-10 mike)",
          "We took the train to walk the Inca Trail. There was a lot of climbing steps to make it to Machu Picchu. It was a great experience with many wonderful sights along the trail. Well worth the effort!",
          "Having a day to hike the Inca Trail from Km 104 to Machu Picchu was wonderful - just the right length! The scenery is gorgeous, and we learned so much along the way.",
          "I'm 63 and in pretty good health/shape - pilates a couple times a week and hiking a couple times a week. I knew hiking the Inca Trail would be a challenge.....and it was. And it was worth it! I had a very slow pace (La Tortuga) but was able to minimize rest stops. I was",
          "There are a few Ica trails and we did the Salkantay pass and 4 day Ince trail. Amazing views and definitely worth doing!",
          "The tour of the Inca Trail is a once in a lifetime experience. From the unspoiled beauty of the landscape to the challenge of climbing ancient rock stairs built by the Incan's this trip will be one that you will look back on fondly.",
          "This truly is the only way to see Machu Picchu - by the time you arrive, you truly understand the significance and the journey. If you are in good physical shape, you should definitely make the trek versus taking the train.",
          "We hiked the Inka Trail as a family (50 something parents and their 2 kids in their 20s). I was a little worried because I'm not a backpacker. We trained by hiking some hills near our house and incline work on the treadmill. I'm in shape but not an athlete. I can honestly",
          "The Inca Trail was an amazing experience and one that I would definitely recommend if you enjoy hiking. Whilst it was easier than I expected, it definitely wasn't easy and does unfortunately depend on whether you are unlucky enough to be affected by altitude sickness although",
          "Amazing trail, trek could be hard if not mentally and physically prepared to take on the challenge of high altitude.",
          "Very hard trail . There is no other way to see some of the ruins and areas before reaching Machu Picchu. The landscape is tough to walk on , but if you enjoy hiking and camping and are in good physical shape, you should do this.",
          "Even if we go daily to the gym and love hiking, this was by far the toughtest hike we did in our entire life. The altitude makes it difficult but we were acclimatized thanks to the short alternative Rainbow Mountain hik and Sacred Valley visit we did two days before. Arriving in",
          "Staff was amazing. They answered all my questions. We would up doing only the shorter tour so I would take them again on a longer one.",
          "I did the Inca trail from KM 108. It was defiantly a hard and hot trek but the scenery along the way is breathtaking! You also get to see some other Inca ruins that you wouldn't have seen if you went directly to Machu Picchu. Highly recommend doing the Inca trail!",
          "4 days trekking on the trail, well worth it. Learnt about \u201cPeruvian flat\u201d which is undulating landscape. Day 2 - dead woman\u2019s pass was the greatest ascent and a hard slog up, but worth it when you reach the top, we were actually above the clouds looking down. Day 3 had a lot of",
          "This place is terrible and i belive it was the worst guides and helps ever everyone is usless there i hated it",
          "We did a five-mile section of the Inca Trail starting in Chinchero and hiked the descending trail down to Urquillos. Such an amazing experience! The trail descends pretty steeply at first. Walking sticks are recommended. Much better to be hiking downhill than up!",
          "Seems there are two basic ways to get to Machu Picchu (MP) - bus from Aquas Calientas or hike. And there are many hikes because there are many Inka trails. Common one is 4 day trek, but there are some 1-day options. We did a 1 day hike from a Peru Rail stop short of Aquas.",
          "Stunning, challenging and worth the effort! No photograph can come close to what you will experience. The food on the trail is excellent. Manny and Jorge were fantastic guides and the porters were terrific.",
          "We did the two tour/hike from point 106. Not for the weak or Un-fit as it is a steep uphill hike and with altitude and heat, it is hard. Well worth it when you see Macchi Picchu!",
          "Truly a bucket list adventure. Breathtaking hike through the Andes and history. Almost none of this trek is flat. First day is easiest. Second day is the potential killer, mostly uphill as you ascend to Dead Woman's Pass. BTW, its named for the appearance of a rock formation;",
          "We have hiked all over the world and nothing compared to this hike. You need to be in fairly good shape. It is 45 kilos going from 7500 to 14000 ft (Dead Woman's pass). We took 4 days. We had guides, porters, chefs, etc. Still a hard hike but worth every painful step. Many",
          "Breathtaking, worth the effort, high altitude so make sure you have plenty water. Guides are very hlpful, restaurants along teh way are simple but friendly and worth the stop. Did I remember to tell you to drink plenty of water? Good shoes would be wise, no flip flops or",
          "We just completed the Inca Trail, what an amazing adventure. It\u2019s very hard to put into words, exhilarating, emotional, exhausting, overwhelming, just wow!!! This has been something we have wanted to do for over 25 years and we finally ticked it off, it was so worth the wait.",
          "Did the Inca trail from Aguas Calientes to machupicchu pueblo, with a tour company the hike was tough at times but the views were so worth it a great lifetime experience! There is a plenty activities along thenway,from zip lining trough hot springs in colcamyo to white water",
          "Magical hike for 4 day\u2019s recommend 2 days at MP. Not for everyone, high altitude hard on some. Group of 8 perfect",

          "This was a bucket list trip to see Machu Picchu, Peru; and to hike the Inca Trail. After extensive research, I selected SA Expeditions to make the arrangements. The SA Expeditions representative, Sara, put together an 8 day tour with the 2-day Short Inca Trail to Machu Picchu",
          "Must see before more human destruction and natural tear and wear of this historical gem! I went with Alpaca Expedition for a 4D3N experiences. Though the trek is hard, but every step along the way, I am appreciating the blood and sweat people put in to build this massive site.",
          "Did the Inca Trail with a group of friends over 4 days. It\u2019s a wonderful hike with beautiful scenery and historical sites to see along the way. Pretty steep in places.",
          "Everyone knows when you come here you are going to see some incredible scenery and nature. It exceeded my expectations. Just a beautiful setting.",
          "If your health allows, a must see for everyone. You cannot appreciate the Incan culture without it. They were incredible craftsmen.",
          "Amazing its a tough trek but that might be because it was my first one. That being said the views and ruins along the trail are amazing. then when you finally reach the sun gate and see Machu Picchu for the first time the way the Inka did its unbelievable.",
          "This was a great time of year to do the Inca Trail. I went with Peru Treks who was an awesome company and I'd highly recommend them! end of March was a great time of year to go. We had great weather except the 3rd day which rained on us but we were prepared for it with ponchos!",

          "You don't need to be super fit to do the Inca Trail. It is demanding but accessible to the average person of any age. Be realistic about your abilities though - the are some steep stairs and narrow ledges; with my bad knee and my wife's fear of height we managed to complete the",
          "It's an adventure and is worth the effort. The sights and sounds along the way make the journey probably as enjoyable as reaching Machu Picchu. It's worth putting some effort into getting into shape prior to the trip and having the right stuff, but a positive attitude and",
          "The trail is a must for all that truly want to experience peruvian nature and history and have the strenght to do it. It is not an easy hike, it gets draining day after day, with sleeping in tents and eating in weird times. But the views are amazing!!! A few tips: check the",
          "The four day Inca trail was a really great experience! I recommend it to people who are fit and have some experience in hiking, it will be easier this way. The food and service provided from agency Peru Treks during the trail was above all professional and even more than that,",
          "This one is easy-coolest thing i have ever done, if you like hiking, the outdoors, a challenge and spectacular sights sign up!! The sacred valley and Cusco are also very cool spots to check out. Take the Hiram Bingham train back to Cusco after hiking the trail, its also well",

          "Hiking the Inca Trail was easily one of the best travel decisions I've ever made. Of course, I was excited about going to see Machu Picchu, but I didn't expect to love the hike so much. Yes, it is challenging and strenuous, and you should probably enjoy hiking and physically",

          "We saw the beginning of an Inca trail outside Cusco. It was a short stop on a guided tour. To see the stone path and realize they made thousands of miles of trails with these stones is just overwhelming. The water fountain feature was interesting also.",
          "We did the trek in mid-September, in the window month between the wet and dry seasons, it was mostly dry and sunny with a few outbreaks of rain on the last day. The scenery was awe inspiring and each of the 4 days goes through a completely different ecosystem of plants and",

          "It's challenging to be sure, but so worth it. I thought that Machu Picchu was going to be the highlight - the ultimate reward, but it turned out that the hike itself was the best part. Being able to visit several other spectacular Inca sites along the trail with no",

        "wiki": "Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.For most speakers of English or Spanish, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent. In English, the name is pronounced  or ,\nin Spanish as [\u02c8mat\u0283u \u02c8pit\u0283u] or [\u02c8mat\u0283u \u02c8pikt\u0283u],\nand in Quechua (Machu Pikchu) as [\u02c8mat\u0283\u028a \u02c8p\u026akt\u0283\u028a].\nMost archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438\u20131472). Often mistakenly referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\", it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.\nMachu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the Quechua language, machu means \"old\" or \"old person\", while pikchu means either \"portion of coca being chewed\" or \"pyramid, pointed multi-sided solid; cone\". Thus the name of the site is sometimes interpreted as \"old mountain\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMachu Picchu is believed (by Richard L. Burger) to be built starting 1450\u20131460. Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438\u20131471) and T\u00fapac Inca Yupanqui (1472\u20131493). There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after a successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a \"royal\" estate, surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.\n\n\n=== Daily life in Machu Picchu ===\nDuring its use as a royal estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived there, with most serving as support staff (yanaconas, yana) who lived there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (mayocs) lived there as well, most likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staff dropped down to around a hundred servants and a few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone.Studies show that according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been living there their whole lives. Instead, there was bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long-term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart. These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the overall most recent short-term diet for these people was composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake. Most skeletal remains found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures than those found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals who had arthritis and bone fractures were typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit'a) or served in the Inca military.\n\nAnimals are also suspected to have migrated to Machu Picchu as there were several bones found that were not native to the area. Most animal bones found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live at altitudes of 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) rather than the 2,400 metres (7,900 ft) elevation of Machu Picchu. Most likely, these animals were brought in from the Puna region for meat consumption and for their pelts. Guinea pigs were also found at the site in special burial caves, suggesting that they were at least used for funerary rituals, as it was common throughout the Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat. Six dogs were also recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains, it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nMuch of the farming done at Machu Picchu was done on its hundreds of man-made terraces. These terraces were a work of considerable engineering, built to ensure good drainage and soil fertility while also protecting the mountain itself from erosion and landslides. However, the terraces were not perfect, as studies of the land show that there were landslides that happened during the construction of Machu Picchu. Still visible are places where the terraces were shifted by landslides and then stabilized by the Inca as they continued to build around the area.It is estimated that the area around the site has received more than 1,800 mm (71 in) of rain per year since AD 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built by Incan engineers specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by  Kenneth Wright  in the 1990s showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel. On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was shown that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much better than the soil higher up the mountain.However, it has been found that the terrace farming area makes up only about 4.9 ha (12 acres) of land, and a study of the soil around the terraces showed that what was grown there was mostly corn and potatoes, which was not enough to support the 750+ people living at Machu Picchu. This explains why when studies were done on the food that the Inca ate at Machu Picchu, it was found that most of what they ate was imported from the surrounding valleys and farther afield.\n\n\n=== Encounters ===\nEven though Machu Picchu was located only about 80 kilometers (50 mi) from the Inca capital in Cusco, the Spanish never found it and so did not plunder or destroy it, as they did many other sites. The conquistadors had notes of a place called Piccho, although no record of a Spanish visit exists. Unlike other locations, sacred rocks often defaced by the conquistadors remain untouched at Machu Picchu.Over the centuries, the surrounding jungle overgrew the site, and few outside the immediate area knew of its existence. The site may have been discovered and plundered in 1867 by a German businessman, Augusto Berns. Some evidence indicates that the German engineer J. M. von Hassel arrived earlier. Maps show references to Machu Picchu as early as 1874.In 1911 American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham traveled the region looking for the old Inca capital and was led to Machu Picchu by a villager, Melchor Arteaga. Bingham found the name Agust\u00edn Liz\u00e1rraga and the date 1902 written in charcoal on one of the walls. Though Bingham was not the first to visit the ruins, he was considered the scientific discoverer who brought Machu Picchu to international attention. Bingham organized another expedition in 1912 to undertake major clearing and excavation.In 1981, Peru declared an area of 325.92 square kilometres (125.84 sq mi) surrounding Machu Picchu a \"historic sanctuary\". In addition to the ruins, the sanctuary includes a large portion of the adjoining region, rich with the flora and fauna of the Peruvian Yungas and Central Andean wet puna ecoregions.In 1983, UNESCO designated Machu Picchu a World Heritage site, describing it as \"an absolute masterpiece of architecture and a unique testimony to the Inca civilization\".\n\n\n=== First American expedition ===\n\nBingham was a lecturer at Yale University, although not a trained archaeologist. In 1909, returning from the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Santiago, he travelled through Peru and was invited to explore the Inca ruins at Choqquequirau in the Apur\u00edmac Valley. He organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition in part to search for the Inca capital, which was thought to be the city of Vitcos. He consulted Carlos Romero, one of the chief historians in Lima who showed him helpful references and Father Antonio de la Calancha\u2019s Chronicle of the Augustinians. In particular, Ramos thought Vitcos was \"near a great white rock over a spring of fresh water.\" Back in Cusco again, Bingham asked planters about the places mentioned by Calancha, particularly along the Urubamba River. According to Bingham, \"one old prospector said there were interesting ruins at Machu Picchu,\" though his statements \"were given no importance by the leading citizens.\" Only later did Bingham learn that Charles Wiener also heard of the ruins at Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu, but was unable to reach them.\n\nArmed with this information the expedition went down the Urubamba River. En route, Bingham asked local people to show them Inca ruins, especially any place described as having a white rock over a spring.At Mandor Pampa, Bingham asked farmer and innkeeper Melchor Arteaga if he knew of any nearby ruins. Arteaga said he knew of excellent ruins on the top of Huayna Picchu. The next day, 24 July, Arteaga led Bingham and Sergeant Carrasco across the river on a log bridge and up the Huayna Picchu mountain. At the top of the mountain, they came across a small hut occupied by a couple of Quechua, Richard and Alvarez, who were farming some of the original Machu Picchu agricultural terraces that they had cleared four years earlier. Alvarez's 11-year-old son, Pablito, led Bingham along the ridge to the main ruins.The ruins were mostly covered with vegetation except for the cleared agricultural terraces and clearings used by the farmers as vegetable gardens. Because of the vegetation, Bingham was not able to observe the full extent of the site. He took preliminary notes, measurements, and photographs, noting the fine quality of Inca stonework of several principal buildings. Bingham was unclear about the original purpose of the ruins, but decided that there was no indication that it matched the description of Vitcos.The expedition continued down the Urubamba and up the Vilcabamba Rivers examining all the ruins they could find. Guided by locals, Bingham rediscovered and correctly identified the site of the old Inca capital, Vitcos (then called Rosaspata), and the nearby temple of Chuquipalta. He then crossed a pass and into the Pampaconas Valley where he found more ruins heavily buried in the jungle undergrowth at Esp\u00edritu Pampa, which he named \"Trombone Pampa\". As was the case with Machu Picchu, the site was so heavily overgrown that Bingham could only note a few of the buildings. In 1964, Gene Savoy further explored the ruins at Espiritu Pampa and revealed the full extent of the site, identifying it as Vilcabamba Viejo, where the Incas fled after the Spanish drove them from Vitcos.Bingham returned to Machu Picchu in 1912 under the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic again and with the full support of Peruvian President Leguia. The expedition undertook a four-month clearing of the site with local labour, which was expedited with the support of the Prefect of Cuzco. Excavation started in 1912 with further excavation undertaken in 1914 and 1915. Bingham focused on Machu Picchu because of its fine Inca stonework and well-preserved nature, which had lain undisturbed since the site was abandoned. None of Bingham's several hypotheses explaining the site held up. During his studies, he carried various artifacts back to Yale. One prominent artifact was a set of 15th-century, ceremonial Incan knives made from bismuth bronze; they are the earliest known artifact containing this alloy.Although local institutions initially welcomed the exploration, they soon accused Bingham of legal and cultural malpractice. Rumors arose that the team was stealing artifacts and smuggling them out of Peru through Bolivia. (In fact, Bingham removed many artifacts, but openly and legally; they were deposited in the Yale University Museum. Bingham was abiding by the 1852 Civil Code of Peru; the code stated that \"archaeological finds generally belonged to the discoverer, except when they had been discovered on private land.\" (Batievsky 100) ) Local press perpetuated the accusations, claiming that the excavation harmed the site and deprived local archaeologists of knowledge about their own history. Landowners began to demand rent from the excavators. By the time Bingham and his team left Machu Picchu, locals had formed coalitions to defend their ownership of Machu Picchu and its cultural remains, while Bingham claimed the artifacts ought to be studied by experts in American institutions.\n\n\n=== Human sacrifice and mysticism ===\nLittle information describes human sacrifices at Machu Picchu, though many sacrifices were never given a proper burial, and their skeletal remains succumbed to the elements. However, there is evidence that retainers were sacrificed to accompany a deceased noble in the afterlife. Animal, liquid and dirt sacrifices to the gods were more common, made at the Altar of the Condor. The tradition is upheld by members of the New Age Andean religion.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nMachu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator. It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,400 metres (11,200 ft). As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.\nMachu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the majority of the annual rain falling from October through to March.Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480 ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river. The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20 ft).\nThe city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\n\n=== Layout ===\n\nThe site is roughly divided into an urban sector and an agricultural sector, and into an upper town and a lower town. The temples are in the upper town, the warehouses in the lower.The architecture is adapted to the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east\u2013west central square. The various compounds, called kanchas, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern section of the city was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the Torre\u00f3n, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.Located in the first zone are the primary archaeological treasures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows. These were dedicated to Inti, their sun god and greatest deity.\nThe Popular District, or Residential District, is the place where the lower-class people lived. It includes storage buildings and simple houses.\nThe royalty area, a sector for the nobility, is a group of houses located in rows over a slope; the residence of the amautas (wise persons) was characterized by its reddish walls, and the zone of the \u00f1ustas (princesses) had trapezoid-shaped rooms. The Monumental Mausoleum is a carved statue with a vaulted interior and carved drawings. It was used for rites or sacrifices.\nThe Guardhouse is a three-sided building, with one of its long sides opening onto the Terrace of the Ceremonial Rock. The three-sided style of Inca architecture is known as the wayrona style.In 2005 and 2009, the University of Arkansas made detailed laser scans of the entire site and of the ruins at the top of the adjacent Huayna Picchu mountain. The scan data is available online for research purposes.\n\n\n=== Temple of the Sun or Torreon ===\nThis semicircular temple is built on the same rock overlying Bingham's \"Royal Mausoleum\", and is similar to the Temple of the Sun found in Cusco and the Temple of the Sun found in Pisac, in having what Bingham described as a \"parabolic enclosure wall\". The stonework is of ashlar quality. Within the temple is a 1.2 m by 2.7 m rock platform, smooth on top except for a small platform on its southwest quadrant. A \"Serpent's Door\" faces 340\u00b0, or just west of north, opening onto a series of 16 pools, and affording a view of Huayna Picchu. The temple also has two trapezoidal windows, one facing 65\u00b0, called the \"Solstice Window\", and the other facing 132\u00b0, called the \"Qullqa Window\". The northwest edge of the rock platform points out the Solstice Window to within 2\u2019 of the 15th century June solstice rising Sun. For comparison, the angular diameter of the Sun is 32'. The Inca constellation Qullca, storehouse, can be viewed out the Qullqa Window at sunset during the 15th-century June Solstice, hence the window's name. At the same time, the Pleaides are at the opposite end of the sky. Also seen through this window on this night are the constellations Llamacnawin, Llama, Unallamacha, Machacuay, and the star Pachapacariq Chaska (Canopus).\n\n\n=== Intihuatana stone ===\n\nThe Intihuatana stone is one of many ritual stones in South America. These stones are arranged to point directly at the sun during the winter solstice. The name of the stone (perhaps coined by Bingham) derives from Quechua language: inti means \"sun\", and wata-, \"to tie, hitch (up)\". The suffix -na derives nouns for tools or places. Hence Intihuatana is literally an instrument or place to \"tie up the sun\", often expressed in English as \"The Hitching Post of the Sun\". The Inca believed the stone held the sun in its place along its annual path in the sky. The stone is situated at 13\u00b09'48\" S. At midday on 11 November and 30 January, the sun stands almost exactly above the pillar, casting no shadow. On 21 June, the stone casts the longest shadow on its southern side, and on 21 December a much shorter shadow on its northern side.\n\n\n=== Inti Mach'ay and the Royal Feast of the Sun ===\nInti Mach'ay is a special cave used to observe the Royal Feast of the Sun. This festival was celebrated during the Incan month of Qhapaq Raymi. It began earlier in the month and concluded on the December solstice. On this day, noble boys were initiated into manhood by an ear-piercing ritual as they stood inside the cave and watched the sunrise.Architecturally, Inti Mach'ay is the most significant structure at Machu Picchu. Its entrances, walls, steps, and windows are some of the finest masonry in the Incan Empire. The cave also includes a tunnel-like window unique among Incan structures, which was constructed to allow sunlight into the cave only during several days around the December solstice. For this reason, the cave was inaccessible for much of the year. Inti Mach'ay is located on the eastern side of Machu Picchu, just north of the \"Condor Stone.\" Many of the caves surrounding this area were prehistorically used as tombs, yet there is no evidence that Mach'ay was a burial ground.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe central buildings use the classical Inca architectural style of polished dry-stone walls of regular shape. The Incas were masters of this technique, called ashlar, in which blocks of stone are cut to fit together tightly without mortar.\nThe site itself may have been intentionally built on fault lines to afford better drainage and a ready supply of fractured stone.  \"Machu Picchu clearly shows us that the Incan civilization was an empire of fractured rocks\".The section of the mountain where Machu Picchu was built provided various challenges that the Incas solved with local materials. One issue was the seismic activity due to two fault lines. It made mortar and similar building methods nearly useless. Instead, the Inca mined stones from the quarry at the site, lined them up and shaped them to fit together perfectly, stabilizing the structures. Inca walls have many stabilizing features: doors and windows are trapezoidal, narrowing from bottom to top; corners usually are rounded; inside corners often incline slightly into the rooms, and outside corners were often tied together by \"L\"-shaped blocks; walls are offset slightly from row to row rather than rising straight from bottom to top.\nHeavy rainfall required terraces and stone chips to drain rain water and prevent mudslides, landslides, erosion, and flooding. Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt, and topsoil, to absorb water and prevent it from running down the mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding. Multiple canals and reserves throughout the city provided water that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation and to prevent erosion and flooding.\nThe Incas never used wheels in a practical way, although their use in toys shows that they knew the principle. The use of wheels in engineering may have been limited due to the lack of strong draft animals, combined with steep terrain and dense vegetation. The approach to moving and placing the enormous stones remains uncertain, probably involving hundreds of men to push the stones up inclines. A few stones have knobs that could have been used to lever them into position; the knobs were generally sanded away, with a few overlooked.\n\n\n=== Roads and transportation ===\nThe Inca road system included a route to the Machu Picchu region. The people of Machu Picchu were connected to long-distance trade, as shown by non-local artifacts found at the site. For example, Bingham found unmodified obsidian nodules at the entrance gateway. In the 1970s, Burger and Asaro determined that these obsidian samples were from the Titicaca or Chivay obsidian source, and that the samples from Machu Picchu showed long-distance transport of this obsidian type in pre-Hispanic Peru.Thousands of tourists walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year. They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) near the town of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, walking up through the Andes to the isolated city.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nMachu Picchu is both a cultural and natural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since its discovery in 1911, growing numbers of tourists have visited the site each year, including 1,411,279 in 2017. As Peru's most visited tourist attraction and major revenue generator, it is continually exposed to economic and commercial forces. In the late 1990s, the Peruvian government granted concessions to allow the construction of a cable car and a luxury hotel, including a tourist complex with boutiques and restaurants and a bridge to the site. Many people protested the plans, including Peruvians and foreign scientists, saying that more visitors would pose a physical burden on the ruins. In 2018, plans were restarted to again construct a cable car to encourage Peruvians to visit Machu Picchu and boost domestic tourism. A no-fly zone exists above the area. UNESCO is considering putting Machu Picchu on its List of World Heritage in Danger.During the 1980s a large rock from Machu Picchu's central plaza was moved to a different location to create a helicopter landing zone. In the 1990s, the government prohibited helicopter landings. In 2006, a Cusco-based company, Helicusco, sought approval for tourist flights over Machu Picchu. The resulting license was soon rescinded.Tourist deaths have been linked to altitude sickness, floods and hiking accidents. UNESCO received criticism for allowing tourists at the location given high risks of landslides, earthquakes and injury due to decaying structures.In 2014 nude tourism was a trend at Machu Picchu and Peru's Ministry of Culture denounced the activity. Cusco's Regional Director of Culture increased surveillance to end the practice.\n\n\n=== January 2010 evacuation ===\n\nIn January 2010, heavy rain caused flooding that buried or washed away roads and railways to Machu Picchu, trapping more than 2,000 locals and more than 2,000 tourists, later airlifted out to safety. Machu Picchu was temporarily closed, reopening on 1 April 2010.\n\n\n=== Entrance restrictions ===\n\nIn July 2011, the Direcci\u00f3n Regional de Cultura Cusco (DRC) introduced new entrance rules to the citadel of Machu Picchu. The tougher entrance rules attempted to reduce the effects of tourism. Entrance was limited to 2,500 visitors per day, and entrance to Huayna Picchu (within the citadel) was further restricted to 400 visitors per day. In 2018, additional restrictions were placed on entrance. Three entrance phases will be implemented, increased from two phases previously, to further help the flow of traffic and reduce degradation of the site due to tourism.In May 2012, a team of UNESCO conservation experts called upon Peruvian authorities to take \"emergency measures\" to further stabilize the site's buffer zone and protect it from damage, particularly in the nearby town of Aguas Calientes, which had grown rapidly.\n\n\n=== Cultural artifacts: Dispute between Peru and Yale University ===\n\nIn 1912, 1914 and 1915, Bingham removed thousands of artifacts from Machu Picchu\u2014ceramic vessels, silver statues, jewelry, and human bones\u2014and took them to Yale University for further study, supposedly for 18 months. Yale instead kept the artifacts until 2012, arguing that Peru lacked the infrastructure and systems to care for them. Eliane Karp, an anthropologist and wife of former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, accused Yale of profiting from Peru's cultural heritage. Many of the articles were exhibited at Yale's Peabody Museum.\nIn 2006, Yale returned some pieces but kept the rest, claiming this was supported by federal case law of Peruvian antiquities. In 2007, Peru and Yale had agreed on a joint traveling exhibition and construction of a new museum and research center in Cusco advised by Yale. Yale acknowledged Peru's title to all the objects, but would share rights with Peru in the research collection, part of which would remain at Yale for continuing study. In November 2010, Yale agreed to return the disputed artifacts. The third and final batch of artifacts was delivered November 2012. The artifacts are permanently exhibited at the Museo Machu Picchu, La Casa Concha (\"The Shell House\"), close to Cusco's colonial center. Owned by the National University of San Antonio Abad del Cusco, La Casa Concha also features a study area for local and foreign students.\n\n\n== In media ==\n\n\n=== Motion pictures ===\nThe Paramount Pictures film Secret of the Incas (1955), with Charlton Heston and Ima Sumac, was filmed on location at Cusco and Machu Picchu, the first time that a major Hollywood studio filmed on site. Five hundred indigenous people were hired as extras in the film.The opening sequence of the film Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) was shot in the Machu Picchu area and on the stone stairway of Huayna Picchu.Machu Picchu was featured prominently in the film The Motorcycle Diaries (2004), a biopic based on the 1952 youthful travel memoir of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.The NOVA television documentary \"Ghosts of Machu Picchu\" presents an elaborate documentary on the mysteries of Machu Picchu.Multimedia artist Kimsooja used footage shot near Macchu Picchu in the first episode of her film series Thread Routes, shot in 2010.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe song \"Kilimanjaro\", from the South Indian Tamil film Enthiran (2010), was filmed in Machu Picchu. The sanction for filming was granted only after direct intervention from the Indian government.\n\n\n== Panoramic views ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBingham, Hiram (2010).

It is perched above the Urubamba River valley in a narrow saddle between two sharp peaks\u2014Machu Picchu (\u201cOld Peak\u201d) and Huayna Picchu (\u201cNew Peak\u201d)\u2014at an elevation of 7,710 feet (2,350 metres).

However, Machu Picchu\u2019s existence was not widely known in the West until it was \u201cdiscovered\u201d in 1911 by the Yale University professor Hiram Bingham, who was led to the site by Melchor Arteaga, a local Quechua-speaking resident. Bingham had been seeking Vilcabamba (Vilcapampa), the \u201clost city of the Incas,\u201d from which the last Inca rulers led a rebellion against Spanish rule until 1572. He cited evidence from his 1912 excavations at Machu Picchu, which were sponsored by Yale University and the National Geographic Society, in his labeling of the site as Vilcabamba; however, that interpretation is no longer widely accepted. (Nevertheless, many sources still follow Bingham\u2019s precedent and erroneously label Machu Picchu as the \u201clost city of the Incas.\u201d) Evidence later associated Vilcabamba with another ruin, Esp\u00edritu Pampa, which was also discovered by Bingham. In 1964 Esp\u00edritu Pampa was extensively excavated under the direction of the American explorer Gene Savoy. The site was much deteriorated and overgrown with forest, but Savoy uncovered remains there of some 300 Inca houses and 50 or more other buildings, as well as extensive terraces, proving that Esp\u00edritu Pampa was a much larger settlement.Hiram Bingham at Machu Picchu, Peru, 1912.Yale University Peabody Museum of Natural HistoryMachu PicchuTime-lapse video of Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 Mattia Bicchi Photography, www.mattiabicchiphotography.com (A Britannica Publishing Partner)See all videos for this articleMachu Picchu was further excavated in 1915 by Bingham, in 1934 by the Peruvian archaeologist Luis E. Valcarcel, and in 1940\u201341 by Paul Fejos. Additional discoveries throughout the Cordillera de Vilcabamba have shown that Machu Picchu was one of a series of pucaras (fortified sites), tambos (travelers\u2019 barracks, or inns), and signal towers along the extensive Inca foot highway.The dwellings at Machu Picchu were probably built and occupied from the mid-15th to the early or mid-16th century. Machu Picchu\u2019s construction style and other evidence suggest that it was a palace complex of the ruler Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui (reigned c. 1438\u201371). Several dozen skeletons were excavated there in 1912, and, because most of those were initially identified as female, Bingham suggested that Machu Picchu was a sanctuary for the Virgins of the Sun (the Chosen Women), an elite Inca group. Technology at the turn of the 21st-century, however, identified a significant proportion of males and a great diversity in physical types. Both skeletal and material remains now suggest to scholars that Machu Picchu served as a royal retreat. The reason for the site\u2019s abandonment is also unknown, but lack of water may have been a factor.Machu Picchu: Inca dwellingsInca dwellings at Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nThe high level of preservation and the general layout of the ruin are remarkable. Its southern, eastern, and western portions are surrounded by dozens of stepped agricultural terraces formerly watered by an aqueduct system. Some of those terraces were still being used by local Indians when Bingham arrived in 1911. Walkways and thousands of steps, consisting of stone blocks as well as footholds carved into underlying rock, connect the plazas, the residential areas, the terraces, the cemetery, and the major buildings. The Main Plaza, partly divided by wide terraces, is at the north-central end of the site. At the southeastern end is the only formal entrance, which leads to the Inca Trail.Machu Picchu.\u00a9 Digital Vision/Getty ImagesMachu Picchu: stepped terraces and dwellingsStepped agricultural terraces and dwellings at Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Machu Picchu: industrial areaIndustrial area at Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Few of Machu Picchu\u2019s white granite structures have stonework as highly refined as that found in Cuzco, but several are worthy of note. In the southern part of the ruin is the Sacred Rock, also known as the Temple of the Sun (it was called the Mausoleum by Bingham). It centres on an inclined rock mass with a small grotto; walls of cut stone fill in some of its irregular features. Rising above the rock is the horseshoe-shaped enclosure known as the Military Tower. In the western part of Machu Picchu is the temple district, also known as the Acropolis. The Temple of the Three Windows is a hall 35 feet (10.6 metres) long and 14 feet (4.2 metres) wide with three trapezoidal windows (the largest known in Inca architecture) on one wall, which is built of polygonal stones. It stands near the southwestern corner of the Main Plaza. Also near the Main Plaza is the Intihuatana (Hitching Post of the Sun), a uniquely preserved ceremonial sundial consisting of a wide pillar and pedestal that were carved as a single unit and stand 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall. In 2000 this feature was damaged during the filming of a beer commercial. The Princess\u2019s Palace is a bi-level structure of highly crafted stonework that probably housed a member of the Inca nobility. The Palace of the Inca is a complex of rooms with niched walls and a courtyard. At the other end of Machu Picchu, another path leads to the famous Inca Bridge, a rope structure that crosses the Urubamba River. Many other ruined cities\u2014like that atop the dark peak of Huayna Picchu, which is accessible by a lengthy, precipitous stairway and trail\u2014were built in the region; Machu Picchu is only the most extensively excavated of these.Machu PicchuFinely crafted stonework of the Temple of the Sun is juxtaposed with less-skilled construction (foreground) at Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 kcullen/FotoliaMachu Picchu is the most economically important tourist attraction in Peru, bringing in visitors from around the world. For this reason the Peruvian government wishes to repatriate the materials taken by Bingham to Yale. The ruins are commonly reached in a day trip from Cuzco by first taking a narrow-gauge railway and then ascending nearly 1,640 feet (500 metres) from the Urubamba River valley on a serpentine road. Smaller numbers of visitors arrive by hiking the Inca Trail. The portion of the trail from the \u201ckm 88\u201d train stop to Machu Picchu is normally hiked in three to six days. It is composed of several thousand stone-cut steps, numerous high retaining walls, tunnels, and other feats of classical engineering; the route traverses a wide range of elevations between about 8,530 and 13,780 feet (2,600 and 4,200 metres), and it is lined with Inca ruins of various types and sizes. At Machu Picchu there is a hotel with a restaurant, and thermal baths are at the nearby village of Aguas Calientes. The Inca Bridge and other parts of Machu Picchu were damaged by a forest fire in August 1997, but restoration was begun immediately afterward. Concern for the damage caused by tourism was heightened by discussion of the building of a cable-car link to the site.Machu PicchuView of the Urubamba River valley from the ruins at Machu Picchu, Peru.\u00a9 sphraner/Fotolia ",

        "wiki": "The Lethal Legion is the name of seven teams of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first version of the Lethal Legion appeared in The Avengers #78 (Jul. 1970).The second version of the Lethal Legion appeared in Avengers #164 (Oct. 1977)\nThe third version in West Coast Avengers vol. 2, #1 (Oct. 1985).\nThe fourth version appeared in Marvel Age Annual #1 (1985).\nThe fifth version of the Lethal Legion appeared in Avengers West Coast #98 (Sep. 1993)\nThe sixth version of the Lethal Legion appeared in the limited series Dark Reign: Lethal Legion #1 (Aug. 2009).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Grim Reaper's Lethal Legion ===\nThe original Lethal Legion are formed by the villain Grim Reaper (the brother of Avenger Wonder Man) and consisted of Man-Ape, Power Man, Living Laser, and Swordsman. Man-Ape attacks Captain America, but is beaten back by the Avengers. However, he captures the Black Panther's girlfriend Monica binding her hand and foot with metal clamps. Black Panther is lured into a trap by Man-Ape, and despite getting past him he is knocked out by an exploding dummy of Monica. Black Panther is chained and with Man-Ape, he meets the other members of the Lethal Legion.Grim Reaper dispatched the Lethal Legion members to different locations to meet the Avengers. Power Man and Swordsman were sent to the water main below Avengers Mansion, Living Laser and Man-Ape were sent to the nearby power station, and Grim Reaper seemingly departed to Greenwich Village. Black Panther broke free and contacted the Avengers to warn them about the Lethal Legion's plot. Grim Reaper returns and uses the knockout gas in his scythe to knock out Black Panther while revealing that he planned to have the Avengers lured to the locations of which Black Panther knew about. While the other members of the Lethal Legion defeat the different Avengers, Vision defeats Power Man (who had been sent to capture him at Avengers Mansion). He disguises himself as Power Man and Power Man as him and takes him to the base. The Lethal Legion places the Avengers in an hourglass container and then fills it with deadly gas. When \"Power Man\" arrived with \"Vision,\" Grim Reaper detected the brain patterns of Wonder Man and shattered the hourglass to save Vision's life only to realize that the vision in the hourglass was actually Power Man. At that point, Vision aided the Avengers into defeating the Lethal Legion who are handed over to the authorities.\n\n\n=== Count Nefaria's Lethal Legion ===\nA second version, formed by European villain Count Nefaria reappears in the title, composed of Living Laser, Whirlwind and Power Man. He magnifies their powers, but is revealed to be a manipulative ploy to steal their magnified powers in a failed bid to destroy the Avengers. The depowered villains are sent to prison.\n\n\n=== Grim Reaper's second Lethal Legion ===\nThe Grim Reaper returns in the title West Coast Avengers, leading a third version against the superhero team consisting of Black Talon (Barone), Goliath, Man-Ape, Nekra, and Ultron-12. Grim Reaper has Ultron lead a squadron of robots to spring Goliath from a compound that he is imprisoned in. When Goliath is freed by Man-Ape, the three villains work together to take out the Avengers as Ultron-12 states that he has his own plans for Wonder Man. The three villains escape with an unconscious Henry Pym and Wonder Man. Hawkeye figures out that Grim Reaper is behind this.The three villains meet up with Grim Reaper. Internal squabbling and personal agendas overtake the villains and they are defeated and scattered.\n\n\n=== Porcupine's Lethal Legion ===\nA fourth version appears in the title Marvel Age. They were led by the Porcupine and consisted of Attuma, Batroc the Leaper, Bulldozer, Black Tiger, Kurr'fri of the Saurians, Gorilla-Man (Nagan), Piledriver, Sabretooth, Thundra, Trapster, Unicorn, Whirlwind, and Wrecker. The Lethal Legion tracked down and battle Captain America who is aided by several other Marvel heroes. Their battle with the superheroes was witnessed by the Beyonder. The outcome of the battle was not shown, but it is assumed that the heroes won.\n\n\n=== Satannish's Lethal Legion ===\nIn the title Avengers West Coast the demon Satannish creates another version using the souls of four infamous historical killers that were found in Mephisto's section of Hell. They have been given powers along with Hangman and the group battle the renamed Avengers West Coast. The group consisted of Axe of Violence (a demonically-enhanced version of Lizzie Borden with an axe replacing one hand), Coldsteel (a demonically-enhanced version of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, now an 8 ft. giant with superhuman strength), Cyana (a demonically-enhanced version of Lucrezia Borgia with poisoned claws), and Zyklon (a demonically-enhanced version of Nazi official Heinrich Himmler who can belch deadly gas fumes from his mouth). This incarnation eventually lost their powers and their souls were destroyed during the struggle between Mephisto and Satannish.\n\n\n=== Grim Reaper's third Lethal Legion ===\nA new version of the Lethal Legion appears during the \"Dark Reign\" storyline in the three-issue limited series Dark Reign: Lethal Legion. The Grim Reaper (now aided by his brother Wonder Man) recruits villains to oppose criminal mastermind Norman Osborn.Absorbing Man, Grey Gargoyle, Mister Hyde, and Tiger Shark later reformed the Lethal Legion and end up fighting the Avengers.\n\n\n=== Challenger's Lethal Legion ===\nAn alien version of the Lethal Legion was formed by Grandmaster to go up against Challenger's Black Order in a contest where Earth is the battlefield and they had to collect the Pyramoids. While the Blood Brothers, Mentacle, and Metal Master II faced off against Black Dwarf, Black Swan, and Supergiant's psychic projection in Rome, Captain Glory, Drall, and Ferene the Other faced off against Corvus Glaive, Ebony Maw, and Proxima Midnight in Cusco, Peru. Both of these confrontations were interrupted by the Avengers.Each of its members were revealed to have been saved from their approaching deaths in exchange that they partake in his contest against Challenger.When Challenger reveals his secret player in the form of a resurrected Hulk, most of the Lethal Legion are defeated with Hulk breaking Captain Glory's spine and presumably killing Mentacle.After the contest is ended by the Avengers, the Lethal Legion regrouped and fled to Knowhere. As they have nowhere to return to after each one's near-death experience, the Lethal Legion decides to stay together and see what they can accomplish.\n\n\n=== Count Nefaria's second Lethal Legion ===\nA wheelchair-bound Count Nefaria forms another version of the Lethal Legion which now consists of Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind. The group raids a Project Pegasus facility to look for the Catalyst so that Count Nefaria can regain his powers. He revealed to the scientist that mentioned it was relocated that he got a copy of the information from Chameleon as the scientist knows the Catalyst's full potential. Count Nefaria kills the scientist with his abilities so that he won't tell anyone how to stop him. When Whirlwind and Living Laser stated to Count Nefaria that he should be resting, Count Nefaria stated that he needed the exercise.At Empire State University, Dr. Curt Connors reveals the Catalyst to the crowd when the Lethal Legion attacks. While Grey Gargoyle and Whirlwind attack the people present, Living Laser helps Count Nefaria to operate the Catalyst. Spider-Man shows up and has a hard time fighting them due to the fact that his mind was focused on what a revived Sin-Eater did to Overdrive. Sin-Eater shows up and starts using the same gun he used on Overdrive on Whirlwind and Grey Gargoyle while taking their powers. Immobilizing Spider-Man with Grey Gargoyle's powers, Sin-Eater proceeded to do the same thing to Living Laser and Count Nefaria. All four of them were sent to Ravencroft where they started to act like model inmates. Norah Winters was allowed by Norman Osborn to interview them about Sin-Eater.\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n\n=== Heroes Reborn ===\nIn the Heroes Reborn reality, the Lethal Legion was formed by Enchantress and consisted of Executioner, Scarlet Witch, Ultron-5, and Wonder Man The Lethal Legion is later betrayed by Loki who takes the Gamma Core's energy for himself.\n\n\n== In other media ==\nThe Lethal Legion appears in The Super Hero Squad Show. This version happens to be a result of Doctor Doom forging alliances with every known villain to help him in his quest to get all the Infinity Fractals that make up the Infinity Sword.\nThe Lethal Legion appears in the Marvel Super Hero Squad video game.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLethal Legion at Marvel.com\nLethal Legion I at Marvel Wiki\nLethal Legion II at Marvel Wiki\nLethal Legion IV at Marvel Wiki\nLethal Legion V at Marvel Wiki\nLethal Legion VI at Marvel Wiki\nLethal Legion I at Marvel Appendix\nLethal Legion IV at Marvel Appendix\nLethal Legion V at Marvel Appendix\nLethal Legion at the Comic Book DB (archived from the original)",

        "wiki": "Vinicunca, or Winikunka, also called Monta\u00f1a de Siete Colores, Monta\u00f1a de Colores or Rainbow Mountain, is a mountain in the Andes of Peru with an altitude of 5,200 meters above sea level.Tourist access requires a two-hour drive from Cusco, and a walk of about 5-kilometer (3.1 mi) or three-and-a-half-hour drive through Pitumarca and one-half-kilometre (0.31 mi) a steep walk (1-1.5 hours) to the hill. As of 2019, no robust methods of transportation to Vinicunca have been developed to accommodate travelers, as it requires passage through a valley.It is located on the road to the Ausangate mountain, in the Andes of Peru, in the Cusco Region, between the districts of Cusipata, province of Quispicanchi, Pitumarca, and the province of Canchis.In the middle of the 2010s, mass tourism became attracted by the mountains' series of stripes of various colors. This due to its mineralogical composition present on the slopes and summits. The mountain was covered by glacier caps that have melted recently due to global warming.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nVinicunca is located to the southeast of the city of Cusco and can be reached from Cusco via two routes: Cusipata or Pitumarca.  One route is through the Peruvian Sierra del Sur (PE-3s) in the direction of the town of Checacupe, and further to the town of Pitumarca, which is around  two hours from the city of Cusco. From Pitumarca, travellers may go by foot, by car or motorbike along a trail passing through several rural communities such as Ocefina, Japura, Hanchipacha, and reach the community of Pampa Chiri, where a 1.5-kilometer walk along the Vinincunca pass leads to the natural formation with stripes of colors like a rainbow, the Rainbow Mountain. An alternate route is to go to Cusipata. From Cusipata, travellers may walk for 3km along Chillihuani route where along a bridle path to reach the Rainbow Mountain.The altitude of the Rainbow Mountain is around 5200 meters or over 17,000 feet, and acclimatization to the high altitude may be necessary for the trek up to the mountain.\n\n\n== Weather ==\nTravelers to Peru and locals generally agree that the best time of the year to visit the colorful site is in the month of August, since it is dry season and provides a beautiful view, maximizing the vivid colors of the mountains. Nevertheless, the famous colors always look aesthetically beautiful.\nTravelers are advised to try to avoid days following significant rainfall (namely in the months of December, January and February) and much more in times when snow has fallen. In terms of fauna, travelers are able to view a wide variety of alpacas and other camelids in certain short-term seasons.\n\n\n== Mineralogical composition ==\nAccording to the investigation of the Cultural Landscape Office of the Decentralization of the City of Cusco, the colorations of the mountain of the 7 colors are due to the mineralogical composition that it has: the pink color is for the red clay, fangolitas (mud) and arilitas (sand). The whitish colouring is because of the quartzose, sandstone and marls, rich in calcium carbonate. The red one made up of the claystones (iron) and clays belonging to the upper tertiary. The green is due to the compound of phyllites and clays rich in ferro magnesian. The earthy brown is a product of fanglomerate composed of rock with magnesium belonging to the Quaternary era. And the mustard yellow color for the calcareous sandstones rich in sulphurous minerals.\n\n\n== Mountain concession for mining ==\nThe mining approval process began on March 30, 2015 in Lima, when the mining exploration company Minquest Per\u00fa SAC, owned by the Canadian Camino Minerals Corporation, submitted a red beds mining petition to the Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute (Instituto Geol\u00f3gico Minero y Metal\u00fargico, INGEMMET). The petition included the territory of the districts of Cusipata and Pitumarca with an area of 400 hectares, covering the whole of the mountain, and also overlapping with the peasant communities of Chillihuani and Pampachiri. INGEMMET issued a warning that parts of this territory, including Vinicunca, should have been protected within the \"Ausangate Regional Conservation Area.\" In 2009, the Regional Government of Cusco had proposed the creation of this protected area to Peru's National Service of Protected Natural Areas (Servicio Nacional de \u00c1reas Naturales Protegidas, SERNANP). However, SERNANP responded that the Ausangate Regional Conservation Area had never been officially created, since the proposal had not met the necessary requirements. Therefore, on March 16, 2018 with Presidential Resolution No. 042-2018-INGEMMET / PCD / PM INGEMMET, the title of metallic mining concession was granted.On May 21, 2018, following public protests, the company informed the Regional Government of Cusco of its renunciation of the concession; however, the Regional Government indicated that it was the Ministry of Energy and Mines that must assume the administrative actions to recover possession of these lands. The National Chamber of Tourism (CANATUR) expressed its deep concern over the management of Vinicunca, one of the most important components of Peru's new appeal to tourism.   In November 2018, Peru's President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra issued a decree enforcing a 12-month ban on all mining activity in the area. The Regional Government stated its expectation that within that time frame, the Ministry of Energy and Mines would permanently register the region as a protected conservation area.   \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nApu (god)\nAusangate\nMineral industry of Peru\nTourism in Peru\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeology of the colors",

          "Breath taking view from the top. It\u2019s a fairly challenging trek to the top but surely well worth the effort. The last leg to the top is most challenging. I experienced hail storm on my way back which forced everyone to run down to their vehicles. Entire green valley turned white in a span of 15 mins",
          "(35:27) Do you not see that Allah sent down water from the sky with which We brought forth fruits of diverse hues? In the mountains there are white and red, of diverse hues, and pitchy black;",
          "Joined the tour after Xmas, lucky it\u2019s Sunny even weather forecast says 40% precipitation.\nTour bus: left my hotel at 6:30am and pick up other guys later. Total around 15 persons. I think this is low season so no need early pick up at \u2026",
          "Great view! Bit crowded. You should visit here if time allowed. The route is not so tough, but little bit hard due to altitude.",
          "Definitely a must do while in Peru. Beautiful view, thrilling experience. The cheapest way to do it is to take a bus to Cusipata, and then a taxi to rainbow mountain. Hike to the mountains was amazing, full of alpacas and great landscapes. \u2026",
          "Depending in the time you are going there, you can be lucky or not. If it is foggy and raining, I am sorry for you...\nIf it it sunny, then I am jealous  ;)\nIt is fun to see how the rainbow mountains are changing colors depending on the weather conditions. It is really super cold over there at 5k meters.",
          "Amazing location! U can book tour from Cusco .",
          "Depends what time of day you go can be bit crowded. However an awesome experience! It did rain and snow on us as we headed up the mountain, so take raincoat and good hiking boots.\nYou do have the options to hike up or take horses that leave \u2026",
          "Beautiful view from the the of mountain.\nEven it was cloudy, it was still nice.\nMake sure to keep yourself warm! It was really cold because of high attitude.\nThis rainbow montauban was discovered a few years ago due to global warming. Before that, it was just covered under the snow.\nI mean this is still comparatively new place!!",
          "it's quite the sight! but the path to get there lacked vegetation, the ground was loose, and the horses were really tired (just like us). still a good place to visit and if we were not with a tour group, I would have tried to take my time and keep walking instead of taking a horse.",
          "Awesome, make sure you bring rain coat, extra socks, T-shirt, small towel. It can rain or hail on you like it did to us.",
          "Well worth the tour! A tour leaving Cusco at 4:30 am costs around 50-60 soles. If you want to beat the crowds you can leave at 7am or 3:30 am. Lunch and breakfast are included. We left at 4:30 and found that the crowds were pretty mild, \u2026",
          "Bad weather ruined everything rrrr\n2019/7/25?\nBehold, the one and only \nSnowing and stormy Rainbow mountain \nIn JULY, which should be sunny and dry and colorful \nWell, it happened, and this is it.",
          "I had a hard time breathing and it's all up hill. I was amazed how the Peruvian people were able to run up and down that hill. Our tour guide, Roxanne, is the best!! She was patient and caring.",
          "One of the newest touristic attraction of the region - the place was discovered a few years ago. Right now you can get there with one of the tour organizer. Place is definitely worth seeing, especially really early in the morning when you miss the crowds.",
          "Beatiful place \n - you can buy a day tour at Cusco at around Plaza de Amas : Soles70/USD23 \n - tour start 07:00am , finish 18:00\n Cusco - Rainbown mountain take bus 4 hours\nAnd you have to walk 1.30hours",

          "I spent an amazing time and I will remember of Peru for all my life. The trip to Rainbow Mountain was amazing and such a good experience. Wasn\u2019t easy to get on top of mountain but worth any drop of sweat. That was my first coming in Peru but not last. Love you Peru \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea\u2764\ufe0f",
          "G\nAmazing views, great experience. The elevation could really get to you, and it gets cold. The hiking is not easy at all be prepare for a challenge. However, they do have options to take horses instead.",
          "I am doing a project for school on these amazing mountains, I was wondering if a guide or tourist would be able to tell me some more about them and about their experience. If you can PLEASE contact me at \n    annalisa.barrett@stu.shelby.kyschools.us         It would be a lot of help. Thank you.",
          "It is really beautiful place with great panoramic view, but it is quite popular, crowded and beware of altitude sickness (over 5000m). The trek can become very hard if you are not acclimatized. If you need, they can take you up or down on a \u2026",
          "Very beautiful view. Altitude is around 5200m. So, It is kind of cold and prepare for high altitude medical problem. I recommend to ride a horse when climbing.",
          "Very beautiful place. The hike is tough even for those who are in shape. 17000 ft of altitude ain't no joke let me tell ya. It was worth every bit of effort to get there. This should be added to your bucket list of places to see",
          "Rainbow mountain was a journey worth going to. But children and adults be warned, the high altitude takes a heavy toll on your body. Heavy headaches due to lack of oxygen and rapidly beating heart from climbing at high altitude.",
          "This place is impressive, it can be reached in several ways, we did it in 4-wheel motors along the eastern branch of the Andes, throught the Qosqopata town, that is locate 3 hours away from Cusco, which was an additional plus.\nIt is advisable to do it with some ecotourism company, since the area is independently it is a bit far",
          "It's an absolute stunning place. But I found it quite crowded, and it seems like a whole financing is behind this place. Its easiest to visit with a tour, which is such a shame, cause thereby every tour group visits the same place at the \u2026",
          "Amazing experience!!\nWe hired a tour that picked us up in our hotel in Cusco at 4.30am and finished the tour again in Cusco at 5pm.\n\nThe drive from Cusco is 2 hours until you get breakfast. Then an additional one hour drive, and finally the \u2026",
          "Beautiful place but do not go during rainy season, you wont see more than 2 colors and temperatures can change drastically in 2 seconds. This beautiful place needs to be admired during summer.",
          "Beautiful mountain a very challenging hike because of the altitude.  Try buying an oxygen canister in the city before going there, even if you have been fine in Cusco, it much different at this altitude. My wife got very sick just by being there, the oxygen would have helped.",
          "Amazing view! I really recommend to go there early morning. Choose a tour from Cusco around 3 am.  It's getting crowded at the top after 8 am.",
          "This was my first hiking tourist destination and the experience is both hard and beautiful because in the way to the mountains your physical and mental strength is tested but totally Worth it!!",
          "Great adventure for freaks of nature and mountain hiking",
          "Amazing place. It might take your breath away while walking to the top, due to the altitude, and it will definitely take your breath away with the sight from up there",
          "Absolutely stunning, though you have to be very lucky with the weather. During this time of year, this is considered rainy season and so it's most definitely going to be cloudy, in some cases even rainy or snowing. In my case it was snowing \u2026",
          "You need to be ready for this ascension. \n\nYou can pay for an horse to do the first part of the walk, but it\u2019s the easiest one because it\u2019s almost flat. \nI don\u2019t thinks it worth it because it\u2019s good to activate your body before starting the last and hardiest part.\n\nTotally worth it!\nTake some breaks and everything is gonna be alright.",
          "Please see my photos for unedited photos of the colors of Rainbow Mountain in December, the start of the rainy season! Everyone photoshops the colors, and you will not see a brightly colored mountain, but it\u2019s still beautiful! \n\nVisiting \u2026",
          "Amazing natural beauty.  Be advised about the high altitude difficulties and sudden change of weather. Do not visit on the first or second day in Cusco.",
          "Such a beautiful place. Beware it's not an easy hike. The altitude makes things a lot harder than they seen. However is incredibly worth it. The rainbow mountain is one of a kind in this altitude. If you manage to go up make sure you make your way to the Red Valley as to be quite honest it is as beautiful or more.",
          "Amazing place, the view at the top is fantastic. The altitude though is brutal, take your time, spend a few days in Cusco before to acclimatise. Horses are available but don't go all the way to the summit and cost 60 soles, recommend the challenge of walking the whole way.",
          "Best place",
          "It is so beautiful once you get there. It is an almost 2 hour walk to 17,000 feet above sea level. You should be prepared for altitude sickness symptoms.  If you feel you cannot walk up there,, you can rent horse back riding service offered \u2026",
          "Read many reviews saying that rainbow mountain was overrated and not as colorful as pictured, but I was not at all disappointed. The view was beautiful in all directions and the hike was not hard till the last 75 yards.",
          "This is a beautiful and interesting place to visit. A bit crowded with many tourists, but I found the site well managed and the trails well maintained.",
          "3.5 stars really because you can\u2019t come to Peru and not stop here BUT the hike is BRUTAL! Oxygen was being used after and the ambulance was there. The steep portion which comes after an hour of flat ground is difficult. Even good hikers \u2026",
          "Never seen such a beautiful colors like in this place\nI suggest to bring some heavy clothes and don't make my same mistake because up there is really windy and cold\nIn addition the hike to get to the top is quiet difficult and Intense but no worry if you think you can t make it for only 90 soles you can hire the horse for both ways",
          "The trekking to the top takes a lot of effort for those who are not used to high altitudes. I'd say it's a not a good idea for sedentary people - there's horses available but they don't go to the highest spot! \nAlso, depending at which time you get there, it will be absolutely filled with people disputing the best spots.",
          "It was a great photo op and small hike, made quite difficult by the elevation (5000+m) and the 3am departure from Cusco. At 6am there were not many other visitors but by 10 there were likely 1000. Go early for the best photos. I would do it again. I recommend Rainbow Mountain Travels as your guide and transportation.",
          "Worth the hike and the hype.  Last week the mountain was covered in snow. Careful what season you pick",
          "Amazing hike to see this splendid mountain and valley. Foggy as heck on the hike up, but when it cleared...wow. be prepared though. This altitude is no joke.",
          "Amazing colours. Yet by far not as colourful as in the color enhanced pictures, depending on the light and on the camera used. Or photoshop. And very busy. You are not really the only one there.",
          "great views",
          "Beautiful place, kinda hard to reach the top of the mountain but totally worth it.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking and worth the difficulty of the hike\u2019s elevation",
          "Although we've seen one colour only it was worth climbing up! Rare snow and mud event. Difficult to breathe at five thousand and one hundred metres. Bring climbing shoes-its obligatory!!! Ninety percent of the people did not make it up to \u2026",
          "Tough to breathe when climbing. Don\u2019t look at the top of the mountain as your target. Your target is after 5-6 steps, then a short break to catch your breath, then the next 5-6 step target.. and soon you are at the top. I am close to 68-year old.",
          "A bucket list item.\u2714 More beautiful than any pictures I've ever seen. \ud83d\ude0d A must visit. The altitude is insane but manageable.\ud83d\ude46",
          "Is not exactly as in the pictures on the internet, but, in my opinion, was much beautiful",
          "Amazing and wonderful mountain inthe world.",
          "This was probably my favorite adventure from our trip to Peru. It is not easy, but this is only due to it being so high up (16,500 ft at the top). You will most likely experience altitude sickness in some way or another. Hiking this was \u2026",
          "Beautiful beautiful beautiful! This place was absolutely gorgeous. However, I will say that if you are prone to altitude sickness DEFINITELY take it at your own pace or alternatively get a horse.\n\nThe trek is long but absolutely worth the \u2026",
          "Worth every single sweat, step and minute. The view is simply breathtaking",
          "Beautiful colorful mountain. Be prepared for hour & half of hiking in both ways. But it worth every single step. Try to visit it in the dry season (May-August) for better weather, so you will end up having snow & clouds like what is happened to me.",
          "5200 m pave sea level... you better be prepared for that. The road that leads to the big parking place where most tours start is about the scariest drive ever. No episode of Top Gear even comes close. The hike is t very long, but the \u2026",
          "Hike was more brutal than Machuu Picchu but definitely worth it. Make sure to take some Sol\u2019s to get your passport stamped as well. They have horses to take you up but still have to climb a little bit more",
          "Incredible climb and views. It was difficult but satisfying. Make sure you're acclimatized and bring some \"florida water\" with you to help with the altitude and breathing when needed. 100% would do this again.",
          "Worth climbing to view the scenic beauty of the mountain and glacier",
          "To me, an attraction equal to Machu Picchu. It's not only about the mountain, but also about the climb and natural surroundings. Must see.",
          "I used a horse to go both ways only 80 soles .but the last 500 meters is very very steep and has to be walked .it is very cold \nViews are amazing .at the top you can get your passport stamped for 2 soles primitive toilets are there  on the \u2026",
          "Unique view, best thing to see here in Per\u00fa.\nIt took 2 hours to get from the parking to the peak, take some pictures and back, with a rate of 30\u2019 per km (4 km total with a drop of 200 meters, from 5000 to 5200). It is not for everyone, \u2026",
          "3hr drive from Cusco to go up to 17k ft elevation. Def bring a lot of water as the high altitude will hit you at the top",
          "A very good trek in the nature. It wasn't too difficult in general but be prepared, the last section can be challenging, since you'll be at around 5000mt of altitude. The view you'll get once you'll be there will repay you full.",
          "Very beautiful mountain really fantastic",
          "We did the day trip and it was definitely one of the most stunning places I have been to. Highly recommend paying this a visit",
          "Wonderful place and a must do! You most likely get on a bus very early (4.30am) in Cusco and drive 1.5h to a place where you get breakfast. Then it's another hour to get to an encampment. From there you walk 2h or take a horse (60soles one \u2026",
          "There was a LOT of people, it kind of ruined the view. The dogs seen on top of the mountain were really friendly and cuddly. You have the opportunity of stamping your passport when you reach the viewpoint so dont forget it if that is \u2026",
          "The hike isn't very steep...only at the end. BUT the altitude is so high that it is definitely one of the most difficult hikes I've done. Take your time. Seriously. Walk slow. One step at a time. Even for the most fit hikers, it's a \u2026",
          "Good view. Be careful of high altitude",
          "This was a great experience but strongly recommend you acclimate in Cusco for a few days before going here. The altitude starts at above 14,000 and reaches almost 18,000 ft at the top. We took horses and opted out of doing the hike. Our \u2026",
          "Just amazing location ,When we did summit Vinicunca, the breathtaking views easily allowed us to forget about the 3-hour struggle we had left behind.",
          "Rainbow Mountain can be terrific, but when we visited it was 80% snow covered which limited rainbow effect. Expect crowds, but they are well organized.",
          "Amazing view! The mountains are incredible and powerful... It is worth starting the tour day at 3:00 am to be upper the mountain early in the morning and enjoy the landscape at 5,200 m (17,060 ft). It is fantastic the experience.",
          "We visited Rainbow Mountain using @Salkantaytrekking tours. Our guide was knowledgeable and encouraged our hike up the trail to the 5,000+ summit.\n\nMost of the trail there is streight, but there are two hills, one of them very steep that \u2026",
          "Long and hard walk. Better do it starting the week so that you don't encounter many visitors",
          "This place is so beautiful but at the same time is so hard to get there. Don't take the horses, go all the way with your own legs! In the end will be worthy!",
          "Incredible!! Magnificent views every turn, and a very challenging hike. Only 5km hike but starting at 4400m it can be very challenging. There are small stands selling chocolates, gloves/hats, and coca leaves along the way, as well as \u2026",
          "Amazing! Make sure to stop to catch your breath (elevation 5200 meters)",
          "Fantastic. A couple of steep parts but manageable unless you have a problem with the altitude...",
          "Amazing. I would rate it 5 stars, if motion sickness didn't get the best of me. The view was amazing, weather was all over the place. But the lady who helped guide the horse was constantly looking out for me and asking if I was doing alright even though she was the one travelling through mud and snow.",
          "The vivid colors on the internet are lies. The walk up that mountain will hurt you bad. I will never do that climb again. My whole family said the same....  The drive up and down are dangerous and beautiful at the same time. Almost forgot... make sure and try the cuy(Guinea pig). It was really good...",
          "Very rewarding once you reach the top. Ensure you bring shoes you don't mind getting muddy.",
          "It's beautiful, but you have to be aware of the hike. It is apparently not much, but due to the altitude it can get really tough. Being fit has nothing to do with it, the \"mal de altura\" can affect anyone. Just know it and enjoy the pretty unique view!",
          "Epic views. Difficult hike because of the altitude but definitely worth it. Come down slow or you may get a sick.",
          "If there's a bright side to the glaciers melting and global warming, then this is it!",
          "I had car sick, riding horse sick, and altitude sick but when I see the mountain everything is worthy.",
          "Reaching the top i's a tough challenge but once you make it to the summit you will definitely love the reward.",
          "Very beautiful place, I am 61 years old and it was challenging, but finally made it. You definitely have to get used for a couple of days or more to climb this mountain. Horses help, but you still have to climb about 200 mts to the top of the mountain on your own.",
          "Was a harder trip but wonderful, you need to have a training before to climb the mountain and good resistant, I recommend stay more than 2 days in Cusco first",
          "Incredibly beautiful, according to the story the mountain was discovered 5 years ago by European hikers, by chance as the glacier covering the mountain melted away due to global warming.",
          "Look for the decent weather and go there without any doubts. Amazing nature and beautiful Lamas there.",
          "It is really beautiful, but clearly very crowded. I would recommend going with one of the earliest tours departing at 3.30 to enjoy the view better. On top of this, I highly recommend stopping by the red valley on the way back, way less touristy and even more beautiful",
          "The climb was so worth it!!! It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Prepare well for the altitude but it is a must visit!",
          "Be prepared for massive headaches and no oxygen! The altitude packets online did not help. The views were definitely worth it. Would do it again anytime!",
          "The climb up is brutal but completely worth it, you will not regret it.",
          "I love rainbow mountans becuse their colorful\nAnd there are so many animal i love ciut animals\n\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude07\ud83e\udd17and who nows if there are gold inside",

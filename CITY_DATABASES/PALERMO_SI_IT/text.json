          "Sadly, we were not able to go inside the building,. due the lat of hours. But we could see, from the outside, and also, from the hop on hop off tour that we took, that it was magnificent. One should go to Palermo and see this through! I am most definitly going back to Sicily -",
          "To be honest wasn't really bothered about going here but was really impressed with the whole tour which was about 30minutes for 8 euros well worth it",
          "A beautiful theatre in Palermo - 3rd largest Opera house in Italy. It\u2019s being gradually renovated but is still in remarkable condition. There is a 30 min tour worth doing - 4 Euro pp. The guide was knowledgable and informative.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful theater! I was impressed, delighted! I had never seen an old theater from the inside and it\u2019s realy beautiful. If you have a half hour to spare, go for an inside tour.",
          "Interesting to get behind the scenes and into the auditorium of this beautiful interior. Well worth a visit",

          "The largest opera house of Italy, never restored so get the original glimpse before it starts. Large auditorium, nice spaces, retracting ceiling petals, elevating stage. Hard to fi tickets during our visit window so just toured the place. End with a cappuccino on the terrace.",
          "Teatro Massimo is reputedly the largest theater in Italy. However, it has wonderful acoustics and doesn\u2019t feel large when you\u2019re inside. My wife and I visited in December and saw an excellent performance of \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d which will long remember. Also memorable were the",
          "This building is so grand and beautiful! Apparently the third biggest historic theatre in Europe. I loved the fact that it looks quite different from every other theatre I saw around Europe. The size and the Magnificence of the building makes you realise this city had a glorious",
          "I went on the tour for the opera house, and it was terrible. For 8 Euros, they show you the main entrance, and then let you see the main opera house from both the main audience area, and where royalty sits. We also got to see a room where the men used to go and talk politics",
          "We visited Teatro Massimo to see My Fair Lady on Sunday 1 December. We had seats in the side tier on the 5th floor. The stage was to our right. Fortunately, our seats were two of three in the front row. Leaning forward & craning our necks we could just about see two-thirds of",
          "We saw My Fair Lady which was performed wonderfully. We sat in box seat on the side and had a hard time seeing our side of the stage. Try to get seats as near the middle as you can.",
          "As the largest opera house in Italy, Teatro Massimo is a wonderful venue to attend a Symphony. Purchasing tickets on line well in advance was also very easy. The acoustics are outstanding and there is not a bad seat in the house. Before visiting Palermo, check the calendar",

          "One of these remarkable baroque buildings of Palermo, huge. At one side there are some nice terraces on the square.",
          "A bit like the cathedral the Massimo is probably a bit more impressive from the outside. Interior pretty plain. Had a really good night as seats were a good price even though we went on opening night and the acoustics up in the gods were great. Had never heard of this oratorio",
          "A very special experience on our first trip to Sicily . We had gone to the opera in Milan and enjoyed and this was even better . We saw a performance of Verdi's La Traviatta The singing and music was superb ! We sat in one of the lower side boxes , met some friendly people from",
          "The theater is surely a nice building. We didn't go inside, but if you like architecture and history you will surely like it.",
          "This tour is just over 30 minutes, so enough time to bring you to 4 places within the building. Our tour was about 40 people and done in both Italian and English. There is some interesting history to learn, but the highlight for me was speaking in the center of a room I believe",
          "I won't say anything about the actual auditorium tour as it has all been said before. There are other tours that you can do (backstage for instance) but the lady who took us round said that it is only 25 euros or so to attend a performance in the top tier of boxes so if there",
          "Although the tour is short, for eight euros it is very complete. We usually visit the opera house in every major city and this is one of the best.",
          "This opera house/theatre is well worth a visit,an orchestra was practicing when we visited and we saw/heard them from the Royal box, some interesting facts and magnificent architecture.the echo room was amazing. Well worth \u20ac8 euros for adults and \u20ac5 for under 18s",
          "This was my first visit to an opera house in Europe.We were confidently advised this was the third biggest opera house in Europe behind Paris and Vienna.As a first timer this was pretty spectacular",

          "Only guided tour available. Fee Euro 8 pp. The interior was gloomy. The deco and murals were dull, the ceiling in hall was not decorated and in fact marked by large patches of water leaks from the roof. The theatre itself has nothing to shout about. There are much more better",

          "Unfortunately the waitress struggled with our order and was really slow with the bill. But food was OK and reasonably priced.",
          "You have to book a timed tour and you are then walked around different floors. We arrived and had to wait 15 minutes obviously there may be busier times. We enjoyed actually seeing some rehearsals taking place and being able to sit in the royal box. There are different ticket",
          "The show may have been good but with the tickets at 55 euros each, one can not see anything. It is a rip-off. They should have indicated so when we bought on line that there is no view. Just sit back and listen to the show. I could just have streamed the show instead.",
          "Had the opportunity to experience La Traviata in this beautiful renovated building. Unfortunately, the renovation only included air conditioning to the main floor. Those of us with tickets on the upper floor had to suffer the stagnant, humid heat. We couldn\u2019t finish the",
          "The reduced student price for the guided tour was well worth it to see the auditorium and other areas of the theatre. The 'backstage tour' was less extensive than others I've been on - but seeing the enormous stage behind the curtain is well worth it if, like us, you are a fan",
          "We went to take a tour and decided to buy tickets to the opera instead. Opera was great inside of theatre is beautiful but it would be better with ac as it was hot the night we were there.",
          "Fantastic tour around the theatre. Our guide was very good translating into English. Got to step in to the royal box and also had tour around the back of the stage and also went on the roof giving us a panaramic view of Palermo.",
          "Had an amazing tour of the Teatro Massimo. Purchased tickets in the morning and went on the tour. Wonderful to move around the theater and see from inside the main seating area, to an opportunity to see the private royal box. The sheer size and images make this a truly magical",

          "Very awesome place to visit. Huge place and a must see when in Sicily. Palermo may get a bad wrap st times, but with so much history and architecture, you will have an amazing time discovering it's storied past",
          "Guided bilingual Italian/English tour was a disaster. The guide memorised a text and was reproducing her text without any intonation nor personal touch. It is a beautiful building and we expected a lot more of it.",
          "for opera lovers, perhaps the thrill and joy of seeing a live performance and hearing the great acoustics will be worth the price, which as many have pointed out is not that high compared to comparable performances at other major theaters in the world - it is the largest theater",
          "My boyfriend and I paid for the full guided tour of the theatre and were really pleasantly surprised with how interesting it was. It was around 30\u20ac each and definitely worth the money. The tour guides informed us with all sorts of information and were very engaging. Our tour",
          "A huge complex that is worth seeing. Lots of space, takes up a city block with lots of public transportation nearby.",
          "Worth doing the tour if you are not able to see a performance. Book in advance if you would like to see something as we were unable to get tickets on the day. It is a beautiful building",

          "Impressive opera house, richly furnished with superb acoustics. The guide takes you inside, but for the price and the limited offering, it is very expensive.",
          "Fascinating building well worth visiting on a tour. Places Palermo in the wider arts context too. Costumes exhibit a pleasant way to end the tour.",
          "This is one of the most amazing theatres I have been to. The tour took just over half an hour - in both Italian + English. Would love to see a performance here",

          "We had hoped to catch a show while we were here and looked online for tickets. It appeared that the only option was a regular tour for the time we were in the area. I purchased tickets for a 5 pm English speaking tour not knowing what else we would have planned for the day. We",
          "Great spot to visit while in Palermo. You can do only tour visit of 30 min with guide - tour can be in Italian or English and they are taking you all around the Teatro. Price is very decent and worth of paying for the tour. If you are there when the Season is ongoing, it is",
          "Teatro Massimo is a Great pace to visit, but to be honest the tour tickets are far too high. There are two options to make it better than buying a ticket for the tour only. Buy a ticket to a show, you will see the same and have a great show for few additional Euros only. Or you",

          "Massimo Teatro is just packed with history, from the architectural side, to a popular movie, that was filmed on the steps. A full detailed tour which lasts half an hour, in english first, then she repeated everything in Italian, which gives you time to take photos, and not in",
          "We were recently in Palermo and toured Teatro Massimo. It is a beautiful concert hall and worth touring especially if you\u2019re not fortunate enough to hear a concert there. The tour was in both English and Italian. The hall has been beautifully restored after having been closed",
          "This is a Magnificent Opera House full of history. It is definitely worth the time to take the guided tour.",
          "The third biggest opera house in Europe. Unfortunately, at summer only works as a sight. With 8 Euro you can have an English and Italian speaking tour. The interior of the opera house is really enchanting and grand. You can also enjoy a coffee or an ice cream to the opera house",
          "The Teatro Massimo is the largest opera house in Italy with floor seating and is horseshoe shaped with 7 tiers of box seating (for 1000+ people). I sat in a 4th tier box and was extremely pleased with this seat. From my perspective, the more expensive floor seats would not have",
          "Quick but very interesting visit either in English or Italian If you don\u2019t have ticker for a show you will love seating at the most prestigious seats and learn about history",
          "This is expensive compared with similar tours but the trip to the roof 'terrace' and backstage was excellent. Beware that there is a ladder on the final stage of the trip to the roof, you need to be reasonably agile. However, the views over Palermo are well worth it.",
          "Today we visited the beautiful Teatro Massimo. Being interested in theatre we decided to do the backstage tour, which was a big disappointment. Lasting about 10 minutes we went behind the stage to see where some of the sets were stored (none there just some stacks of",

          "We did a guided tour which was informational but was split Italian and English. Felt we got half the tour. I have been on this tour before and learned and saw much more the first time.",
          "This tour was very nice. Nothing special. We were glad the guide spoke English. Worth your time but don\u2019t panic if you miss it.",
          "Really great theater. Easy to have a drink at the bar before a performance. As far as seating goes, the main floor level in our opinion isn\u2019t the best place to sit. About 2/3 of the main level cannot see the floor of the stage and the chairs were arranged so one sat right",
          "1800\u2019s architecture, impressive acoustics and viewing as well as comfortable box seating! Spectacular performance of Carmen with an outstanding orchestra! One can also take a tour of the building during most days.",

          "This place is a must see if you\u2019re interested in opera, the film - Godfather III or architecture. We took a guided tour which was worth the \u20ac8. We were able to see the private box, main stage and other areas of the building with full explanation.",
          "Advance ticket selection was confusing and turned out badly because the online seating diagram did not make clear the layout of the loges (seats 1-2-3 on the edge; 4-5 set back ... on uncomfortable \"barstool\" type chairs). Glare from the conductor's super-bright podium lights",

          "We paid the \u20ac20 for the full 1 hour tour rather than \u20ac8 for the 30 minute one, which we felt would\u2019ve been so-so. That doesn\u2019t distract from the MARVELOUS theater. We would\u2019ve just been left wanting more. And got it. Loved the back stage portion and the spectacular rooftop",
          "This is a beautiful theater! There is a bar & restaurant if you are so inclined which we were not. But we HAD to go to a performance. So, we lucked out that there was on that Friday night. It was a symphony. And it was amazing! Because we purchased tickets at the last minute,",

          "This is a nice and easy stop. The tour is quite short, thirty minutes or so, and is a bit uninspired, but sitting near the stage on the main floor and in the front row of the Royal Box (with plenty of time for pictures) made it worthwhile. All in this takes about 90 minutes,",
          "Other reviews have mentioned the size and (somewhat faded) beauty of this truly imposing building. I recommend the 30 minute guided tour, which gets you into the theater (there might even be some dancers practicing on stage) and even the royal box. Italian and English are",

          "This theatre is the third biggest in Europe. I suggest you take a guided tour that is run by well prepared guides speaking perfect english who give you in 30 minutes a great sense of this magnificent theatre. There is even the opportunity to relax in the royal box.",
          "The exterior is impressive with two statues on opposite sides high above the steps leading to the theater. It keeps with the character of a grand classical theater. I am sure it would be marvellous to watch a performance. Sadly, I did not have the opportunity as I was pressed",
          "This is a must when in Palermo . Do the whole tour as you don't want to miss the rooftop view. It was a fun experience and educational at the same time",
          "Teatro Massimo is probably the 2nd or 3rd largest theatre in Europe. You can get a guided tour of this place at a charge of Euro 8 per person. We took the english language tour which starts at 11:50 am. The sights are very impressive, as you go around the entire theatre. We",
          "Heart of a cheerful city. Brilliant and very active. Entrance is with a mandatory guided tour which is not always comfortable for the tourist. In fact the interior is very nice but the mandatory visit lasts only half an hour. In other great theaters in Italy you have all the",
          "A beautiful building and there are a lot of restaurants and bars nearby , crowded and busy at nights",
          "Always wanted to see the theatre after seeing the Godfather 111. It was even better than I imagined. Fantastic position in vibrant area. Sat on the steps watching endless people reenacting the final scenes from an iconic movie. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "A 30 minute tour is the only way to see this theatre. Available in both Italian and English (our guide did both). We were lucky to have an orchestra practicing during our visit, very good acoustics.",
          "This magnificent building is worth a trip inside. I enjoyed the different rooms behind the stage and the theatre ceiling. Our guide was good and had some interesting points to make and bits of history to share. The tour is short only a half hour and was 8 euros which is ok I",
          "All four of us loved the tour. Great opera house. Loved The Godfather movie connection. Inside is spectacular. Red velvet boxes. Beautiful woodwork and ironwork. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Too bad the city of Palermo is so dirty. Small trash everywhere,",
          "Palermo's Teatro Massimo is huge Nineteenth Century theatre. The guided tours are various. We went on the basic and back-stage tours. You have to book a specific time in advance. The guide was amusing and audible, fluent in Italian and English. The back-stage was good but we",
          "I'm a huge Godfather fan and that is the main reason I visited Palermo. In order to make my journey complete, I have to visit Theatro Massimo where the last scenes of The Godfather part 3 were shot. I urge you to take the full tour of the theatre which includes the inside of the",
          "Beautiful and quite impressive from architectural point, Palermo's neoclassical opera house is the largest in Italy and the second-largest in Europe. While visiting Palermo, the visit to this particular Opera House in Palermo is a must. It\u2019s a five store building that contains",
          "The Massimo is a beautiful old opera house boasting five floors and 1,358 red velvet seats. Awesome to look at, but the best way to experience its full elegance is to attend a play. Of course, that may not coincide with your Palermo holiday. But for those less fortunate who are",
          "We arrived for the first tour of the day as it's the only way to see the inside of this beautiful building. The tour guide spoke both Italian and English and was very informative. The Teatro Massimo is the third largest opera house in Europe but it's horseshoe shape made it feel",
          "Beautiful theatre that retains most of it's glory - unlike a lot of Palermo's attractions that are sadly well past their best. Unfortunately our tour was only a couple of days before a show so we could only see the opera floor and royal box and not the stage, that I understand",
          "We walked around and some inside, but we did not have a chance to see a concert in the hall. The acoustics are supposed to be phenomenal. The decorations were beautiful with an eclectic group of locals and tourists outside. The vendors lined the streets around the building",
          "We joined the \u20ac8 tour (each) which lasted 30 minutes and was given in Italian and then English. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions. We saw the starting room with the model created by the architect, main theatre, the royal box, the rehearsal",
          "A stunning functioning operahouse where the third Godfather was partially filmed. We went to watch Massenet's Werther and although the showing wasn't my favourite, the space and stage are truly spectacular.",
          "I had the opportunity to watch the rehearsal for Werther, so the whole theatre was at our (small group of people) disposal which made the experience even more unique. But the size and grandeur of the hall, ceilings, balconies, .. is something that one should not miss when in",
          "To see the French Opera, Werther, in the Teatro Massimo with English and Italian subtitles was the highlight of our trip to Palermo. The Opera house is a sight to behold and a must see. If you have the opportunity to see an Opera, do so! You will not be disappointed.",
          "Teatro Massimo is the opera house that is featured in Godfather III and is a truly imposing building very well located in Palermo. We were lucky to be there when there was -- of all things - a Beatles Marathon -- and were lucky as well to be able to take a full tour of this",
          "Visiting the Opera House in Palermo is a must, especially if one is interested in theater, music and operas, as well as architecture. The full tour is worth the visit. It includes all parts of the opera, backstage, and finally the top from where you can have a look at the city",
          "This accommodation is ten minutes from Palermo Cathedral, Musium and hop on bus 22Euros for two days, staying 12nights \u00a3594 plus 6 Euros local tax , good breakfast, clean, roof top terrace. It is basic but would come again.",
          "Took the tour, the guide is very knowledgeable and not boring. Loved the interiors of this place. It's so beautiful and transports you to a time when theaters were so popular. It'll make you wish you could watch a show there. and if you have time to do that you really should.",
          "This theatre is a classic example of remarkable architecture in Palermo. It located in the epicentre of a captivating area of the city, certainly more interesting than the approach form the airport. The theatre is superb. Classic detail and seating booths. A beautiful",
          "We were on a Mediterranean cruise, arrived in Palermo and took a taxi van for 9 persons for a total cost of \u20ac162. The taxi driver drove us for more than 3 hours along many interesting places around Palermo, one of them being Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele. This is the largest",
          "This was a very decent tour. First of all, it is the largest opera house in Italy and the 3rd largest in Europe. The artistry, and attention to detail, outside and especially inside the building, is superb! Our guide was very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions. We",
          "Tour was alright and the guide had a decent level of english. For what I payed I would say it was extremely short, it lasted 30 minutes at the most. We bought the tickets and we were told that our tour would start at 16:00, we went there at 15:55. And the tour didn't start",
          "We spent a wonderful evening seeing Mahler's Resurrection. A beautiful venue, one of the largest opera houses in Europe. Great music, orchestra and chorus. Fun to see everyone dressed up. Didn't matter that we were in tourist clothes.",
          "This is a beautiful theatre but although the tour was relatively inexpensive it was decidedly too short. Barely 3 or 4 minutes were allowed on the floor of the great hall, 5 looking at the model in the foyer and another 5 in the Pompeian echo Hall do not do it justice. No",
          "Really beautiful peace of art. When we were there it was closed but even just from outside it looked really beautiful.",
          "What a nice place to enjoy a concert. We witnessed a Rachmaninov 2 piano concert although we are not experienced piano concert visitors. The acoustic is really fantastic and the place is beautifull.",
          "The tour of the opera house is much like many others, intro, foyer, auditorium & Royal Box. Back stage is a bit more interesting; you get onto the fore stage & look out then into the guts of the back stage. Huge. Probably better value than the first part. Much fewer people, too.",
          "This Opera house is the largest in Italy and third largest in Europe. It is really cheap to go on a quick half hour tour around but if you are more keen on seeing it in details then there are other tours available. The seating area is beautiful and you can even book seats in the",
          "Third largest in Europe, numero uno in Italy, Teatro Massimo is grand and opulent. Take the tour but stay for a drink at the patio caffe, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Loved theater massing and the incredible ballet. Seats in 12th row are excellent. Perfectly executed performance. A fun afternoon for adults as well as children.",
          "We only were outside and it was so busy with people sitting around and chatting etc. Lots of streets off the main piazza with restaurants and the puppet theatre is along the street where we had lunch. Also of more interest than the theatre is the archaeological museum which is",
          "My wife and I were fortunate enough to hear the orchestra rehearse for an upcoming performance, and truly I can attest that the acoustics in Teatro Massimo are perfect! One caution in regard to the rooftop tour of Teatro Massimo-- you will be climbing up and down a rather",
          "I grew up as a dancer - I absolutely LOVE theaters and this one did not disappoint. The tour was very informative. I would have loved to do all of the tours but some were only available during certain times.",
          "We enjoyed this performance more than any we have seen. The orchestra and the singers were perfect. Well, maybe the young tenor was a little wooden but his voice made up for it. Amazing acoustics in this big hall.",
          "We came for a performance of La Traviata and were blown by the performance, the set, the acoustics and the atmosphere. Wholeheartedly recommend the Teatro to anyone. We took in the guided tour earlier and were very impressed with the whole location.",
          "This building is a piece of Sicilian history. Beautiful architecture. Very impressive, both externally and internally. A 30 minute guided tour, gives you a taste of what it would be like to experience a performance. The day I visited there were rehearsals going on in the",
          "Desperate to see anything here and the internet promised a short modern ballet visiting here was the first thing we did to secure tickets. Sadly no e available during our visit fully booked. Great news for the theatre. The building dominated the local landscape and the facade is",
          "We visited the Teatro Massimo in April 2016, and saw a performance of Rossini's La Cenerentola. We love Rossini, and despite the very modern staging using a chorus with iPads and green screen projection, the performance was great. The entire cast gave their best, and it was a",
          "We seemed to pass the Teatro Massimo quite a few times during our 3 day stay in Palermo. It's a very impressive building from the outside and we decided to take the basic inside tour which cost 8 Euro's. Tour was only about 30 minutes long but worth doing as the decoration is",
          "8 Euros for a 30 minute touring of the interior was not the best value unless one was a theater/ opera fan. The guide hurried the group along to keep to the 30 minutes schedule. The admission was 20 Euros if the roof terrace was included. Yes, it is the third biggest opera house",
          "Worth spending a few moments inside, outside and on top of it! Being the 3rd biggest opera house in Europe sure has a lot to show and say. Arrange the terrace view/tour.",
          "We were advised that the Teatro Massimo was better than the Politeamo. We went on a 20-25 minute guided tour which allowed us to see places and access area only a guided tour would allow. We saw the actual theatre, sat in the VIP box and even had a glimpse of some ballerinas",
          "Apart from viewing the interior do book an opera to attend while visiting Palermo... It is in the centre of the city right on the pedestrian way and within the area of a multitude of restaurants and cafes \ud83c\udf70\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf7e",
          "The tour is 5 euros and worth taking. Good quality narrative. This is the 3rd largest in Europe behind Paris and Vienna, but not anywhere near as impressive or beautiful. Hence, the rating of 3. If felt run down and very average versus others even beyond Vienna and Paris.",
          "I could not have watching any performance there but I took a guide tour. Where is third biggest opera house in Europa.It does not take long time but it is enough to understand general condition.Especially presedent part of teatre is very large and different comparing with",
          "Great architecture coupled with central place in the city. Folks were preparing it for concert. Interesting sense of witnessing such a beautiful place for music.",
          "Great building. Sadly I feel tour guide was under stimulated to be really bothered to tour just my partner and I. Which I understand as in January it must get boring offering the cheapest tour only as not many guests. Let me be clear tour guide was good, tour on offer was not.",
          "The structure os very pretty and if you visit the center of the city you will pass by it many times.",
          "Took a basic tour, without the rooftop access. Informative and interesting and not terribly long, took about 30-40 min. Made us want to come back to see a performance.",
          "I wasn't able to make a tour on the inside of the theater, however, the outside can only be described as majestic. A huge building with beautiful architecture and decorative works, that becomes even more interesting with the Christmas decorations. It is impossible to miss when",
          "Go to the opera! One of the most beautiful theaters in the world! The chorus is remarkable a magical experience",
          "We joined the guided tour in english and italian. The space was spectacular. Biggest theater in italy. 3rd biggest in europe. We even manage to see the rehearsal for the nutcracker.",
          "In great shape this cultural icon in Palermo offers bets Opera, Music events, and also the Messias in Christmas time. Great location and superb architecture. Do not miss to spend one night of worldwide class cultural events.",
          "This is the largest opera house in the whole of Italy, and well worth visiting. The architecture and the interior is absolutely stunning. A guided tour is available.",
          "My wife and I spent approx 40 mins on a tour within the theatre (8\u20ac each) which is usually managed in small groups.It is magnificent on the outside and just decent inside where it needs a significant refresh.Old world experience is still there btw.Sometimes queues out of the",
          "If you are a fan of music, theaters ,it' s a must see in Palermo. The interiors of the theater are impressive. We took a half an hour paid tour inside the theater and it was worth seeing it. It's only a pity that the tour was so short and inside the theater was crowded with kids",
          "We were only able to see the exterior at the interior was closed for a private event :( Lovely architecture.",
          "Took this brief (45min) tour on a Sunday morning, so the group was small with lots of time for questions. The Grand Hall is beautifully decorated, oozing maximum Old World charm! Several musicians were rehearsing during our time there which added to the overall experience. Our",
          "Saw \"JANUFA\" opera which one has to admit was a little bizarre in that (I think) it is either a Hungarian or Iranian (sung) opera. My wife thought Iranian. I thought Hungarian, but theatre was hot do didn't read synopsis with care sorry. So one had the odd experience of opera",
          "The theatre is easily accessible via public transport and located in beautiful surroundings. A majestic building from the outside and even better once you get in! As we are not native Italian speakers we chose to see a play intended for kids, and paid only \u20ac5 on the door without",
          "This is one of the most important opera houses in Italy, and one of the largest. You may not be able to afford la Scala or one of the mainland opera theatres, but tickets for the Teatro Massimo won't break the budget. The interior decor is pure Italian nineteenth century and the",
          "The guided tour was excellent and the theatre is magnificent. The ceiling is unique in that the panes can open for ventilation, yet they are a work of art. Don't miss an opportunity to see this third largest opera house in Europe. It was especially interesting seeing the",
          "The theatre is absolutely stunning inside and out. It is worth a visit just to appreciate its beauty. However, as an opera novice I decided I wanted to go and watch an opera and what a perfect venue for my first experience. The opera was 'Janacek's Jenufa' and it was beautiful,",
          "We went on the basic guided tour of the theatre - very interesting to hear about the history of the place as well as see such a lovely interior while empty. Our guide was also helpful and answered questions from the group. Definitely not worth missing out on and can see why it's",
          "The Teatro Massimo is Palermo's opera house. It is magnificent on the outside and just as nice inside. Well located, within walking distance of everything.",
          "I had booked to see the opera whilst I was here and as I went to pick up my tickets I went on the tour of the opera house. Although it was short it was great to see the rooms you would not be able to visit if you was going to watch a performance. There is one circular room",
          "We took the \u20ac8 Euro your which was taken by and enthusiastic guide and lasted about 30 mins. The tour was in Italian and English. You don't get to see loads of the building but what you do see is interesting and the guide spoke knowledgeable about each part. You go to the main",

          "In the centre of a very busy shopping area, this is a stunner. Visited during an evening at a nearby restaurant it looks wonderful at night so went back the following day to do the short tour.Very short !! No chance for a photo opp on the steps leading from the opera house as",
          "For \u20ac8 we took a tour of this amazing building. Other than seeing a performance this is the only way to see the opera house. The tour was very disappointing, they allowed too many people (50+), the guide was unenthusiastic, told nothing of what must be a wonderful history of the",
          "Took in a 30 minute guided tour. A bit of history and features of the building, and a walk through. The building is still in use today. Interesting but not exciting.",
          "Take the guided tour unless you are fortnate and attending an opera. Just breathtaking. Very easy to access now tha Via Macqueda is pededtrian friendly",
          "We only had a short amount of time to visit the city. We saw Teatro Massimo from our tour on the Hop On/Off bus. We knew we had to go inside. We wanted to go on the rooftop tour but it was too late in the day and it wasn't available until the following morning. But we were able",
          "We were not able to see a performance, but took an English tour which we booked on the spot. The tour was excellent and the theatre wonderful. Moreover, we were lucky enough to be there while they were rehearsing for an opera \u2013 no sets or clothes, but just the four singers",
          "We had tickets for a performance at Teatro Massimo on 29th September 2016 and decided to take a tour of the theatre. We took both the auditorium tour and the backstage tour. I would recommend doing both. It's a fabulous theatre and if you're a fan of the Godfather you'll enjoy",
          "We booked two tickets three days before the performance at the end of September by Orchestra del Teatro Massimo of Shostakovich's Leningrad This was the only performance on during the four nights we were in Palermo. While there were no stall seats there were some front row",
          "What a beautiful city and place to see. This is amazing love coming here and seeing this building with so much history, culture for us to enjoy!",
          "Teatro Massimo is a \"must see\" in Palermo; Sofia Coppola \"died\" on its steps during the filming of The Godfather. We were on a private tour, and sat in the auditorium as well as the Royal Box. It is fun to play with the \"perfect acoustics\" at the center of the rotunda.",
          "I attended the opening performance of Madame Butterfly in Palermo's Teatro Massimo on September 16, 2016. I read all the reviews of the theater that I could find and the ones on TripAdvisor were very helpful. Buying online was bit confusing and since there were seats left, we",
          "I love opera, and this one was long on my list. Having booked tickets online (easy enough), I picked them up at the shop on the day of the performance, put on the little black dress and went to my seat. Everyone is dressed up, which is nice, and the auditorium (which is huge!)",
          "As the title suggest, the Theater (their opera and balet) is massive. It is just the beautiful to look at. Around, there are many shops and bars. I recommend going on a tour of the inside.",
          "I missed the chance to see a performance at this beautiful theatre but the basic tours is well run and informative. Good price and they have a lot of extra tours available such as the back stage and terrace tour so you can really have a a thorough day trip.",
          "We were strolling through the neighborhood near our hotel and came upon this building without knowing what it was. On the north side there is a large area with steps where folks were resting. It's a great place for a photo op. The building was closed so we did not go inside.",
          "We arrived in Palermo after a hell of a ride. The first thing we encountered was Il Teatro Massimo. We entered the place where you have to buy biglietta's. The person behind the desk was playing with his computer and showed no interest at all for us tourist and only when I",
          "What a beautiful opera house this is. We were sat in the stalls and the seats are very comfortable with enough legroom for even my tall husband. We were astonished however at the behaviour of the audience. People were constantly talking and looking at their (lit up) phones which",
          "I strongly recommend visiting the opera house and investing in a guided tour. The guide (English speaking) was excellent, not too much cultural information. We were lucky enough to be able to sit at the back of the theatre during rehearsals of Madam Butterfly - amazing! We had",
          "Great building. Sadly, they were no performances on during our stay but take the tour and find out all about this lovely building ... and make sure you visit the roof top for the most impressive panorama of the entire city! Not to be missed!",
          "It was new information for me that Palermo is located in the third largest opera house in Europe. The building is impressive, and about a 40-minute tour of the building took us through box-seats to the parrante floor. Tour is inclusive and we got lucky to watch the ballet",
          "I viewed the theatre after paying \u20ac8 euros for a guided tour conducted in both Italian and English. The tour took approximately 45 minutes and was both interesting and enjoyable. We got to see the view from the Royal Box, a rehearsal space and the echo room. You can't see any of",
          "A short but informative tour, friendly, funny guide in English. You have to do it once. Don't forget you can sit in the Royal box, where a scene from the Godfather part3 was filmed and test your voice with the amazing acoustic sounds in the echo room.",
          "Very interesting tour by charming Italian/English speaking tour guide - definitely worth the money. Would also highly recommend lunch in the alfresco theatre restaurant - excellent value for money. You don't actually have to take the tour to eat in the restaurant which can be",
          "Our family took the English guided tour and really enjoyed seeing the inside of this beautiful theatre. No performances in the Summer, but they host opera and ballet from September to June. Other languages offered and the cost was \u20ac8 per adult, \u20ac5 for children. Very popular",
          "Teatro Massimo is an imposing big structure right in the center of Palermo. It is the biggest theater in Italy and the third in Europe. It has a very beautiful neoclassical facade, with two lions and a staircase on the main entrance facing a nice piazza which is full of people",
          "It is the biggest opera house in Italy, and 2nd biggest in Europe. Built in a beautiful neoclassical style. You can join a 30 minutes guided tour inside. Tourists like to visit here as it was filmed in the \"The Godfather\" movie.",
          "This theater is one of the most impressive in Palermo and looks beautiful from the outside. The lion statues outside the entrance are impressive.",
          "Beautiful from the outside and imposing, this building is at the center of Palermo and not to be missed. The guided tour only lasts 30 minutes and will explain the history and architecture of the place which is relatively new for Palermo built in 1861.",
          "This is a magnificent theatre full of history and a pleasure to visit. They have guided tours, which last for only 30 minutes, but they are well worth it!",
          "The teatro, is of course one of the main tourist attractions in Palermo. It is beautiful and amazing, but the guided tour was okay. They really could add quite a bit more to the tour. We tried to do a self-guided tour, but we couldn't because the orchestra was practicing. The",

          "The tour took about 30-35 minutes and ticked all the boxes. The theatre is beautiful and the tour takes you through the various foyers, interval areas, the main theatre and also into the Royal Box. The tour continues through other interesting areas like the domed echo room.",
          "Probably the most pretty building in palermo, the only one with decent maintenance on the outside. on the piazza guisepe verdi , nice place with small terrace and iceshops.",
          "We decided to take in a show rather than the tour - we often make this choice in places we visit as we feel it gives a more rounded experience. The show we saw was poor. The layout of the teatro does not lend itself well to viewing - surely the main point! Nice decoration in the",
          "Of course it is worthwhile to see inside, but to call this a guided tour is a complete misnomer. The guide added nothing at all. There was only very scant information, nothing about the history pr architecture or events and people who had been in the building. Very",
          "Do the guided tour for about 8 euros each. The theatre is beautiful to look around, we saw the orchestra rehearsing and ballet dancers warming up. You also get to go in the Royal Box where the top price ticket is only 100 euros, making London's West End ludicrously expensive.",
          "As we learned, this is third biggest active Teatro in Europe, unfortunately been able to admire it only from exterior, haven't had a chance for going inside.",

          "Beautiful theatre in the heart of the old section of Palermo. Take the tour of the inside as it is just as impressive as the exterior.",
          "I wanted to go in/see a show, but time prohibited it - loved the outside of the building and I look forward to going inside the next time I'm back in Palermo. The square outside/surrounding streets appeared to be the main social hub of the city...",
          "We visited the theatre with combined English and Italian tour. Was supposed to be English only, but not disturbing. Beautiful place. Just one point. Wanted to go to toilet at the end. They do not allow for that unless you drink something. Came across very unfriendly.",
          "The third largest theatre in Europe and very definitely grand, the only downside of the visit was that your eight euros only buys you about half an hour of strictly guided tour - no loiter time allowed.",
          "Went to see an Opera by Philip Glass and was not disappointed. we went for pre show drinks in the bar downstairs and the service was excellent. waiting staff were very attentive.",
          "I read other reviews and, while I agree with the beauty of the theatre, the amazing details, the privilege of walking into the king's suite, I find that 8\u20ac for a 25-minute tour where the guide basically speaks for 5 minutes (the rest being free time and walking about) is",
          "While in Palermo with a tour arranged by our friends from Lincoln, Nebraska, who own and run Italiano for You (Italianoforyou.com) we had a guided tour of the Teatro Massimo, a magnificent structure that houses a beautiful theater. The day we were there, the troupe was",

          "This is probably one of the more 'expensive' attractions in Palermo (at 8 Euros) but thoroughly worth it. We were lucky to arrive on a quiet day and had a small tour of four people. The tour guides are knowledgeable and friendly and allow you time to take photos. Lots of",
          "A must see establishment for art lovers. The architecture, history, and the atmosphere in downtown Palermo makes it a definite stop on your itinerary. There is this amazing stutue of Verdi in front which makes it even more alluring for opera lovers.",
          "Great experience as there were practice ballet and orchestra playing American Jazz sessions and our group had a grid Teatro guide.",

          "The Palazzo dei Normanni, situated in Piazza Indipendenza, just near the Porta Nuova, is an architectural symbol of Sicily itself. The building you see before you goes back to the Arab conquest but the foundations go back to the Phoenicians of the 8th to 5th centuries BC and",
          "This place is where you truly want the walls to talk. Amazing mixture of Moorish and Norman styles living happily together. A must see. As most things in Palermo.",
          "On a warm Feb afternoon we visited this lovely Palace and museum. The staff were helpful, spoke good English and were unobtrusive throughout. It is ideally located minutes off of the main market and Square, up a street with museums, gardens and restaurants. The exhibits were",
          "The chapel, covered in beautiful mosaics, is the main attraction. That is worth the two stars. Almost everything else is not worth walking through. On the main floor are some exhibits about the history of the Normans in Sicily and Southern Italy which is mildly interesting.",
          "The Norman Palace was long the centre of power in Sicily and, as the name indicates, is closely associated with the Normans who ruled Sicily for about 100 years from the late 11th century. It is somewhat austere and fortress-like outside but it is massive and inside has much",
          "Stunning doesn't even begin to describe how beautiful this massive Palace is! I took so so many photos, there are tours and I recommend you take one. Best to go early so the cue isn't too long, I walked right in, but the velvet ropes lead you to believe this is one busy place.",
          "Great castle to walk round. We went as part of the hop of hop off tour. Admission is fairly reasonable.",
          "I thought it would be just another palace/castle... And then I entered the Palatine Chapel... I was speechless... So beautiful!",
          "Generally this is good, but the Chapel is absolutely superb. Not far out of the centre and easily walkable - call in at the Cathedral on the way up",
          "The true highlight of my visit to the Royal Palace : the Capella Palatina .You have to see to understand how beautiful it is ! I was impressed by the work of the restorers, there were 2 teams who worked so patiently! I was also impressed by the Sicilian Parliament Hall - an",
          "Don\u2019t miss it. Never seen such a magnificent, well preserved Byzantine mosaics. To say the atmosphere in the Chapel is magical is just an understatement!!! Unfortunately the magic was interrupted because we had to change the audio guide in the middle of the visit due to low",
          "My wife and went to the Norman Palace on a small group tour (11 of us) with a private guide, Francesca. Based upon the lines we saw when we arrived this is the best way to visit. Our Guide got the tickets immediately and we walked right in with no wait. Having Francesca really",
          "It\u2019s an avoidable destination. The amount of ticket does not justify the visit. Most of the palace rooms were closed. The garden is a joke except few old trees. See it from outside and that would be enough.",
          "The palace hosts the local parliament and expect security check. Book tickets for the gardens as the office is not advising. Well preserved place, ample, monumental. The chapel is purely wow! The special exhibition very interesting and the royal apartments very chic with a nice",
          "One of the worst organizers I have seen, buy the ticket not on site but somewhere else, no toilet, found a toilet but works only with 50 cent, paid full ticket but was told second floor is closed (for no reason without even mentioning anywhere), and no proper description in",
          "Well worth the visit, the chapel was beautiful and the rooms were outstanding, very well preserved considering the age of the Palace. the staircase in marble you can just imagine the people who have walked down them in there beautiful cloths. The horse drawn carriage has been",
          "I did not regret visiting the Norman Palace since it is one of the oldest royal housings in Europe. The outside is beautiful and big. Getting inside was a challenge since they have closed the main entrance (or at least the entrance that google showed us!). Most of the rooms of",
          "We walk a lot to get here and it is worth it. the mosaics are fabulous. We did not spend a lot of time here because it was near closing.",

          "Once the bunch of garrulous Italian women in front of the ticket office had dispersed I bought our tickets (\u20ac15 each) for the Cappella Palatina, Castrum Superius Royal Apartments and the Royal Gardens (an extra \u20ac4 that we didn't find out until later and had to go out and buy",
          "Photos do not do justice to the magnificent mosaics in the Chapel. The craftsmanship and artistry is astonishing as are the stories depicted in the multiple scenes. I was part of a small group touring Sicily, and we had a private guide who explained a lot about the chapel when",
          "We went to see the palace on a day when we could not see the royal apartments - if you cant see those, it probably isnt worth the visit. The garden is truly disappointing and I can see from other people's pictures that the apartments are really the best part.",
          "Individual rooms are aesthetically or historically interesting, The courtyard is especially nice. The parliament that meets here is one of the oldest in Europe. Other public rooms reflect a succession of periods. In fact, the most interesting thing about the Palace is its age",
          "The Royal Palace of Palermo, aka the Norman Palace, was the seat of the Kings of Sicily. There is a Medieval exterior. Although improvement and restoration has happened throughout the centuries. Any visitor must see the Palatine Chapel and the Royal Apartments. The regional",
          "I missed this place on two previous visits, it was closed for government functions, what else is new. Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, all came, built the Palace and left. Then, the Normans embellished it in the 12th & 13th Centuries and the Spanish added the grand facade in the",
          "Awesome museum, many in one in actual fact, take a ticket that allows you to visit everything, the royal rooms, the norman part, the sala dei leoni, it is all beautiful.",
          "Well worth a visit. Can\u2019t comment on the royal apartments as they are closed during the week. Loved the museum as it gave a really good over view of the Norman\u2019s In Sicily. The chapel was every thing you would expect from a royal chapel. The gardens at front of palace are a good",
          "Place was interesting, highlight was the cappella palatina, simply stunning, fabulous. Didn't buy the right ticket so couldnt go in some rooms which was very annoying. Not sure why you would need separate tickets for different rooms!",
          "Arrive early as they stop selling tickets quite a time before the venue closes. As it isn't open everyday, the queues can be long. Make sure you find out that a comprehensive ticket covers what you want to see. We had the staterooms included, but trying to get into the King",
          "My main reason for visiting Palermo the Chapel is even more spectacular than the photo's suggest. Although quite small the wealth of detail is superb - every inch is a jewel. To get an idea see the internet but it is only an idea - in the flesh it is breathtaking. Entrance \u20ac",
          "I didn't bother with the full visit. Just focused on the Capella Palatina which is enough, to be honest, because every inch is covered in lavish Byzantine mosaics illustrating biblical scenes. There's also plenty of Arabic influence, particularly in the geometric patterning of",
          "It is well worth visiting the Palace just to see the fabulous gilded mosaics that cover almost all of the interior of the Chapel. It isn't as large as Monreale Cathedral, but the effect is far more intense. The exhibition explaining the history of Palermo and the Palace is well",
          "The Royal Palace (Norman Palace or Plazzo del Normanni in Italian), as the name suggests, dates from Roman times and was one of the highlights of our visit to Rome. It has to some extent been the seat of power in Palermo from Norman times through to the modern day and is",
          "Step back into history and relish the architecture of the Norman Palace. Take your time as you walk through the different halls and imagine what life was like. The only draw back for me was the the large groups of \"tours\" The groups would block the doorways not allowing other",
          "Paid 17euro to see everything there was, but found it very expensive comparing with other attractions on Sicily. The garden is small and there is nothing to see- I do not recommend paying for the ticket to see it - there are better and nicer parks in Palermo that this garden.",
          "Byzantine at its best. We had no idea how special this chapel was. It is virtually impossible to describe. This amazing blend of east meets west is at its finest.",
          "Absolutely fascinating and must not be missed. The palace is of Arab-Norman architecture representing a blend of cultural and political power. It became the residence of Norman kings. The Palatine Chapel is unique and breathtaking! There are many visitors but the building",
          "We saved the last day to visit the Royal Palace. We really did not need to save that long. We paid 17\u20ac each for entry and the audio guide. We got to see a courtyard and the amazing chapel ( which is the highlight) and the palace gardens ( big disappointment) and then a small",
          "While unassuming from the outside, the Normal Palace, especially the Palatine chappel, is truly an artistic and historic wonder, not something to be missed.",
          "We LOVED the church, its a gorgeous bizantine art, the pictures talk to itself, 10 Euros, but i was VERY disappointed the \u201cGiargino Reale\u201d, a 2 Euros plus ticket for just a small garden with NO flowers, even a single flower, and just 2 big trees (without any identification) and",
          "The ticket for the Capella Normanni also lets you see the rest of the palace although on several days a week entry is restricted to just a few rooms because it is a working government building. After the chapel everything else is a bit of an anti climax although pleasant enough.",
          "Walked a long way to get here, massive queue for tickets, massive queue to get in - bag check - security scanner then got stuck behind hoards of walking tours, another long wait to get in the church, was to full to get photos, were getting fed up at this point. would not like to",
          "Tickets for each area of the palace are bought separately, but we were thrilled to find that it is all free for students of historical or artistic subjects! The interiors are incredible - mixture of classical european styles and arab mosaics. The chapel (closed on Sunday morning",
          "Unless you are trying to visit so you can say you were at a world heritage site I wouldn\u2019t waste your money! We went on a Tuesday morning cost was $34 euro\u2019s which included the audio guide. The apartments were closed, only open on weekends so basically it was a tour of chapel",
          "We arrived around 3pm and there was no queue to buy tickets or visit the chapel by then. We requested the inclusive ticket (including the upper apartments, which are closed Tue/Wed/Thu) but then found the mosaic room there had not been included (extra 8 euros which could not be",
          "We arrived at the palace at 10.15 am but entry to The Capella palatina was not allowed until 11.30 am. Worst still, you have to queue up for more than 20 mins in order to gain entry. While we were forced by our bnb host to pick up our bags at 12, we could only spend 5 mins in",
          "1. Yes, it is a marvel. It\u2019s UNESCO world heritage site status is very well deserved, for its combination of styles. 2. Ticket buying is a challenge! Ticket titles (what is printed in the ticket) do not correspond to what you actually can visit. The \u201cintegrated\u201d ticket states",
          "We visited the Norman Palace mainly because of our interest in seeing the chapel within it's walls. The Palace was interesting to see also but we didn't have much time to visit the palace in general because we focused on the chapel. The chapel is a must see, with the mosaics",
          "From my understanding, the exhibition is not available on certain days, making the ticket price 2euros cheaper. If you can arrange it, I highly recommend seeing the exhibition because the explanations and context are well organized. There is information the Normans, including",
          "The Norman Palace has a very insightful exhibition into the history of Sicily. The exhibition is full of artefacts and full of informatio,(in Italian and English). The Royal apartments were closed so we didn't get to see these- perhaps money should have been taken off the ticket",
          "A magnificently decorated, beautiful church with over the top mosaics covering most of the walls and ceilings. Must see in Palermo.",
          "I don't know who was paying extra for things (see other reviews). We paid the normal price and saw the whole thing. One thing that did make me sad is that the chairs in the chapel were roped off, so you couldn't actually sit and absorb the magnificence of the murals. Absolutely",
          "The Palazzo Reale dei Normanni is the location of the Cappella Palatina and as such it is a must-visit site when in Palermo. Besides the superb Cappella, the Palace includes the small but splendid Sala di re Ruggiero also from Norman times. Its many other rooms are less",
          "Royal apartments were closed so disappointed. I prefer to wander through such places instead of shuffling through exhibitions about them, regardless of the background they provide. In a crowded situation it\u2019s hard to absorb much.",
          "If you go, beware that this place charges you extra tickets for every little thing. The chapel (which was magnificent and worthwhile) and royal apartment is one ticket. The special collection is one ticket. The \u201cnew\u201d exhibit inside the royal apartment is one ticket, separate",
          "In this times that you\u00b4re paying a big amount of money for any small thing that you want to visit, in this place you enjoy any cent,. Garden not so interesting.",
          "When you buy your tickets on box office you see different combinations. That could be confusing and we thought it could be better explained. Be careful with these if you are a \"common\" tourist just aiming to admire Cappella Palatina and a little bit more. Above all, ignore those",
          "The byzantine mosaics in Cappella Palatina are just astonishing. You cannot satisfy your senses looking and photographing them. Mouth dropping. Makes you wonder how Constantinople would have been in its days...",
          "Lovely gem in Palermo-Catania. Very enjoyable. Make sure you get a audio guide headset and visit the gardens which are beautiful. Only queued for 5 mins for tickets around 10.30.",
          "There was a kiosk close to the entrance of the palace to purchase tickets. It had a sign that listed what areas were open for visitation. Credit card was accepted, tickets were \u20ac12 per person. The Norman Palace was a working government office and was not open when we arrived. We",
          "Cappella Palatina is beautiful and worth seeing, the apartments have stunning non-religious mosaics as well. We went on a Monday in mid June late morning, and the ticket line was very long so we left and came back at 3:30 PM, hardly any wait at that time.",
          "Palace is a must visit when in Palermo. No doubt the Palatine Chapel is the highlight, but it is worth seeing the rest of the palace too, including the royal apartents as these are quite good to see. If in Palermo for a number of days, would be worth asking what parts of the",
          "The palace has many halls and a beautiful view inside. The best view in the palace is inside the chapel and in one more hall at the upper ground floor!",
          "We visited this site with our nine year old daughter and bought tickets for the entire place - the apartment, the exhibition and the chapel but not for the gardens. We also got the audio guides which was well worth it - it gives a lot of very interesting information about what",
          "We paid 10 Euros each for separate tickets to the Capella Palatina and the small exhibition at the palace. The palace itself is unremarkable, and the reason the ticket does not cover the palace gardens is beyond me, with greed coming to mind as the only reasonable explanation.",
          "The Norman Palace is an impressive building from the 10th century. Its architecture is a blend of middle eastern and western style. The old chapel is especially worth seeing due to its bysantine style and beautiful mosaics.",
          "What an interesting building - between housing the current Parliament, the apartments, The Palatine Chapel (WOW!), The Joharia Tower and the Hall of the Winds (second WOW) and Roger's room. It is right next door to the Cathedral. Yes it is quite pricey (although I the gardens",
          "The entry fee to the palace was quite expensive, considering how little there is to see and do inside. I left feeling like it wasn't worth the entry fee, especially since the apartments were closed whilst I was visiting. The chapel is impressive, but not worth the entry fee, in",
          "An interesting building which has been turned into the Sicilian Parliament. Some interesting rooms, especially the chapel. We also paid extra to see an old exhibit of things in the adjacent area. It was very interesting to see an Arabic scroll almost 1000 years old. Also a book",
          "The Normans had such huge influence in the late architecture of Palermo and the Norman Palace really brings this to the forefront. Beautiful inside and out strolling through the palace brings a rich sense of the history of the city.",
          "Worth a visit, but we were lucky to go on a day when the exhibition and chapel were open, apparently not every day. The chapel is incredible- beautiful in much gold mosaic, demonstrates examples from several cultures. The garden was dry and sparse. Our main complaint was the",
          "If you are going to do one building in Palermo then this is it. Make sure you get the right entrance as they have changed the entrance and we ended up walking around the whole building. It is very ornate and quite lovely.",
          "Only the Palitina chapel was accessible. That is unique experience. Yet the palace and the underlying church were not accessible.",
          "An UNESCO monument that everyone should visit. The full price entrance fee for every exhibition costs 14 Euro. You can visit Capella Pallatina, the royal apartments, the royal garden and an islamic art exhibition. The monument combines islamic Byzantine and Norman elements and",
          "The palace and the place deserve 5 stars. I give 1 star for welcome and service. The people simply ignore you, dont even say welcome or hi. When visit the Room of Montalto Duc, the security is really agresive if you do a picture, even if at the entrace there is no sign of no",
          "I put the Palace on my hitlist early in the planning of my trip, with high hopes of what it had to offer. Honestly the reality was not what we expected at all. It was, if brutally honest, a terrible experience from start to finish. The ticket office was located back down in the",
          "Definitely a worth while visit, over a number of floors, excellent place for photos. More for Adults than young children",
          "We spent a few hours here. Lots of information available in each room. Well worth the visit to find out the history of the place. We visited the gardens as well but, in all honesty, the gardens were not worth the time or the 2 euros extra.",
          "This is a Norman built palace and a working government building The Cappella Palatina is the highlight of the visit. The mosaics were just amazing. When we visited, the palace apartments were closed. Two caveats-there are a lot of steps to climb and there is no cafe to speak",
          "Val and I walked here from the cruise dock which was a little confusing but worth the trip. If you go in the correct direction once inside there is a wealth of information on the history of the place. We both found the history worth the reading. Of course there are lots of",
          "What an amazing place to visit! The artwork is fascinating! The Castrum Superius exhibition is an exceptional perception o f the history of the Royal A lace. Not to be missed.",
          "The apartments in the Palace were closed, but we\u2019re still charged the same amount of money as if we went in the apartments The separate exhibition was very interesting But No Where to sit down and no photos allowed The Palatine Chapel of course is amazing But for only 2 euros",
          "We visited the norman Palace earlier this week. We got our tickets and ended up spending nearly 30 euros to see everything. Inside was pretty amazing, the best part for me was the royal gardens - crazy fig trees! Also costs 50p to go to the toilet, heavy searching before anyone",
          "The city was working on renovations to the Norman Palace which was disappointing, but the chapel was definitely a must-see in Palermo. The mosaic work was amazing. The intricacy of each panel was a true work of art.",
          "Do not miss this Palace. Great example of Architecture, well conserved. Breathtaking views. Mosaics alone are deserved a trip.",
          "We had visited the Norman Palace several years ago while n a cruise and wanted to return to spend more time there. we were not disappointed. The chapel with its gold mosaics is truly amazing. we had a chance to visit the gardens on this trip and they are worth your time.",
          "16euros for a visit staff are very officious few thank yous lots of dismissive gestures. Palatine Chapel is beautiful, Royal Appartments we\u2019re closed I didn\u2019t think this palace respected its visitors or was good value",
          "The palace has many aspects and we were there on a Monday which meant that all areas were open. I particularly enjoyed the Royal Apartments as the decor and and frescoes were so inline with the time. Even the curtains were awe inspiring.",
          "Very interesting. Enjoyed a couple of hours walking around this Palace. A tad expensive I thought at \u20ac10.50 for entrance fee in comparison to other places I have visited in Italy. Having said that though, I would recommend it.",
          "If only to visit the Cappella Palatina, you must visit the Norman Palace. It's magnificent. The rest of the palace is also lovely and worth visiting, but honestly it pales by comparison. In fact, see the chapel last, leaving the best for last.",
          "Quite interesting. The chapel was lovely but far too many people to make the experience memorable. The adjoining gardens were a big let down.",
          "We bought a Euro 14 ticket which allows you entry into the Palace plus the gardens. The main attraction within the Palace is of course The Palatine Chapel but there are other things to see within a building that also operates as government offices - including the local",
          "There is not much to see. Just one chappel and the rest of other rooms was closed and they didnt let anybody to see. It eas strange since even the ticket says you have access also to other floors and rooms.",
          "This is really a gem of a building and well worth a visit it is fascinating to see what is still a working government building and also was a Norman built Palace",
          "From outside the building does not look so spectacular but the inside is definitely worth a visit. As this is a governent building not all areas can be visited all the time. You will see at the ticket office what can be visited and therefore the ticket price varies. The famous",
          "You pay 14 euros to see the royal 1 (a few rooms with paintings on the walls, nothing royal about it), the royal gardens (quite small and kind a dirty), the chapel (really beautiful, amazing) and an exibition with a few paitings that all look the same). You also get to see the",
          "This building traces the history of Sicily since the twelfth century and the presence of Norman. The atabo-normand style of the older parts is remarkable. Not to be missed for a two day stay in Palermo.",
          "In the historical side of Palermo, there are a lot of attraction, but the Masterpiece Is the Cathedral.",
          "In terms of seeing the Islamic, Christian and Judaic architecture coming together and demonstrating how they can work in peace then a visit to the Chapel is truly amazing. Given when this was constructed and the craftmanship required this is an absolute highlight of Palermo",
          "Amazing place to visit. I spent 2 hours walking around this palace. I will definitely visit again in the future. Italy is the best place in the world to go holiday.",
          "Amazing site, really worth a visit for his beauty, but poor administration. If you can't stand on your feet for a long time is going to be tough as there is no place to seat and rest for a bit even at the caf\u00e9 on the top floor. You can only eat and/or have a coffee while",
          "We came to visit the Palatine Chapel and the Royal Apartments, which were both open and absolutely stunning -- if you are interested in the Normans in Sicily, you can't miss these. However, we were disappointed with the quality of the administration of visitors -- in particular",
          "The number one place to visit in Palermo undoubtedly. The Capella Palatina, particularly, is going to leave you speechless. The mosaics are incredible, it's hard to believe they are so old! The only drawback, of course, is that you want be alone in admiring the place -it's",
          "We loved our visit here. There was a nice display of art about Rosalina the patron saint of Palermo. The government chambers were especially grand and worth visiting.",
          "Cappella Palatina is the gem hidden inside this ancient palace which also serves as the seat of the Sisilian Parlament. Notice that the entrance to the chapel and to the state rooms is from the southern side of the palace, not from the Piazza Independenza as it used to be.",
          "It was ok but not worth the tickets, esspecially the gardens which are 2 e but more beautiful park could be seen for free in front of the palace. It was stated on the brochure that it has archeological part but it was just a hole in the floor, sad to watch...",
          "Apartments were closed and ended up paying 12 euros to see the palace and the gardens . Palace was ok but not worth the money . Gardens were non existent. Had to be done to tick off a list but wouldn\u2019t rush back",
          "The building looks magnificent from outside, but that seems to be where it ends. At \u20ac10 for entry midweek (state rooms closed) we just expected more than a room of paintings and the Palatine chapel (which ok, is impressive). We were in and out in under 30 minutes, including a",
          "The royal apartments were closed when we visited, and the cost of the entrance ticket was rather confusing and overpriced. But the Palatine Chapel was beautiful and if you are in Palermo, the Norman Palace is something you must see. It's an easy walk from the center of Palermo.",
          "Half the exhibit was closed and we were charged full price. Wouldn\u2019t bother coming here. Wasn\u2019t very interesting, not for the cost. After paying entry fee you\u2019ll also need to pay extra just for using the restroom...",
          "This spectacular venue is not to be missed. Golden mosaics, high vaulted ceilings, a very special place that should not be missed.",
          "The chapel was jaw-droppingly spectacular. Utterly entralling. Well worth the cost of entry alone. The rest of the palace is so-so.",
          "Well, worth a visit, if not the most beautiful architecture in the world. Interesting to see the Norman influence on Sicily.",
          "One of the most beautiful sites of the whole country. Enjoy it in the early morning to avoid the crowd peak time!",
          "The Norman chapel is a must on any bisit to sicily the gardens and terraces are wonderful. Good limited time exhibition on the art of Santa Rosalie when we went.",
          "The palace is nice but the most beautiful place to visit is the chapel, just gorgeous. Good exhibition as well when we visited.",
          "The tickets should be sold as Palatine Chapel as there is nothing else available. It is a great work of art, however is filled with chairs on which you cannot seat and the transept is inaccessible.The room is badly illuminated and some details are difficult to see from the path",
          "15 euros to get in, the archicture is marvelous, as well as the gardens, don't miss the palatine chapel, beautiful !!",
          "The palace and chapel must be visited if you are staying in Palermo. Thankfully we managed to visit as it was closing early on the Saturday we were there due to a wedding taking place so do check the closing times rather than relying on online times so you don\u2019t miss out. Do",
          "The small, beautiful Palatine Chapel is a must visit when in Palermo. The Cappella Palatina (Basilica) was founded by Roger II and it is a jewel of Arab-Norman art with its splendid mosaics.",
          "The palace as building is wonderful, but the 12 euro entrance fee just to see just a few rooms, it was too much. Most of the rooms are closed to public",
          "The best of the Norman Palace, is the small, beautiful and illuminated Palatine Chapel built in 1192 and decorated in Byzantine-Norman style with the upper part of the walls covered with fantastic golden mosaics that represent scenes of the old and new testament. On the Abside a",
          "Other than the fact that there was a large tour group in front of us, we enjoyed the Palace and Chapel. Like most places, admission is charged which was a bit much, but worth the visit.",
          "We attended Sunday mass in the Chapel. It was a Latin mass with Gregorian chant. While modest in size the Chapel is stunning with a magnificent painting of Jesus in a huge cupola above the altar. The Chapel is a must to visit. The Palace includes the Sicilian Government",
          "There is not a huge amount to see if the state apartments are closed (as they were when we visited) and you only get a 2 euro reduction on the ticket price. The garden is a nice space: they pipe music into it and there are seats around. The leaflet is a bit confusing as it",
          "Aside from a few steps you can easily tour the rooms they have open in an hour or two. The gardens are beautiful also.",
          "The Palatine Chapel was on our list of must see places in Palermo. The place has limited hours so we arrived right at opening. For off season it was still very busy. We had no time limits on the length of our stay so could wait for that perfect spot for photography. The small",

          "The Palatine chapel is a MUST see when visiting Palermo. Amazing mozaics from the early medi\u00ebval period 12th century. The Royal Palace is worth seeing but less impressing than the chapel",
          "Capela Palatina is the most amazing place and all the exhibits are state of art. It is the top of the list of attractions in Palermo. It is a must see and absolutely superb. The palace exhibits are attractive. It is interesting that they have a newer wing and an older wing",
          "Capela Palatina is the most spectacular place on Earth we've ever visited! There are no any words on any of all of the known languages to describe the preciousness of the Chapel, it is truly stunning and breathtaking! Whenever in Palermo, we'll go there again, and again...",
          "We had a good tour of the Palace at a reasonable rate. They moved the entrance from the front to the back but no signs were posted until you get to the front.",
          "Palace exhibits are quite nice as wall as the star attraction chapel. The gardens are well worth it. Interesting plants although green houses were largely empty (November). Overall this site is rightly a must see on a short break in Palermo",
          "To see a place that is entirely covered in mosaic, with amazing detail and beauty, makes for an almost undescribable experience. The preservation of the building, the remarkable mosaics, and the exquisite beauty, were among the best we have ever seen in all our travels. If you",

          "I wish we had more time to see it and I wish the gardens were open (it was raining) but definitely worth the \u20ac10 entry. There\u2019s many discounts available so look before you buy!",
          "So firstly I would recommend that you buy tickets in advance unless you want to queue for an hour to get in. The state apartments are only open on certain days so if you want to see them make sure you check the days first (it's a reduced price on the days when they aren't open).",
          "Not sure why, but the Norman Palace didn't impress me that much. But let's take the review step by step. Buying the tickets was really confusing... They offer several types of tickets, depending on what you would like to visit. In the end we went with a ticket which covered the",
          "Of course, the Palatine chapel is the highlight, but the apartments were also very interesting. Be prepared for queues to the chapel, and perhaps it is best to see them first, get it over with, as everything else has far fewer queues. If it all gets a bit much, the gardens",

          "We visited Palermo at the end of a 2-week tour of Italy. It seemed that every day we visited a different UNESCO site, but this was one of the best! The chapel is covered in absolutely beautiful mosaics. The chapel is breathtaking. Even more inspiring is the Islamic artistic",
          "Unfortunately, at time of visit, royal apartments were closed so that was a downer. Ticket price was only slightly reduced but wanted to see palatine chapel so paid anyway. Summary - palatine chapel is amazing but frankly not worth the price without the royal apartments. Don\u2019t",

          "We've been to Palermo several times but first time here. Stunning! The issue We had was the audio guide droned on for way too long and nothing was numbered in the rooms so you couldn't follow the guide easily. No staff anywhere to ask for help. Having been to Madrid palace",
          "We only had a morning to hit the highlights in Palermo- this was the highlight. As everyone says the chapel is an incredible sight to see with the amazing mosaics- just astonishing. Get there early- lines can take awhile, but well worth it.",
          "The Capella Palatina with the Byzantine mosaics is the only one worth your time in this castle. Also the entrance to the inner courtyard is nice with the rows of columns like a cloister... It is interesting to think about the people who walked here 1000 years ago ... As the",

          "From the outside, the palace seems quite plain. But the chapel is jaw dropping! We were there with a guide and she timed it perfectly to beat the crowds. There was not a single person in line when we arrived and moving about the small chapel was fine. By the time we left, it was",
          "The chapel is absolutely awesome. Its a shame some tours occupy the space leaving individual visitors to fight through the crowd and that some visitors think it is ok to take mobile phone calls in the chapel but it is still worth a visit. The gardens are not that special but the",

          "The building itself is impressive and the chapel absolutely mindboggling, especially if one has yet to visit the cathedral in Monreale. This chapel is like a Mini Monreale. One can only stand and stare at the sheer beauty of it. The rest is very interesting but pales in",
          "We spent a couple of hours exploring here and really enjoyed it. Great architecture and stunning Chaple. We paid to enter the Gardens but felt these were nothing special, still didn't take anything away from our visit and we thouroughly enjoyed visiting.",
          "The Norman Palace and Palatine Chapel is unique in harmoniously melding a variety of styles including Norman, Arabic, and Byzantine, reflecting the different cultures that have marked Sicilian history. The chapel is particularly beautiful with its spectacular ceiling. A must",
          "The royal apartments, except 2 rooms, did not really impress us, as they are relatively standard royalty palace like in many other places from just few hundred years ago. The Chapel, however, is absolutely stunning. The mosaics, the story on the walls, the arrangement of all",
          "This really is a gem of a building. Not just the chapel that is outstanding and decorated with beautiful mosaics, but the palace with it's variety of rooms all decorated with a variety of great art.",

          "Really impressive building with wonderful square in front. Commands the area! Take the time to circle the entire building. It\u2019s as impressive from the other sides",

          "Well worth the visit. The chapel was the standout. We went early and beat the crowds which were lining up as we finished.",
          "One of the most wonderful experiences of my life. The Palace itself is tremendously imposing and worth a long visit in its own right; but the Capella Palatina is an experience that no visitor to Palermo should miss. Built for the great Norman king, Roger II, who turned Sicily",
          "You have to visit the chapel with the golden mosaics. The art is unique in the world! The palace had a lot of interesting places to visit (gardens, exhibition etc)",
          "The highlight of the visit was the Capella Palatina which I preferred to Monreale as you are much closer to the mosaics. We got there early to avoid queues and coach parties. Handing back the audio guides was a nightmare! It took a long time to collect them as there was only 1",
          "The rest was a disappointment really. But not the chapel. That was awesome. Spectacular. That alone was worth the money I'd say a definite do.",

          "Tried to get into this place twice. First time we were late getting there and were told to \"come back tomorrow\". We did after checking on Trip Advisor to confirm it was open. You can imagine our surprise to find that it was not open due to some sort of unspecified holiday.",
          "Be warned, this place is probably THE highlight of Palermo so expect to queue and don't expect to be alone while you ogle (not the right word but ordinary 'looking' is just not what you will do) the sumptuous sights on display. Every piece of the Chapel is covered in sumptuous",
          "Glorious, beautiful... Breathtaking... Be sure to make time for this stop, including the royal residence and the Chapel. Highly recommend anyone to go there, it's definitely on the list of things you have to see. The Palatine chapel and the palace are high points of our visit in",
          "The Palatine Chapel is one of Palermo's must see sights, breathtaking mosaics you can look at for hours as there is much much detail. We visited on a day when the Royal Apartments were open. I'm glad to have visited the apartments but they are not as memorable as the Chapel.",
          "While the Palace is a fascinating hybrid of styles from the outside, noting prepares you for the concentrated glory that awaits you in the Palatine Chapel. Simply dazzling right up there with Monreale and Ravenna for mosaic lovers.",
          "The Cappella Palatina is a necessary stop for anyone going to Palermo. The Chapel was built under the reign of Ruggero, emperor of the Sicilian Norman Empire. It is one of the most beautiful churches I\u2019ve ever seen in Italy. Tickets 10\u20ac each. The visit will take about an hour if",

          "One of the most spectacular places to visit in Palermo. The chapel is beautiful, reach, full of gold but the most important is to realize how much of professional work it required to decorate it. Also wooden ceiling is impressive. Palermo is not full of outstanding places to see",
          "Long queue to get in even at 10.30 in the morning but it was well worth the wait. This was a glorious place to wander through, completely unaware as I was of what beauties Sicily had to offer. It is difficult to enumerate the various vistas of extravagant decoration to which we",
          "The chapel is the most stunning part of this attraction. Keep your ticket if you are entering the gardens before leaving as you will be approached by a guard and asked to show it. If you are into Dutch art then the gallery is also worthwhile",
          "Only had 24 hours in Palermo - this is a must. The Palatine Chapel is a wonder ! The best we have ever visited. Really a wow factor.",
          "Having read the reviews we wanted to see this but on the day we went the state rooms were shut. No mention of it when we bought our ticket. Disappointed",
          "Royal chambers were closed, and they still had the audacity to take 12 euroes pr. head, just to see the Palatine Chapel. Do NOT pay to see the Royal Garden, it was not worth the money. The Chapel was beautiful but what a waste of money. Many churches in the city are much more",
          "A guided tour is what you need to appreciate the wonderful church inside the palace. Extraordinaryarchitecture, beautiful decorations, interesting historical background. A jewel you cannot miss. The royal apartments deserve a visit as well.",
          "The most important thing to see in Palermo, together with the Cathedral. Interesting building, many nice rooms inside and a nice garden next.",
          "Don't come here at the end of the day when you're hot and tired. It felt like a long haul up the marble staircase. It was interesting to see the Royal Apartments, but I really wanted to see the Chapel. It was very crowded - but you needed just to stand still in one place and",
          "Together with the monreale cathedral and cefalu Duomo, the Norman chapel completes the trio of churches with similar designs and interiors. Having seen the first 2, this one is a bit of deja vu. Also the palace apartments were closed for renovations. So if you're pressed for",

The most amusing part was at the entrance where they have Airport style \u201cSecurity\u201d the lady that was supposed to be watching the screen for the X-ray machine",
          "You pay to visit the royal chambers and chapel, there was also an exhibition of paintings while we were there. Worth the entrance of 12 euros. The palatine chapel is stunning and the exhibition was really interesting",

          "While small, the chapel is simply amazing. How any could think otherwise is beyond me. The mosaics, most inlaid with gold, are breathtaking. You have to see the details, especially on the ceiling, to truly appreciate it. Words and pictures cant do it justice. More than the",

          "We went to the palace and it turned out that Tuesdays to Thursdays the royal apartment is closed. We asked for a full ticket for what was on display and paid top price. We queued to get in and went to the Flemish paintings, which in my mind is fantastic paintings but generally",

          "We paid \u20ac16 per ticket for supposed access to the chapel and gardens. Within 10 mins of entry, we had been asked for our tickets about 5 times by various staff members. After visiting the chapel, we decided to explore the gardens. Whilst in it we were quickly approached by a",
          "Before this visit, we were not aware that Sicily (or Palermo at least) was occupied by Muslims! The palace is an interesting mix of Norman and Islamic influence. In this day and age of much inter-racial problems it is interesting that even the ancients (1066 AD onward) had",
          "The exterior of this place is amazing! However, the interior is quite boring unless you are particularly interested in the Norman rulers and there history in Sicily. However, the chapel is fantastic and worth the price of admission. It is very similar to the Monreale cathedrale",
          "If you like ancient building well your in the \"Rome\" of Sciliy here in Palermo. This is one of the must see buildings",
          "Worth the trek to see the inside of this well preserved palace. The chapel is of particular note and is a beautiful example of Byzantine Christian art.",

          "If you have the opportunity to visit on a day when everything is available, I would definitely recommend a visit. The chapel was stunning, and the royal apartments were really interesting, especially Hercules Hall. If you do visit, I recommend paying the \u20ac5 for a guide on an",
          "If you want free entry to the Palatine Chapel, get there by 9:45 on Sunday morning. Whether or not you are religious it's a great way to see the place in action. It is spectacular. The mass ends at 11 and then you can head upstairs to the Palace apartments which are far less",
          "Heard about this by chance from another tourist at dinner. Rivals the Cistine chapel , a must see! Doesn't seem like much from outside but the palatine chapel is amazing. Get the audio guide to truly appreciate it!",
          "Truly a lovely place to visit - very popular but not to be missed. The Mosaics were so impressive and the building itself is magnificant being 1000+ years old and steeped in history. Inside the palace we were shown the parliamentary chamber - again very impressive.",
          "On our last day in Palermo we decided after the catacomb visit to take a short taxi ride (to save time) to this site and I\u2019m so glad that we did as it was a highlight of our three days in Palermo and trip to Sicily. We all questioned the additional cost to include the audio",
          "I was concerned about the 19 euro for the entrance and audio guide, but it was well worth it. The Palatine Chapel is so much better appreciated with the information provided in the guide...there was an exceptional amount that one would miss without it. Even so, I doubt I",
          "We had an early morning visit to the Palatine Chapel. Clever planning by our tour guide. When we left the queues were huge. The Chapel is not to be missed, the mosaics were exceptional and the gold detailing amazing. When you think that the bulk was completed in the 12th Century!",
          "At the moment only the Palatine chapel and art gallery are accessible. The chapel is outstanding and well worth taking your time to look around - incredible mosaics! The art gallery is not particularly well stocked, with a small number of mother and baby pieces.",
          "The state of the Palentine chapel is excellent. The evidence of tolerance with islamic, jewish and christian symbols displayed in the mosaics is impressive.",
          "The Palantine Chapel is stunning, jaw dropping spectacular, and again a testament to human creativity. It is a must see!! The Palace has bits and pieces that are open and certainly worth a visit but neither the palace nor the gardens are on the scale of a lot of other European",
          "I\u2019m not one to get too excited by churches, but I was impressed by the palatine chapel in Palermo. Amazing to think how long ago the works were carried out at this site. The tilling is incredible. Not much else to see there, but impressive none the less.",
          "We really only \u201edid\u201c the Paletine Chapel inside the Norman Palace, but I have to say, it was sumptuous! The mosaics were absolutely stunnlng. The artistic/architectural fruits of the Crusaders 100 year ascendancy in Palermo are well worth seeing-and this church represents the",

          "My husband and I purchased tickets beforehand which had to be completed by a wire transfer. I wondered why this was the case but was told this was a must see on our trip to Sicily. Once there, I was happy I did this as it allowed us to get in earlier than those in the very",
          "Gave this 5 because the chapel is a stunning little jewel. The palace rooms though are a bit amateurishly decorated and only justify a quick walk through, unless like us you happen on a French guy playing a waltz in his phone so everyone in the dance room could dance. Place",
          "Would have given a higher score except there was little if interest after no more than 15 minutes with the mosaics. They were impressive though. They also sold more to see on the ticket but it was not appealing. A little confusing to find the entrance but it's on the other",

          "Long lines of people waiting for entry into palace. ( maybe an hour wait )Then u had to wait in line to see various exhibits which was good as it limited the amount of people in a room. 12 euro to visit which included the old paintings exhibits. Worth a visit",

          "Not much to see, but a big queue. If you like interiors, this palace has plenty of them and very well kept. Some nice flamming paintings gallery. A light attraction, but you can\u2019t expect more from this town, anyway.",

          "I visited the place with two children, one of them was 3 months old so we needed a stroller. The Palace doesn\u2019t have any idea of convenience for such visitors: no ramps, nothing of that kind. There was only one tiny elevator which was shown to us only by one kind member of the",
          "This arab-bysantin and naormand architecture is really the top of tis art. I never imagine the quality of the work in Sicilia.",
          "A bit tricky to find the entrance but it was worth the effort. The room with the mosaics was beautiful incredible given the age of the art work. We weren't so taken with the Royal Apartments having seen better over palaces but despite this the mosaics made the visit wothwhile.",
          "I visited this during a week day. There was about 30 minute wait to get in. The church is worth seeing and we also visited the council rooms where the ministerial meetings take place. Please note these are not open to the public on a couple of days during the week so check",
          "If you have only an hour to spend in Palermo, this is the place to go and to be Wow.... Paintings are incredible and details are just amazing It would be a miss not to go there",
          "Best place to pay 7 euros for a chapel consisting of one room. Because of all the fancy security was expecting a lot more and we arrived in a room full of people and nice art. Not saying that it wasn't interesting, only that in our opinion, not worth that much money.",
          "Amazing building with a fabulous chapel covered in mosaics. Very interesting architecture of the Norman Arab type. Also the hall of Herculean where the regional assembly meets.",
          "The chapel is totally breathtaking with mosaics and art. This is a must see when visiting Palermo. The courtyard is very peaceful too .",
          "The Palazzo has been the center of power for over a millenium and it is still the working parliament of the province so if you want to see all there is to see, make sure to schedule your visit for Friday or the weekend (otherwise the visit is limited). The gem in the building is",
          "The small chapel is the highlight of this place but there are some interesting rooms to see in the palazzo as well. We approached it on foot from the direction of the cathedral and had to walk all the way around by the adjoining street to get to the entrance to tour it. Well",
          "The Cappella is within the Palazzo, so one ticket covers both. The Capella is a masterpiece of decoration, and the apartments in the Palazzo are as opulent as anything the Romanovs could have imagined. Very Beautiful.",
          "I have travelled a lot, I have seen many churches and chapels but the Cappella Palatina, the idea of the type of ruler Roger II must have been, a visionary who understood the need for \u2018union\u2019, left me emotional and close to tears. This is a marvel, beautiful mosaics blending the",
          "The chapel is amazing and not to be missed. The Arabic Muslim influences and artistry are extraordinary. The free bus stopped right at the entrance and returned me to the Theatre Massimo. Hated having to show or stamp my ticket 4 times in the one hour I was there (why?).",
          "We visited here on a Monday as Sunday the chapel is closed for mass and other weekdays the meeting room is used by the provincial government. My partner entered the chapel in front of me and stopped suddenly I walked round him and looked in and understood why, the chapel is jaw",
          "The Palace tour consisted of three levels. The base level is an exhibition hall. The second level is primarily a chapel with beautiful mosaics. The third level contains the Palace residents quarters but it was closed mid week. Top tip: Confirm what is open when you visit as",
          "We understood that we would not be able to tour much of the palace because of renovations taking place. But we thought it would be worth it to at least see the Hall of King Roger. Unfortunately, it is very small and visitors cannot enter (the doorway has a rope). So from the",
          "We visited the palace during a workday. Unfortunately we learned afterwards that the palace rooms are only open on weekends. However, we COULD visit the amazing Capella Palatina and that is truly unique. Such richness, details and intimate ambiance. One of our example of the",
          "It is city centre for tourists. Around here there are many churchs and piazze. It is the start point to explore the city.",
          "I walked into the chapel and was completely awestruck. The walls are bejeweled with Byzantine mosaics, depicting biblical scenes in extraordinary detail. It was breath-taking and because we were off season we got to quietly enjoy the detail for a long time. I listened to a Rick",
          "The Whole City is a treasure ..don\u2019t miss going there..great markets food and people in sicily are wonderful",
          "This church had a very beautiful and unique usage of small construction pieces making up golden mosaics and decorations, something we did not see elsewhere in europe. Very pretty to walk through.",
          "Another wonderfully adorned from the normal/arab era (12th century) - golden mosaics depicting biblical scenes. Pricey 9 euros (without royal quarters which are currently being renovated) but very much worth it. When we were there, there was a watercolour exhibition of sicilian",
          "This is one of the Absolute Must Things to Do in Palermo, probably # 1 ? The Palatina is one of the Worlds most Beautiful Churches of all, you have to see it in person to believe its splendidness. See It !!!",
          "Once we saw Monreal, no other sacred space in Palermo was that special. There is much written about the Capella. Wirth r sting about it to learn how to best appreciate it. Better to see it before you see Monreal.",
          "If you like art this place is stunning... the location, the history it it brings to mind.. the connection between Carthage, Imperial Rome, Byzantine, Norman, Islamic and Catholic European history wrapped up in one building is stunning.. the fact the building is still in use is",
          "Absolutely breathtaking to see. Beautiful architecture. Easy to get to via walking if you stay in the middle of Palermo.",
          "The visit to the palace was marred by the fact that the royal apartments were 'closed for government business' - this happens several days per week so check before you go. However, it has one of the most beautifully decorated chapels I have ever seen, very similar to the",
          "Located in close proximity to the Pallazzo dei Normanni in the centre of Palermo, Palazzo dei Normanni is one of the best preserved examples of Byzantine architecture and artwork in Europe, built in 1132. Dedicated to Saint Peter, the chapel has a central basilica and features",
          "It looked really interesting but it had limited areas to explore. I probably wouldn't have gone or paid for the little I got to see.",
          "This is such an amazing place to visit, visiting Palermo and seeing the culture and what it has to offer especially its history!",
          "The palace is a wonderful example of the architecture of the Normans. Embedded in a wonderful garden it is a place to visit and relax.",
          "The main attraction of Palazzo dei Normanni is the chapel but the other rooms if open is also very interesting to see. But the chapel takes your breath away when you step into it. The gold mosaics in the chapel is so over the top that you must just take it in and take your time",
          "The mosaics and frescoes in the Capitoline Chapel are gorgeous. Absolutely sumptuous. We had fun reading the stories from the depictions. It is beautiful.",
          "The combined ticket at 8.50 euros is good value for a visit to this building, but the Byzantine Cappella Palatina is worth 80% of that price. I've never seen so much gold & intricate mosaic in one place.",
          "...then let us see it all. This place was under construction and you only got to see about 25% of place. Seriously, everything was roped off. I understand that updating is needed but don\u2019t charge full price! Also, when construction is happening with loud power drills going",
          "In September 2017 we visited Palazzo dei Normanni in Palermo to tour the Cappella Palatina (a UNESCO World Heritage site) and to see the Byzantine mosaics contained within. The Palatine Chapel is the royal chapel of the Norman Kings of Sicily and the mosaics inside have to be",
          "The Capella Palatina is a stunning mixture of Byzantine art, mosaics and gold. beautiful in a building that looks pretty plain on the exterior which is normal in Palermo! recommend you go early and miss the crowds of school kids/tourists to make for a better experience",
          "Mostly closed, its a collection of closed doors, some paintings and very little else. More guards than visitors. Not worth the effort",
          "the only way to see the Cappella is to visit the whole of the palace which is not particularly interesting. However, the Cappella is a real highlight (photos not allowed) and worth the cost of the entrance. Having a guide is worthwhile to get an explanation of all the mosaics.",
          "The royal rooms are only open from Fri to Monday as far as we can tell. We wanted to see the mosaics in La sala di Ruggero. They were worth the entry but the other royal apartments weren't very interesting. La capella Palatina is just wonderful _ the mosaics are truly stunning.",
          "The Palazzo is an imposing fortress-like building in central Palermo, used by the Sicilian government today, so call before going to make sure parliament isn't in session. The entrance is actually in the back of the palace, and it's better to get there early as the lines can be",
          "I have seen some churches but this is very impressive especially given that it is again 12 th Century and again set in the Norman period. It's best to get here early morning as the venue is small and you won't want to be stuck behind a large tour. You could combine it with a",
          "We had to queue for 10 minutes but it was well worth the wait. It is a wonderful example of the Arab-Norman architecture. The mosaics are beautiful.",
          "It is ridiculous, that wonderful cathedrals in Cefalu and Monreale are free, but in Palermo you have to pay entrance fee in practically every church. So, for not to ask loan from my bank, we have visited only one - Cappella Palatina in Palazzo dei Normanni. The ticket includes",
          "The Palazzo dei Normanni is a good place to visit. The outside architecture is very impressive and the internal rooms are nice to see. The most spectacular place within the Palace however is the chapel! The mosaics on the walls and altar alone is worth the price of admission.",
          "Don\u2019t et me wrong this is a spectator place, I wasn\u2019t as thrilled with the apartment on the third floor, but on the second floor the chapel was magnificent to say the lease. You need to buy the 3 section ticket to see everything and it is worthwhile. Pace yourself because you",
          "It was okay, if only the apartment rooms are open. :) But its still a good stop and worth visiting. The chapel mosaic is intricate and amazingly done.",
          "This is the Royal Palace of Palermo. Today it is the seat of the Sicilian Regional Assembly. The building is the oldest royal residence in Europe.",
          "The courtyard is built on three levels with Mediterranean-style colonnades of pillars at each level. Inside there are paintings of the various monarchs, mosaics and extensive Norman architecture. Attached is the Palatine Chapel which has ornate mosaics dominated by the mosaic",
          "The Palatine Chapel is stunning - well worth the admission price on it's own! The programme is the same as that at Monreale but on a smaller scale, therefore it feels more intimate and the lighting and detail are clearer. The ceiling, a rare example of purely Islamic wood",
          "We visited the palace on a Sunday morning and were lucky that we could attend a mass in the Palatian Chapel (thanks to a recommendation from our hotel). One of the most beautiful churches we have ever seen...",
          "The Palatine chapel has some of the most spectacular mosaics in Palermo, a city that seems to specialise in beautiful mosaics.",
          "Really nice visits, it lasts about 1.5 hours. Rooms that you will see are perfect also a small church inside.",
          "We were extremely excited about this site. However, due to some ongoing works, we were told that some of the royal rooms were closed. With more than 80% of the palazzo still to see, we paid full price tickets and entered. However, ONLY the capella palatina (which is sublimely",
          "Surprised no one spoke English or Spanish here. Hardly any books in English either in the bookshop. The mosaics in the chapel are breathtaking. Very busy Saturday a.m.",
          "We got here on a day when you can visit only the chapel. It was like one small very nice church but if you have the time you can see the same thing bigger and for free on Monreale cathedral.",
          "Very impressive from the outside - stunning from within. The dimensions! Mainsight of course the Cappella Palatina - unbelievable. Thanks for allowing only a certain number of people at a time - this way one can move and admire the fabulous mosaics!",
          "By all means visit this spot. It is well worth seeing. The entrance is all the top, away from the square and took us a while to find.",
          "When we first went to visit around 1w noon there was a reasonably long queue so we decided to head up to Monreale first. When we returned at around 4.15 there was no queue at all and still about 1 and a half hours until closing do in we went. Decided to head to the Royal",
          "Don't miss the Palatine Chapel. Having a guide explain the various elements of the Chapel was invaluable to get a sense of the old and New Testament mosaics and the Arab wood carvings on the ceiling.",
          "This was our main reason to visit Palermo and we were not disappointed This is a must see for anyone. Buildings making up Norman Arabic itinerary Exceptional architecture and unique",
          "I recommend going early since there is a wait to get into the Palantine Chapel even after you have purchased your ticket. I recommend paying extra for the audio guide. We spent 45 minutes inside the Chapel gazing upward and around. It truly is a feast for your eyes. What a",
          "Spectacular. The individual artistry is of top quality and the overall design for solemn occasion is perfect I spent about 2 hrs on it Unfortunately the royal apartments were closed",
          "We went on a day the royal apartments were not open. There was basically one room to visit. It was crowded and there was a line to get in. We got the audioguide which was informative but kind of useless at the same time. While I'd have liked to learn more about the history and",
          "a mixture of democracy (Sicilian parlement) and religion with beautiful wall paintings, breath taking!",
          "Worth your time more than the Duomo. Beautiful Norman palace with interesting art and rooms but not overwhelming.",
          "What an absolutely fantastic church- we were there on a day with few tours- (or between bus loads). We enjoyed the mosaics quietly- in relative calm, without a huge crush of people. It is really important to see, and words and photos can't do it justice!",
          "The palazzo opens at 8.15am, go for opening time to avoid the tour groups. We had an amazing 15mins in the chapel where it was just us and no noise. Sublime!",
          "We have seen a lot of the world! The Cappella is outstanding!!! What a beauty!!! Words mean nothing! Go there and decide yourself!! It is worth it!",
          "We went part of a Cosmos Tour. This building structure is stunning and in tip top condition, particularly considering the Normans built this centuries ago. Inside the building is picturesque . This place is a must visit.",
          "The Palatine Chapel has to be seen to be believed and is a testament to how different faiths can co-exist. You really should take a guided tour to fully appreciate it. I can't comment on the Palace as it was temporarily closed.",
          "We went early Sunday which was a good idea as someone had privately reserved the chapel for a wedding and it was closed until later. This gave us ample time to see the State rooms and other areas. Well worth any waiting.",
          "Visited on a guided tour. Amazing. We were also able to visit the second floor and see the parliamentary room and the family rooms.",
          "Not enough of words to express the amazing beauty. Beyond my expectations. Palermo is a definite walking city. I would highly recommend a visit Palazzo dei Normanni. There this great little Gelato stand right outside the from gates. A must try.",
          "With 2500 photos on this site it seemed pointless to me to add more. Only the throng of people in the chapel prevents even better movies & photos being taken. I particularly liked the ceiling, the Islamic inspired lower nave walls and the floor tiles. Of course, the wall mosaics",
          "This is simply stunning. The mosaics are tremendous. The scenes and faces depicted look great. The pictures tell great stories. The quality of the work is first rate. Please dong br like one tourist who walked through in 30 seconds,mor one who was scrolling her email",
          "The Arab Norman churches collectively are indescribable. You have to see the glittering mosaics to understand. To take this trip back in time to the multicultural sophisticated world of King Roger II and his dynasty is something every traveller should experience.",
          "Stunning views of marble mozaics, rich decorations in the capella make it a must-see attraction during your visit of Palermo.",
          "The palace of course was packed with history, amazing mosaics and some great artwork. The queue to get in was quite long and there's no shelter from the hot August sun. Take a hat. But in that delightful Italian way, even at a major attraction like this you can buy an ice cold",
          "Try to go on weekends so you can visit the state rooms as well. The capella Palatina was an amazing site, take your time to admire the artistry and the messages of the makers. Very well stocked bookshop on site as well",
          "Brought a joint ticket for the Palace and the Cappella Palatina. Both were completely stunning. Cappella Palatina was overwhelming, with the mosaics of outstanding quality. Lots of stairs to climb. Couldn't access the courtyard as work restoring this was going on.",
          "The Palatine Chapel is an incredible sight and well worth the visit. The Chapel was the royal chapel of the Norman kings of Sicily and it is situated on the first floor of the Palazzo Reale. The mosaics are almost as stunning as those found in the Norman-Byzantine Cathedral at",
          "Gorgeous palace, wished we could have seen more of it, limit your access to just a few rooms. Took about 45 minutes to view.",
          "Had a lovely morning strolling around the palace. Great place to get interior design ideas. The chandeliers are beautiful",
          "The Cappela Palatina is so phenomenally beautiful and resonant with history that I nearly wept spontaneously upon entering...and I'm Jewish! Palazzo was ok, interesting but secondary. The Capella is not to be missed.",
          "With one ticket we were able to see the Palatine chapel and the Royal palace. Get there early enough and you will not have to wait on line. The chapel is absolutely breathtaking, a must see!",
          "If there's only one thing you can visit in Palermo, don't miss the Palace and the Capella. There is queing for the Capella entry, hence plan at least 2 hours for a rather quick tour.",
          "Cappella Palatina is something you do not want to miss in Palermo, even it is the only thing you'll see, it's well worth the visit. Probably one of the most beautiful church in the world. Do expect some queue in touristic season. 12\u20ac well spent to visit the entire complex",
          "If you are in Palermo that's a must see! Go and visit both, the Palace and the Capella. The tour will take you around 2 hours. We had to queue at the Capella for around 25 minutes.",
          "Do not miss the Palatine Chapel. Take binoculars to see the incredible detail of these amazing mosaics. Also look down at the floors and at the sculptural details.Amazing jewel box of a chapel. Also do not miss Roger II's \"bedroom\" with charming, unique animal mosaics.",
          "The chapel is the best part of the visit, the Byzantine mosaics are beautiful, you won't find them somewhere else. On the other hand the palace is average, nothing special, the best rooms are the one of Wind (built from what was left of a Middle Age tower, with a nice wooden",
          "The palace is first of all chilli in the crazy heat of July which is perfect. Well structured. The chapel is one of the nicest I've seen. Not stroller friendly but we managed to carry it up the stairs. Interesting history.",
          "This was top of my bucket list for Palermo and whilst I enjoyed, it was a little below expectation. The \"chapel\" is beautiful and remarkable in its design and opulence - although occupies a fairly small space. When we visited the royal apartments were closed and the only other",
          "Relatively interesting Sicilian palace. The Capella is beautiful and worth a visit. The palazzo and royal apartments are good, however I did not feel this was worth the \u20ac12 entrance fee. Took around 1 hour to visit, when compared to other Sicilian sights such as Segesta temple",
          "Not too expensive to get in and does cater for English speaking visitors. There can be a bit of a wait to get in but worth it.",
          "The church/ chaple is a must see in Palermo amazing building and beautiful decorations. I had read up about the place and seen programme about it and it lived up to expectations. I did not go in the Royal appartments.",
          "A place to visit during your stay in Palermo. Easy to reach but check the working hours. In Italy everything is very complicated.",
          "Breathtaking work of art. Where the Arabic world meets the Norman version of Byzantine mosaics. Absolutely spectacular. To be visited in conjunction with Monreale cathedral.",
          "I had been told the Capella was on par with the Sistine Chapel, so I was disappointed. Michelangelo did not work here! Having said that, it was nevertheless a beautiful (smallish) chapel with a fascinating history. Dense gold mosaics decorate everything, so the feel is a bit",
          "if you have time for one thing only, go here. the Palace and its Palatina Chapel are a world treasure and a UNESCO word heritage site. blown aay by the beauty of the chapel's mosaics",
          "The combination of Moorish, Norman, and Byzantine architecture and decoration is breathtaking. The interior is covered with glowing mosaics. Other than Monreale, maybe the closest is St Marks in Venice. There is nothing very special about the castle part unless you love",
          "If I were to choose the best place I have seen in Palermo, it would be the Palatine chapel. It is a treasure and I hope more people around the world will be able to see this magnificent work which was finished in the 12th century. It amazes me though why the Unesco committee",
          "Price is 12e for person, 8.5e for castle and 3.5 for dungeons. In dungeons don't have noting to see. Time to visit all 1:30h",
          "It's fascinating to see the styles of architecture that the various regions have brought to Palermo. This is a fine example.",
          "Impressive and interesting building. The surrounding garden is well maintained. One of the touristic points in Palermo",
          "Move over Saint Marks... Cistine Chapel chapel pah! World class and the waits and crowding on a Monday were fine",
          "This was the home of the Kings of Sicily during the Norman domination. Today it is used for the Sicilian Regional Assembly. The building is the oldest royal residence in Europe. More importantly, the palace contains the Cappella Palatina, by far the best example of the",
          "Must see for historical and cultural lovers. Advise to visit Capella-magnificent and breathtaking peace of art.",
          "Although the chapel itself is exquisite and something different then we have seen and most of Sicily, with it's amazing mosaics, the Royal rooms are not all that and I've seen much better in other parts of Europe and even Sicily. The price he was kind of high but missing the",
          "Nice 900 year old church inside and if you go on Saturday or Sunday you get to see the royal appartment too. The church is very nice very interesting but the appartment is just ok to see, after having visited castles in France, Italy and Hungary. Don't leave out this site but",
          "The building has been maintained very well but the garden needs a lot of care as the grass has died and is overgrown",
          "Obly chappel and an average piazza is possible to village. You don't get to see anything of the inside of the palace. Besides the chapel, which is quite nice, their is a little uninteresting art exhibition. I have no idea why thia place has such a such rating. This was totally",
          "If possible use the free city centre circular bus to get here - there's a stop on the Corso Re Ruggero. Otherwise its lovely to walk through the Park Villa Bonanno from the cathedral. Although the Palazzo dei Normanni is a lovely building there isnt that much too see as part",
          "We went went the palace rooms were closed but the chapel was great (one of the several Norman/Arabic chapels/duomos in or near Palermo). Not as overwhelming as Minreale and you get closer to the mosaics. Ignore the complaints about being overpriced - you and we have spent time",
          "A nice surprise: the vucciria of Guttuso was there. Great piece of art. The palace is nice, the \"cappella\" is great, but not satisfied my expectations.",
          "This is an amazing cathedral, it's free to enter but you can pay to go to the roof tops, it's a must if you visit the area",
          "Entry to Capella 10 Euro. Photography allowed - no flash. What can I say ... Firstly, the day I went only the Cappella was open so I missed out on a visit to the Palace. Next - the entry fee is 10Euro - in my view a tad expensive to view a church. And thirdly - even though I was",
          "This Cappella is well worth a visit. The detail on the walls and ceiling is exquisite. Palermo really doesn't have many \"must sees\", but this is one of them.",
          "Gorgeous interiors. Mosaics tell a story. Also a great modern Italian art exhibition. Worth the walk up.",
          "Nothing can prepare you for the opulence and sheer beauty of the Palatine Chapel as you enter the building. Just incredible and quite possibly the only thing worth seeing in Palermo - other than the Oratorio di San Lorenzo.",
          "The Norman palace complex is one of the top attractions in Palermo. Actually the palace itself is not so impressive but the small church \"Capella Paltina\" is really amazing. A rare jewel of medieval mosaic art!",
          "The interior of the chapel is absolutely incredible. The mosaic work is breathtaking. Such craftsmanship. The palazzo is also worth seeing, but is eclipsed in my memory by the chapel.",
          "Having trudged through hundreds of churches and cathedrals, one gets bored. But this one is in the top five in Europe.",
          "The Capella is gorgeous, but rather small compared to the Cathedral of Monreale. The palazzo is nothing special, you can skip it to save on time and money",
          "Great place to visit when in Palermo. When we went, police and military were having some kind of a parade. Close to the main cathedral.",
          "The palazzo is amazing. The chapel is a sight to behold. Gold painted walls and a wonderful ceiling. Mosaic floors. The wall decorations show scenes such as Noah's Ark and other biblical stories. A photographer's dream. The apartments were also excellent. This was a visit which",
          "This sumptuous Byzantine chapel was a real treat. The royal apartments were interesting as well so I would advise going on a day when both are open. You may want to go later in the afternoon because it can be busy with tour groups who hold up the line for tickets.",
          "A visit here is a must. The decorations in both the Chapel and the Apartments are jaw dropping to say the least. Take your camera you won't believe your eyes.",
          "Must see place in Palermo. Stunning mosaics from XII century along with those in Ravenna and Constantinople, are the finest in Europe.",
          "We went on a Sunday and, regrettably, we were not able to visit the rooms of the Palace since at 12:30 p.m. they closed the entrance, while we were still waiting (for approximately 30 minutes) in a long queue. Nevertheless, the Palatine Chapel was opened for visitors and we",
          "Apart from the justifiably famous (but quite small) chapel with mosaics, this palace contains a suite of large but not very interesting palace rooms. For some reason security is airport style, and we felt that our 12 Euro entrance fee could have been better spent elsewhere.",
          "The chapel is truly a marvel. The mosaics shimmer amidst light and shadows, and there is beauty everywhere you look.",
          "Il Palazzo dei Normanni (The Norman Palace), lies in the oldest part of the city on the site of a Punic Settlement. Arriving at the palace, the stunning mix-styled architecture of the old cloister will catch you up as you gaze upon it. But the best it yet to come. Hidden within",
          "if it were the only experience (it is not), I would travel to Sicily. Incredible! mosaic, architecture everything is fine.",
          "This was really worth a visit - probably the best thing we did in Palermo. We went on a Sunday but fairly early on, so we were able to look around the rest of the Palace (royal rooms upstairs, and art exhibition in the basement) before the Palatine chapel opened at about 11.30",
          "Amazing mosaics, Palatine Chapel is astounding, such craftsmanship and so much bling. Palace is most interesting, and history of Sicily displayed in glory. Note kapok trees at entrance courtesy of the Arab settlers who contributed so much to the culture of Sicily including",
          "We visited on a Sunday and a regular morning service was underway so visiting was prohibited - not unreasonable, in fact it is delightful the chapel is still in use. We needed to queue with hundreds of others for our visit, but once the queue started moving, the wait wasn't",
          "It's important to arrive early as the queues and waiting times can be very long, but it is so worth it. What a fantastic building, the Palatine Chapel is one of the most beautiful we have seen very OTT gilt but incredible. The palace itself is interesting and the gallery in the",
          "We went here based on its high Tripadvisor ranking but I don't get it. Ok, it's a nice little church but not as good, in my opinion, as Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio yet it costs \u20ac10 to visit. Sorry but I don't wouldn't recommend visiting at all. Maybe we missed something?",
          "The inner Chappel is absolutely breathtaking and incredibly unique, which makes it worth the hordes of tourists, queues and waiting times. Rich history to the building worth exploring.",
          "We visited in the morning and were dazzled by the mosaics on the walls, floors and ceilings and impressive wooden ceiling carvings as well.",
          "The queue may be a bit long but it's worth it. We didn't visit the royal chambers but the chapel is beautiful. The old mosaic is simply awesome, so do try visit this chapel. If you're on tight budget you can just visit Monreale, also beautiful mosaic and that is free.",
          "Enjoyed our visit to Palazzo dei Normanni. The chapel was quite out of this world. Well worth a visit.",
          "Called in on Sunday morning. Just happened to be a First Holy Communion mass in progress. Couldn't believe the noise the tourists we making. Lots of locals on their mobile phones and texting. Incredulous!",
          "Well worth visiting for the stunning interior of the chapel, but do not go on a Sunday. There are only limited time slots between services and the queues are horrendous!",
          "The Cappella Palatina should be rated one of the 7 wonders of the world. You cannot believe it could have been built/finished sound 1143! Mosaics and wooden ceilings look so fresh and undamaged by age or fire or invasion etc, you cannot get your head around it. Normally any",
          "I loved the Palazzo, but I went on a Sunday, the queues to the Capella were horrendous, but worth every minute I waited",
          "The Cappella is very special, the royal apartments less obviously spectacular. But we went on a Sunday when there are a lot of free categories for Italian visitors, so we queued for an hour in the sun. Even if you've booked ahead, you only avoid the first queue for the ticket",
          "This was excellent, absolutely gorgeous and a MUST see if in Palermo. Too many things to say I enjoyed, just go, see for yourself.",
          "My wife and I visited the Capella Palatina in Palermo during a two-week vacation in Sicily. We had to search to find the entrance. It is part of the Royal Palace that is now the seat of government, so there was lots of security. At the ticket office, we purchased a ticket that",
          "We went on a day when only the Chapel was open and though it is quite fine, personally I think Monreale more striking. Also we were forced to pay for an Exhibition of Modern Italian Art which really was not worth the extra.",
          "Visit the Cappella Palatina in the Palazzo Normanii for a rare and remarkable example of a Christian church richly decorated in Arab design - as well as Byzantine decoration in in a romanesque structure: ccultural tolerance which shows what we have to learn from previous",
          "The tour was pretty much limited to a tour of the chapel and a small, not-very-interesting modern art collection. The chapel/Cathedral was nice, but there are so many incredible churches thought Italy and Sicily that this one is not worth making the trip. The apartments that I",
          "This was like traveling back through history; all the way back to the Normans. Numerous portraits of royalty back through the ages, even as far as King Rogers actual apartment. The highlight was undoubtedly the Capella Palatina. A masterpiece of architecture, mosaics, arabic",
          "Worth going for the mosaics, but the royal apartments I would not worry about to much unless you are really into that sort of thing.",
          "If there is one thing you most definitely have to see in Palermo, let it be the Palatine Chapel, built in various styles where christian, orthodox and muslim influences create one beautiful whole. We visited in March before closing hours, there weren't many tourists, but in high",
          "We were fortunate enough to breeze right in. Go early if you can. The gardens on the outside are pleasant to walk around",
          "Find few hours to spend in this spectacular palace and take the time to visit the magnificent Cappella Palatina. Cannot be missed!",
          "The Capella lives up to its reputation and the Byzantine mozaics are of the finest we have seen. Get there as early as you can to avoid the coach parties which arrive late morning and early afternoon",
          "This is the jewel in Palermo's extraordinary history of respect for Islam and Christianity in the design and decoration of one building. More relevant than ever to our age. Don't miss this or Monreale Cathedral.",
          "This place is worth checking out. The interior of the Cappella Palatina is stunning and truly unique. A must see while touring Palermo.",
          "Very interesting and beautiful, especially the chapel. It helps to do a little reading on the history first since there are so many layers here as in most of Sicily. It would be nearly impossible to fit it all into the brochure. It helped to have the context of the building's",
          "A place not to be missed in Palermo, a real masterpiece for humanity. Everytime I enter the Chapel my body feel the high content of sacrality",
          "MISSED MOSAICS THIS YEAR because website says open til 5:45. BUT does not say they only sell tickets until 4:45. To be safe I'd be there by 4:30. Lots of disappointed people like us were turned away. NB: can be hard to find entrance. From public parking (marked on WAZE) past",
          "The Chapel is notable for the purity and consistency of its Byzantine mosaic decoration (when compared, for example, to the mishmash of La Martorana). It helps to have an understanding of the Biblical progression from Genesis onwards that is depicted in the mosaics but even in",
          "The Royal Apartments in the Normal Palace are very interesting, but since our only time to visit was Sunday morning, we came early to attend the 10 am mass at the Cappella Palatina. Their website touted Gregorian Chant, but it was just a downtown church with a small choir. The",
          "The mosaics are stunning - full of colour and life. They are worth a visit. BUT:the signposting to the entrance is disgraceful; we walked 15 minutes around the huge site before we found it. BUT: we were persuaded to but 2 tickets - one for the mosaics, the other for the",
          "We visited the palace yesterday and the royal apartments were not accessible. However, nothing could be be better than the stunning Capella Palatina. The mosaics cover every surface, seem beautifully preserved. We spent over an hour deciphering the various biblical stories",
          "We visited on a Friday at the end of April and there were a couple of college groups visiting - kids were pretty rude, but the queues weren't huge as a result - although I know it does get busy and it is often worth booking ahead in the summer. The art exhibition on the ground",
          "The Cappella isn't open till 11:30 on Sunday so did the Royal Apartments first. Very worth seeing. By 11:20 masses of people waiting for the chapel. The crowd moved quickly & I was in by 12. As I was leaving there were masses of people queuing outside for tickets. Weekdays, is",
          "Great but busy, it is 30 April but already busy. Expect queues, particularly Capella Palatina but don't miss it.",
          "Since there was a mass going on early in the morning, we decided to get there as early as possible to wait until we would be able to get in. We were able to walk around the apartments and see the different rooms that are still in use today, but nothing could've prepared us for",
          "This is the highlight of a visit to Palermo, but without the audio guide, it is hard to know what is going on. They ran out of English pamphlets, so as we walked around the various gorgeous rooms, we had little idea of the history or purpose. If I went back, I would definitely",
          "This is a must if you are visiting Palermo. And you should definitely climb up on to the roof. You get an awesome view",
          "It's alright if you like old Christian art. I don't personally enjoy that. But the architecture is great. For that reason, it's worth checking out.",
          "With a lovely wooden ceiling and mosaics this is worth seeing on a visit to Palermo. We had to queue for quite a while so be prepared.",
          "Well worth a visit . Closed early as it was Easter Sunday. Very impressive chapel. Palace very well maintained inside.",
          "And living in Florence, we've done our share! This little chapel is truly stunning, a little jewel box. Artisans from Maghreb did the ceiling which in my opinion is the best part, but the mosaics just underneath with scenes of the Bible are exquisite. Worth going to Palermo just",
          "It's the place where all, really all, tourists meet. Therefore: go there in the morning. The church is certainly outstanding, but you rather should rather go to Monreale, which is even more impressive.",
          "Pop in if nothing else to do. Plenty of art and grand rooms to explore. Save for a rainy day, as worth a visit.",
          "The cappella palatina is a unique sight. Wonderful mosaics. Audioguide explains really well. Rest of palace also worth the visit.",
          "Viewed together with the Cathedral Monreale, you can see the flowering of Norman Arab culture and architecture around the year 1000.",
          "The Palazzo dei Normanni is a beautiful building with lots of history. It is very interesting to see and explore. Among the more interesting things to see are a beautiful church, the luxury apartment where the royalty used to live, and the seat of the current local government.",
          "When you go to Palermo. You should really visit this place. Wonderfull mosaique, beautifull chapel. Worthwile",
          "Airport type security at the entrance before entering the fantastically decorated building. Beautiful pictures made up of thousands of tessera to make the mosaic, vast areas of gold. The walls are decorated with bible scenes from the Gospel. The wooden ceiling is fantastic. All",
          "I could not believe just how much gold is found in the Capella Palatina. It was all a bit overpowering. The palazzo was superb and well-worth the visit.",
          "We walked half way across Palermo, dodging thunderstorms, to get here - me lugging camera, lenses, lightweight tripod on slippery pavements. Still, made it in one piece. Queueing was done with really quite quickly but my heart sank when I saw the \"no weapons / no knives / no",
          "This is a must if you are remotely interested in history, mosaics or just visiting somewhere beautiful. We visited at the beginning of April and did not experience any problems with queues or large groups of tourists. The audio guide is a must if you do not have a personal guide.",
          "We visited this cathedral on out Sicilian tour with a group from Australia. Our guide brought the place alive with his thorough and factual dialogue. The mosaics and architecture are amazing, well worth a visit. An audio guide would be a must without a guide.",
          "If you are in Palermo this is an obligatory visit and is well worth seeing. Be prepared to queue and brave large groups of tourists and teenagers. The book shop is probably the best place in Palermo to stock up on guide books to this and numerous other sites. Strangely they are",
          "I have wanted to visit the seat of King Roger since read John Julian Norwich's excellent history \" The Normans in Sicily\". The first moment you step into the space of the chapel your breath is simply taken away.",
          "Spectacular, intricate gold-backed mosaics of the Cappella Palatina (Palatine Chapel), royal chapel of the Norman kings, designated World Heritage site, built for Arab emirs and their harems in the 9th century. Shimmering, glittering 12th-century, minute gold-backed tesserae",
          "We've seen some places in Europe and this one is worth a visit. The mix of Muslim, orthodox and Norman style are really awesome and while palace itself is very similar to roman baths at Bath, the capella is really a gem.",
          "Well worth the trip ! Amazing. The mosaics in the Palatine Chapel and in the Palace are extraordinary",
          "We had a great time once we found the lower parking lot and ticket office. For \u20ac3 per person we grabbed taxis up to the top and then walked leisurely down through the site. Our kids loved climbing on the walls and watching goats try to knock olives off trees with their horns.",
          "I would have come to Sicily just to have seen this chapel. It is breathtaking in design and execution and the longer I stayed admiring the craftsmanship the more I saw. I could have spent days admiring it. I am so glad to have seen this.",
          "A stunning mex of Arabic and Norman art. A magnificent wooden ceiling. Royal crypt. A true monument worth the time for visit.",
          "Palermo is awash with beautiful piazzas and buildings and this is no exception. The whole place is a feast for the eyes. Binoculars are a great asset to view the detail of buildings.",
          "This should be your primary objective in Palermo. The mosaics and marble work are out of this world. Unbelievable art in a very grand surrounding. Almost beyond description. Very historic.",
          "Beautiful and next to the arch. Beautiful grounds with a fountain and gardens. Nice for walking around and close to the cathedral.",
          "This is quite the most impressively decorated church that I have ever seen. The workmanship is exquisite but even more so is the harmony of the work fusing Christian and Moorish cultures. Breathtaking!",
          "Amazing mosiac in the chapel and the Roger Hall. The artistry and architecture of the chapel were beyond words. We went on a Sunday and the admission was 8.50 Euros, well worth the price. The hours was till 1 pm and the chapel was opened at 11:30 am. We toured the royal palace",
          "The Palace is only open on weekends. During the week Congress use the rooms for meetings. We paid 12 euros each to visit the chapel. I would recommend checking the opening schedule before your visit",
          "The Roger Hall in the Palace is a stand-out and the Cappella Palatina is amazing and extraordinarily beautiful (and in excellent condition). Go early to avoid the crowds in the Capella--there is crowd control--but it gets a bit crowded nonetheless. We were in the first set",
          "Don't miss this stunning chapel and Palazzo! It's truly one of the most important sights in Sicily. (Best seen with a guide who can explain everything.)",
          "We went in February so fortunately the crowds were not great meaning that we were able to spend time in this tremdously beautiful and impressive chapel. The mosaics are incredible and the atmosphere intimate in spite of the gold and the glory. A superb example of the meeting",
          "The entry is on the back corner of the palace. An incredible place. Built by Roger II in 1132. The Cappella is a jewel of Arab-Norman art. Very impressive collection of mosaics. The wood ceiling is a masterpiece of Muslim art. Unique place worth 1-2 hours to experience and",
          "Entry was 12e . You go through bag scanning and metal detector on way in. Entry included 3 floors of attractions. You can pick up basic leaflet or pay for audio guide . We visited capella Palestine first. An absolutely stunning building with mosaics using golf leaf and carved",
          "This is a completely extraordinary walk back in time - the foundations of this building were part of the Emirs who came over for two centuries and marked out the great sea battlements of the Port of Palermo, before the Norman conquering family of Roger and Robert (de Hauteville)",
          "OVERALL: 2 very different and well worth it exhibits. Upstairs - Palatina Chapel. Downstairs - Underwater archaeological exhibit. PALATINA CHAPEL - intimate chapel whose craftsmanship can be overlooked by the glow of gold. Take time to see how the mosaics were assembled to",
          "Chapel has really incredible mosaics. It was little bit of a let down as the rest of the building is closed most days of the week.",
          "BREATHTAKING capella Palatina inside the palace ! Not to be missed !! the little sister of cattedrale monreale which is also indescribable with beauty and much bigger . Inside the capella Palatina there is a mass on sundays at 10 am .",
          "The Capella with it's mosaics is absolutely stunning. It was a return visit for us as when we first visited 8 years ago unfortunately, the Capella was undergoing restoration and much was covered in scaffolding. Glad we came back again. The undersea archaeology exhibition was",
          "It is very limited space since the big part is being used by government. It happened to witness underwater gallery which was fantastic.",
          "Very big structure but nothing special in the outside. It was close on the subday that we visited it.",
          "The Capella Palatina is the high point of a visit to Palermo. The mosaics are superb and timeless. Unfortunately, the rest of the palace was closed when we visited though there was a good exhibition on underwater archeology.",
          "This small chapel will astound you. The mosaic work is another of Sicily's masterworks! At Christmas there was not as much of a line but it was still a constant flow of viewers in the hour or so we spent in the chapel. I can only imagine how the tour groups would flow through",
          "entrance from Piazza Independenza with airport style security, \u20ac8 for a combined ticket giving access to Cappella Palatina + Royal Apartments, as well as current exhibition Mirabilia Maris",
          "it's a amazing, building, inside all ages, like a castle (arabic) after normann etc. Price to go in 11 euros but is necessary to visit this place to know Palermo.",
          "My only criticism is that the entrance is difficult to find. One has to enter through visitors entrance in backside near traffic circle. The chapel with the mosaics on the walls and ceilings was amazing. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Worth the trip to Palermo. Just fantastic. Great place of wisdom and co-habitation among cultures and religions. Hate to see this as the home of a disfunctional local government.",
          "Really worth a visit, especially the chapel is breathtaking. We were lucky to be able to visit a presentation of archeologic findings in the sea around Sicily which was really interesting.",
          "You que up, pay a lot, walk in a row together with several other tourists to see Capella Palatina. You get in and realise that it is very much a smaller copy of the Cathedral in Monreale. Lot smaller. And plenty more tourists. It's still wonderful the capella Palatina, but go to",
          "Don't be fooled by an outside view. The building looks like it is about to fall down...Make sure to visit Cappella - it is world level treasure. Nearly a thousand years old. The mosaics are simply spectacular.",
          "We visited here to see the ornate ceiling of the Capella palantina after visiting the Monreale cathedral which also has a stunning mosaic ceiling, this was my favourite, smaller but just dripping with detail. Truly beautiful.",
          "The exterior of this great building discloses only its obvious great age. Inside are treasures. Be sure to time your visit to when the royal apartments are open. This is when the Sicilian regional parliament is not in session. And when you do visit book for the apartments and",
          "The palace is not always open to the public, since it is where the parliament works, so make sure to choose the right day to visit. It has some beautiful antique rooms which are very interesting but, for sure, the high point of the visit is the Cappella Palatina. If you like",
          "The palace itself is nothing special, but the Chapel is beautiful. We had an oportunity to hear a little bit of explanation about the mosaics and it improved our expeirence a lot. Try to do so or find a guidebook with little more explanations about the chapel - it makes visit so",
          "The palace is built in arab-bizantine style. Beautifull Cappella Palatina from the 12 th century, with marble floors and incredible mosaics.",
          "In the Palatine Chapel, you will be overwhelmed by the beauty and artistry. Incredible mosaic religious art and marble floors. Unusual mash-up of Byzantine, Roman & Arabic. This is the most important site in Palermo. Palace apartments are worth a visit.",
          "This church is one of the most beautiful work of arts in southern Italy. It's Arab-Bizantine style give it a unique flavor which is paralleled only by the Monreale Cathedral. The rest of the palace is interesting but only one room is remarkable.",
          "The most famous part of the palace is Capella Palatina but the entire palace is also a nice place to see if one is interested in the history of Secily",
          "The mosaics here are similar to those in Monreale but the chapel is small consistent with it's private nature. 10 euros to enter is steep but does include an exhibit of archaeological treasures recovered from the sea. We could not visit the Royal Apartments as they are only open",
          "The Palazzo was hard to get in, never did get into the chapel with another very long line in front. The Palace was very unique, with a lot of other cultures influence in the d\u00e9cor. Mostly because the Portuguese traveled the world. Take a bottle of water",
          "The Chapel is one of the most beautiful churches we have seen. And we had the pleasure of attending the Sunday Mass. what an experience. The place is incredible to see.",
          "I read all the reviews and went against my instinct of paying to visit places. I was made to pay \u20ac10 as there was an exhibition on and no option to just visit the palace. I got in expecting to be wow'd. There was 1 room to visit. It was a nice chapel - I wouldn't say as nice as",
          "The palace is one of the must sees in Palermo. We were there in the opposite of the touristic season. No queues and no other visitors apart from a German bus group that was unfortunately in Capella Palatina when we were too. But apart from the Capella I didn't find the sight so",
          "The chapel is beautiful with its mosaics and wood ceiling, worth a visit. The interior of the palace may appear humble but it contains some remarkable historical artefacts, mainly mosaics and paintings. There was a fascinating temporary exhibition of sub-marine archaeology",
          "The Cappella Palatina is one of those places impossible to describe. Its mosaics are something to behold, they are stunning.",
          "Emotional experience, you can fill the history of Sicily in the Normans and Arabs Age. You can hear the steps of Federico II moving from Palace Chapel to Winds Room.",
          "Welcome to The Ancient Parlament in the Word, the Court of the Kings, and the first settlement of Fenician Ziz builders... IIV Century B.C.",
          "The mosaics in the church are amazing but the private rooms are also fantastic. Must see attraction in town.",
          "The building, the interior and the exhibit were absolutely breathtaking. I am in awe of the history behind the location.",

          "The garden are very small but nicely decorated. The apartment area of the royal castle is not big but rich of precious Chinese vases and nice frescos. The most beautiful place is the Palatin Chapel that can leave you without breath for the \u2026",
          "So many new about Sicily you may know to visit this place of mixed cultures",
          "Very nice sightseeing. Unfortunately we visited at night so we couldn't go inside, but it was worth it.",
          "One of the oldest palaces in the world, it's age is evident from the outside while inside esp. the palatine chapel is just magnificent!!",
          "The queues were incredible, we went early on Sunday morning and still had to wait for 40 mins to see the chapel, and as we exited the queue was several hundred people in length. Go early or give it a miss.",
          "The palace looked much more interesting outside than inside. The noble floor was closed when we went so a big part of the palace was not open. The Palatine Chapel is quite remarkable and decently worth a visti. Other than that our experience was rather underwhelming.",
          "Magnificent place. Highly recomended.",
          "Worth it just for the chapel inside. The mosaics are amazing but the ceiling is just the most amazing wood art I\u2019ve ever seen. The audio guide is helpful for the background of it- not worth looking at if you don\u2019t know the history. Some weeks and months you can\u2019t see the royal apartments and I\u2019m not sure how you check before.",
          "The Palatine chapel is amazing, well worth a visit.",
          "So firstly I would recommend that you buy tickets in advance unless you want to queue for an hour to get in. The state apartments are only open on certain days so if you want to see them make sure you check the days first (it's a reduced \u2026",

          "Very very expensive.Be careful:some days you can not see the palace.Only the church inside,but nobody informs you for that.We paid 12 euro to see only the church and the exhibition :( if we had go on Saturday we would have give 14 euro including the 2o floor. Save your 12 euro for something else.",
          "Go early, before the huge crowds. An architectly remarkable blend of Arab, Norman and Baroque.",

          "What an amazing building. Beautiful mosaics. Extremly impressive.",
          "Nothing special... for price 12 \u20ac from person. Royal Garden - looked like a simple, usual park you can see in each city:)",
          "Totally worth visiting. Amazing chapel",
          "What a shame for this important building and story! Unfortunately they don\u2019t really care for it",
          "Unique mixture of architecture style and cultural traditions of different people which were inhabiting Palermo and Sicily in 12th Centrury - right after Norman conquest! Arabian style with Byzantine traditional mosaics and Roman \u2026",

          "I use to visit here for some fresh air",
          "Not worth it until the apartments reopen. They want \u20ac10 for the church which was very interesting but not as awesome as the \u20ac2 church in town. The one room museum is not worth it either, plenty if other things to see in Palermo.  The 1700s cart is neat though.",
          "I'm not a student of art but I enjoy visiting historic museums because I can appreciate the beauty in the work.  I spent all my time in the Capella Palatina. In hindsight I wish I would have got one of the audio tours to help me better \u2026",
          "Fantastic palace!  The Palatine chapel is truly a gem. Not to be missed.",
          "Really make an effort to see this place. The mosaics are outstanding and it is nearly a thousand years old! But this Norman cathedral is very different from all the other religious edifices that I saw in Italy, including Rome. I only wish that we had spent more time there!",

          "The Chapel is just amazing. Keep in mind that the entrance with no extras is 8.50 euros, if they charge more it means that they are adding extra visits which might not be worth at all.

        "wiki": "Saint Olivia of Palermo (Italian: S. Oliva d\u00ec Palermo, Sicilian: Uliva di Palermu), Palermo, 448 \u2013 Tunis, 10 June 463, is a Christian virgin-martyr who was venerated as a local patron saint of Palermo, Sicily in the Middle Ages, as well as in the Sicilian towns of Monte San Giuliano, Termini Imerese, Alcamo, Pettineo and Cefal\u00f9.\nHer feast day is on June 10, and she is represented as a young woman with olive branches surrounding her, holding a cross in her right hand.\n\n\n== Hagiographic sources ==\nSaint Olivia seems to have been sanctified\n by popular tradition alone as a pious local saint, since her name was not recorded historically in any mainstream Latin or Greek martyrology or Hagiology of the Church.The oldest textual sources of her Life include a Gallo-siculo Breviary of the twelfth century, which records her memory and is still preserved in Palermo, as well as a document in vulgar Sicilian of the fourteenth century found in Termini Imerese, and a Life contained in a lectionary of the fifteenth century.\n\nA venerable icon of Olivia also exists, perhaps of the twelfth century, which depicts Saint Olivia with saints Elias, Venera and Rosalia.There are also references to a church being dedicated to her in Palermo since AD 1310 on the supposed site of her burial. Today this is the Chiesa di San Francesco di Paola (Church of Saint Francis of Paola).\nIn addition, numerous Lives of this Saint were published in Sicily, both in prose and in verse, and also in the form of sacred representation until the end of the eighteenth century, reflecting the fair vitality of her cult. She is recorded in the Sicilian martyrology of father Ottavio Gaetani (SJ), as well as in the Palmerian martyrology of father Antonio Mongitore in 1742. A Breviary from Cefal\u00f9 also contains a detailed entry on her Life (Breviary Cefaludes).The Bollandists published in 1885 the Acts of Saint Olivia, which they took from the lectionary of the Church in Palermo.Moreover, Sicily's most illustrious writer of the 17th century, the poet Petru Fudduni (born Pietro Fullone) wrote a poem in 114 octaves about her, while a dramatic opera of Gioacchino Bona Fardella, a tragedy in three acts, was also famous in its day.\n\n\n== Hagiographic life ==\n\nAccording to the hagiographic legend, Olivia was the beautiful daughter of a noble Sicilian family, born around 448 AD. Local hagiographers state that she was born in the Loggia district of Palermo. From her early years she devoted herself to the Lord while declining honors and riches, and loved to give charity to the poor. In 454 AD Genseric, king of the Vandals, conquered Sicily and occupied Palermo, martyring many Christians. When she was thirteen Olivia began to comfort the prisoners and urged the Christians to remain steadfast in their faith. The Vandals were impressed by the strength of her spirit, seeing that nothing could prevail against her faith, and so in deference to her noble house, they sent her to Tunis where the governor would attempt to overcome her constancy.\nIn Tunis Olivia worked miracles and began to convert the pagans. The governor therefore ordered that she be relegated to a lonely place as a hermitess, where there were wild animals, hoping that the beasts would devour her or that she would die of hunger. However the wild animals lived peacefully around her. One day some men from Tunis who were hunting found her, and impressed by her beauty tried to abuse her; but Olivia converted them too with the word of the Lord and they were baptized. After miraculously curing many of the sick and suffering in the region, Olivia converted many pagans to the Christian faith. When the governor heard about these things he had her arrested and imprisoned in the city in an attempt to make her apostatize. She was scourged and she was stripped and submerged into a cauldron of boiling oil, but these tortures did not cause her any harm, nor did they make her renounce her faith. Finally she was beheaded on June 10 of the year 463, and her soul \"flew to the sky in the form of a dove\" (Italian: \"sotto forma di colomba vol\u00f2 al cielo\").\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\n\n=== Patron saint of Palermo ===\nAt the end of 1500 her cult was spread by the Franciscans, who sought her body.On June 5, 1606 the people and Senate of Palermo elected Saint Olivia as Patroness of the city, together with Saint Agatha, Saint Christina and Saint Nympha. These four patronesses were chosen for each of the four major parts of the city. Their commemoration was entered in the Palermian Calendar by Cardinal Giannettino Doria in 1611.Their veneration waned following the discovery in 1624 of the (alleged) relics of Saint Rosalia, who had appeared to rescue the city from the plague. Thereafter Saint Rosalia began to be venerated as a patroness of the city as well.In 1940 a parish was dedicated to Saint Olivia in the city.Her commemoration as patron saint continued to be celebrated by the Church in Palermo until 1980 as a mandatory commemoration. However, in 1981 it was officially removed from the local Liturgical Calendar.In Tunis, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul and Saint Olivia is also dedicated to her. It was begun in 1893, replacing the oldest Christian monument in the city (a chapel built Father Jean Le Vacher in 1650), and was opened on Christmas of 1897.\n\n\n=== Saint Olivia and Islam in Tunisia ===\n\nThe Great Mosque of Al-Zaytuna (\"Mosque of Olive\") is the oldest in the Capital of Tunisia and covers an area of 5,000 square metres (1.2 acres) with nine entrances. Its exact building date varies according to the sources. Ibn Khaldun and Al-Bakri wrote that it was built in 116 Hijri (731 AD) by Obeid-Allah Ibn Al-Habhab. However, Ahmed in Abu Diyaf and Ibn Abi Dinar attributed its foundation to Hasan ibn al-Nu'man, who led the conquest of Tunis and Carthage. Most scholars agree that the closest date is 84 Hijri (703 AD), and what Al-Habhab did was in fact enlarge the mosque and improve its architecture.One legend states that it was called \"Mosque of Olive\" because it was built on an ancient place of worship where there was an olive. However the most accepted explanation is that transmitted by the 17th century Tunisian historian Ibn Abi Dinar, who spoke about the presence of the tomb of Santa Olivia at that location. Recent research has shown that indeed this mosque was built on a Christian basilica. With the advent of Islam, the church was converted into a mosque, retaining the dedication, but translating the name into Arabic.\nThe saint is particularly venerated in Tunisia because it is superstitiously thought that if the site and its memory are profaned then a misfortune will happen; this includes a belief that when her relics are recovered Islam will end. This ancillary legend related to the discovery of the saint's relics is widespread in Sicily, however it is connected to other Saints as well.In 1402 king Martin I of Sicily requested the return of Saint Olivia's relics from the Berber Caliph of Ifriqiya Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II, who refused him. Even today the Tunisians, who still venerate her, believe that the dominion of their religion will fade when the body of the Virgin Olivia will disappear.\n\n\n== Historicity ==\nThe main criticism of the life of Saint Olivia is that the elements of her legend do not have a personal nature in and of themselves, but they all derive, with slight modifications, from old themes or archetypes that were dear to the medieval imagination, such as that of the  'sacred heroine'  or the  'persecuted maiden' . The Italian teacher and writer Giuseppe Agnello carefully undertook to sift the hagiographic tradition from the literary one, and did not see anything more than a random homonymous saint of Palermo conflated with the heroine of the mystery play dedicated to her, which was studied extensively by Alessandro d'Ancona and Alexander Veselovsky (who in turn cited Ferdinand Wolf).Nevertheless, Msgr. Paul Collura defends Saint Olivia's historicity writing that \"the core of our ancient legends has a substrate that should not be underestimated, and since the Arab domination in Sicily (827\u20131092) made a clean sweep of all the written documents, sacred and profane, the memory of several Saints has been handed down only on the thread of memory.\"Furthermore, it has been accurately pointed out that the Roman Catholic church has remained somewhat aloof from Southern Italian saint cults.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n(in Italian) Sant' Oliva di Palermo Vergine e martire.

          "Very impressive cathedrals with quite a few different aspects. The main cathedral with the usual spectacular interior, a small museum, a crypt and the option of a walk on the roof to get fantastic views of the cathedral from another angle and of the city. Well worth the money",
          "This Cathedral is best from the outside. We loved sitting on the benches outside on the street and observing people on the roof and taking in the views of this amazing building. It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s as old as it is . There\u2019s a great information board outside in English and",
          "If you don't have time to visit all the 550 churches of Palermo, make sure to see at least the cathedral. A real beauty - inside and outside.",
          "There are a few different ticket options, we opted for the cathedral and the rooftop. The cathedral itself isn\u2019t the most beautiful but still lovely. You then wait to go up to the roof, there are a lot of steps up and we were first to go so you feel under pressure to walk",
          "Not sure why cruise ship stopped palermo. Very dirty city. The cathedral is the highlight of town. Ticket is confusing You do not need ticket for cathedral itself. However if you want to see crypt and go on roof a ticket is required These are purchased in the cathedral",
          "We had read that the cathedral may not be open on Sunday afternoon - that was not the case. It is free to enter the cathedral and walk around the interior, but you pay to see the crypt, roof etc (these paid-for areas were closed). Cover your shoulders, or you will have to buy a",
          "After a disappointing trip to the Royal Palace which is about a 1/2 mile south this cathedral was quite impressive. Women need a shirt with sleeves or a shawl ($1 euro to buy a cover at door) so it\u2019s not a big deal. There is no charge for entry which is amazing considering we",
          "Stunningly beautiful ,the view from the roof is breathtaking although there are a lot of stairs to climb",
          "You have to pay to go to the upper area to walk around the outside. Great interior. Not many signs to read to describe what you are looking at. No guide book that we could find.",
          "Compared to the many other ecclesiastical treasures in Palermo, the interior of the Cattedrale is unremarkable but at least it is entirely free and if you are observant, you will discover a nice set of servizi in one of the side chapels. However, unless you are fixated on 2nd",
          "You can tour the cathedral on your own for free and the extras to the treasury and the roof are worth the few Euros. Read up on the cathedral before hand so that what you\u2019re seeing makes sense.",
          "One of the most beautiful cathedrals I\u2019ve ever seen. Amazing architecture. A must if you are in Palermo.",
          "Really beautiful building & grounds, a must see when in Palermo. You must visit the little juice stand opposite the building too- ask for a Sicilian spritz...you won\u2019t be disappointed! Sit there and enjoy the view!",
          "Much more impressive on outside than inside, but inside quite nice. Be sure to see side altar on right for silver altar honoring patron saint of Palermo. On left side info on priest murdered by mafia and on his way to sainthood.",
          "This was a bit of let down after some of the stunning churches we had been to and way more pricey. We paid for the full package and got to go to the top to view the city which was nice, see the treasures and the crypt.",
          "Worth a visit, beautiful building. There are regular mass so to have a walk around best to go out side those times",
          "If you visit one Cathedral then I would suggest this one. It was close to our hotel and we were able to walk here. Lots of history surrounding this Cathedral. You should expect to spend 30 minutes here.",
          "Well worth the visit!!!!! Visited the treasures of the palace and they were fantastic, Totally loved the city and all surrounding area. I reccomened you go if in Palermo!!!!!",
          "It is a very beautiful cathedral where you can find a lot of history : tombs of royalty and not only. When you get inside if you are not dressed properly you can get an one use cover for 1\u20ac. Tour busses arrive constantly and it\u2019s always very crowded, you can enjoy the greatness",
          "This is a large and impressive cathedral. Though the art is not the most impressive in Palermo, it is still a beautiful church and well worth the time to visit.",
          "This is a classic example of a cathedral style church because of its impressive outside beauty and the simplicity inside. The church is not really the best and it\u2019s pretty basic for the standards of Palermo\u2019s churches.",
          "Visited from the outside, i wore shorts so was not allowed in. The prettiest building in Palermo. Huge historic significance as an example of multicultural architecture, showing Muslim and Christian influences.",
          "Built in different styles over many eras, the cathedral is a very interesting place to visit. Does not leave the same impact as the Cappella Palatina, but still not to be missed if in Palermo.",
          "This is a must see when visiting Palermo. The Cathedral is amazing and its surrounding piazza is as well.",
          "Approach this via a monumental archway for best effect. Usual grandiosity but surrounded by pleasant cafes.",
          "We only looked from the outside. After many comments, we passed on paying for the interior view. Instead, we walked around and enjoyed the magnificent architecture and style. The area around this landmark have many places to get food or drinks or snacks to relax and take in",
          "The cthedral is very big and impressive with ornaments and statues. Before you enter it the yard is also large and fantastic. recommended",
          "Good place to spend a hour or so. Church is free but you can visit other parts by buying a ticket. Lovely altar paintings.",
          "Please note that shoulders must be covered to enter. They sell covers for \u20ac1 I believe. We purchased a package to go to the tower and see the crypt for \u20ac10 per person. They took credit cards. There was much more to see than we expected. It was amazing. We first went a room on",
          "This cathedral has an interesting mix of styles, both inside and out. Definitely worth a look round the exterior. A guide is useful to get the most from the side chapels and the history. Free to enter but one euro if you are not dressed modestly for a papery overdress for the",
          "I visited here when they had a service on, and it was packed, but fantastic. Also I went another time when I could walk around and it is huge inside. You can also pay a little and walk around the roof top of the Cathedrale, with great views of Palermo.",
          "Free entry into this beautiful church. Stunning architecture reflecting the different powers that ruled in Palermo throughout its history. Persian Roman Norman influences. Dress codes apply make sure you bring a scarf to cover your shoulders if you are wearing a sleeveless top.",
          "This is a must visit. It is a impressive building that is worth the visit. Going with children is easy.",
          "One of the most beautiful buildings and courtyards in Europe. Well worth the visit even if you're not all the regious",
          "What an amazing building. Walked all round it and admired it from all sides as well as the beautiful garden.. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Do take time to go in, I am sure it is beautiful.",
          "Like most cathedrals, this one is beautiful and free. We made sure to bring a guide that day because it really made a difference.",
          "Magnifecent Byzantin Church. Is a must if you are in Palermo. Incredible well kept. GREAT!! I was there almost 3 hours. . The Dinasty of the Roggero's were very advanced. The amazing thing for the of 1100. AC. were so advanced that had 4 laguages that were accepted. Greek, Arab,",
          "If you want to climb up to the roof top and enjoy the views, they charge up to 10 euros. Otherwise it\u2019s free to visit the church and well worth your time. Be mindful, no short shorts or bare shoulders. Cover up or you won\u2019t get in. Worse, they may you buy and where a god-awful",
          "We visited last week. It wasn't great. The main cathedral itself is big and not much else and is free to enter, but it has the option to buy tickets together or separately to the royal tombs, crypt, treasury and roof. We did the lot for 10 Euros. When we bought the ticket it",
          "We found Palermo Cathedral during a one day stopover in Palermo as our ship was docked in the port here. We had opted to explore the city on foot and had prepared our own agenda with points of interest to visit. Passing along the Via Vittorio Emanuele we picked up a map with a",

          "I love old town that is why I love Palermo a lot. Don\u2019t miss to visit Cathedral Di Paletmo. I am not a Budhist ,but I love this sacred place a lot.",
          "The interior of the cathedral isn't something interested.The view from the roof is the best.The crypt has many jewels of the Palermo's history.",
          "We saw the main interior and the roof walkway. Amazing views from the roof. I m not amazing with heights but I was ok because the walkway was not near a ledge, more so in the centre of the roof with handrails, was worth it.",
          "A super nice cathedral in the historic centre of Palermo. The cathedral sits inside spacious grounds with plenty of places to sit and enjoy a break from walking around. This was my favourite spot in Palermo. It's near other sights and the adjacent street has a lot of touristy",
          "Cattedrale di Palermo is beautiful. Definitely a place to visit in Palermo. The view from the top is spectacular.",
          "Outstanding Cathedral with layers of different culture influence. The chapels inside are \u201c store in store\u201d type for a church and loaded with beautiful art of all types. The facades are a masterpiece and you don\u2019t get tired of admiring. We visited only the free admission portion",
          "We went with our group and our time was limited-it would have been nice to spend more time especially on the roof with the stunning panoramic views. There is an extra charge to see the artifacts and the crypts. If you have the time, spend the time to see this.",
          "This is a huge and beautiful cathedral, especially the exterior. There is so much detail and so much to look at. We went back at night and it looked very pretty lit up.",
          "Touring this cathedral is a must. The size and buaty alone is worth the trip and the history is a bonus.",
          "Worth time to stop for a short visit. It opens at 8.30am and not many tourists are up yet, at least in June.",
          "A must see when in Palermo, the exterior of this cathedral is one of a kind, all the different architectural styles that have created this gem have been harmoniously combined together during the centuries and left something that you cannot see anywhere else thanks to the many",
          "What a beautiful building, both externally and internally. We were on a street food and historical tour and we arrived just in time to see the sun dial cross the meridian line. Make certain that you see this on your visit.",
          "Lovely building and interior. We didn\u2019t pay to visit the rooftop but worth going to see the inside. There was a lack of information boards in English to educate visitors about each area but there was one about a priest Giuseppe Puglisi who was murdered by the Mafia.",
          "Right in the centre. Loved the statues around it and the roof and crypt. Loved the Norman influence and not just Italian Renaissance architecture",
          "It\u2019s a MUST in Palermo! Well located and close to the Capo district with its amazing street market and delicious street food! It\u2019s a journey into the authenticity of this unique Sicilian capital!",
          "Go see this! A must for your Palermo trip.. And go up and out on the roof.. stunning vistas .. take a walk through the pedestrian area and sample the street food..",
          "Lucky to arrive as a service was starting on Pentecostal. We stayed to experience the service which was lovely, beautiful singing in an amazing building. Recommend a visit and paying to see the priceless artefacts and cript.",
          "A must of course, but the ewhole church was unfortunately ruined in Baroque times, so little remains of the grand Cathedral of Walter of the Mill. The only reason to go it to see the fantastic tombs of thre Norman Kings and the German Emperors.",
          "I\u2019m running out of expletives to describe all of these churches and castles and the artwork we\u2019re seeing through Italy. The cathedral is just another fine example of the importance of the church in early Italian times. See it when you\u2019re there.",
          "A beautiful Cathedral to visit, the views from the top are amazing, as are the underground Crypts. The interior is amazing with the different altars and enclaves to see!",
          "One of my favorite attractions in Palermo, this cathedral is a masterpiece because of the architectural stiles. I recommend you to book a tour and visit the top because the city view is breathtaking.",
          "Palermo's cathedral is amazing...no words to describe it. No matter the weather, in the sun or on a rainy day it is simply amazing! You can't stop staring at it!",
          "You can spend a small fortune paying for the entry fees to Palermo\u2019s churches which seems to be the (irritating) norm here. But the cathedral is majestic even from a distance, especially around dusk. We walked around the premises (which you can enter for free), but most of our",
          "This cathedral blends many styles, and the result is pretty over the top. The inside is immense and gorgeous. On the outside it looks a bit like sandcastles we all made on the beach as kids.",
          "Great example of Ancient Architecture. Beautifull cathedral, well kept. People like to climb the stairs and get the best city views.",
          "We visited the cathedral and were so impressed buy it. Truly worth the visit. It's really spectacular",
          "This building is awesome. We went up to the roof (100 ish spiral steps) but well worth the effort for the view which is stunning. The architecture is fantastic and the inside is breathtaking. Even if you are not religious you cannot help but be overwhelmed with the atmosphere.",
          "Wow. Not only is it one of the most beautiful cathedrals that I\u2019ve ever seen, but the \u20ac8 ticket to see everything is totally worth it. The roof alone provides unmatched views for the city and its surroundings, and also makes for some lovely photos. The crypt is breathtaking,",
          "Nice exterior. Dull interior. Like much of the city it could do with a good clean and made attractive.",
          "Lovely decorative stonework. Roof visit quite good for views over Palermo. Interior had some interesting features too.",
          "I\u2019ve seen a lot of churches and cathedral so this one is OK on the list of what I\u2019ve seen in my travels nothing spectacular however it is very large. You\u2019re in the location you might as well walk through it and visit can\u2019t hurt.",
          "#1 place to visit whilst in Palermo! Architecture from a bygone age!! Norman style that is definitely worth research! Side chapels rival the Vatican! An oasis in a busy city!!",
          "The cathedral is really worth visiting, its square/garden is also beautiful so it is great to have there a short break, too. I highly recommend to go on the roof for only a couple of Euros and enjoy Palermo from above.",
          "A visit to this Cathedral is important when you pair it with the other Norman gem, Monreale to compare. The two Cathedrals were very much in competition with each other. There is no admission cost to enter the church, but a fee is charged to visit the crypts below and to climb",
          "Spectacular. What can I say, the architecture is fantastic. Lovely clean grounds and surroundings. Well worth a visit",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral to visit, stunning to photograph and free to enter. Inside doesn't disappoint and is as sumptuous as any in Italy. There is access to the roof for the brave at heart with the expected stunning views of the city. Set in it's own gardens in the centre",
          "The cathedral of Palermo is a famous landmark. It is free of charge to visit the interior and only a few Euros to go on the rooftop for some nice views. Must see and it takes approx 1h to enjoy it all. Don\u2019t pay to see the crypt and treasury, not worth the money.",
          "The cathedral is an impressiv building. Inside is not so exiting but the view from the roof is worth the 5 EUR. Also lighted in the evening it looks really good.",
          "From outside and inside one of the most impressive monument. You can also walk on the roof for 5 Euro per Person.",
          "Probably the most interesting landmark in Palermo. You should spend some time at the outside too, maybe even more impressive than from the inside.",
          "Like many regions of the south-western Mediterranean, Palermo and Sicily have been on the receiving end of frequent invasions and take-overs. The Cathedral is a classic example of a site with a varied history, as it was originally an early Christian basilica, and then under",
          "Impressive church in the center of town. What makes the architecture so interesting is that it was started in 1185 and after various additions, finished in the eighteenth century. Entrance fee can be up to \u20ac10, but on Sunday\u2019s one can only walk on the roof for \u20ac5. Impressive",
          "Amazing structure - huge, delicate and beautiful. Impressive to look at and see all the structural changes made over centuries. The outside is much more beautiful than the inside of the cathedral.",
          "The cattedrale is definetly the top site in Palermo. The exterior when viewed for the first time is breathtaking but comparing to Rome, Florence, Venice or Milan it is nothing much to mention. It is large and dramatic but not beautiful nor noteworthy on any count. it is just",
          "The Cathedral of Palermo is one of the few monuments to visit during a short stay in Palermo. In the purest Arab-Norman style, the building dates from the twelfth century, as a whole, while the nave was later reworked during the Baroque period.",
          "We are always delighted by these grand cathedrals. A real testament to the faith of the people who contributed to building these wonderful structures.",
          "I believe this is one of the most important sites not to miss in Palermo! The cathedral is immense and well preserved. You can pay a couple of euros for an extended tour and the possibility to go on the dome of the cathedral. Recommended",
          "A unique example of Norman-Arab architecture, a world heritage sight with every reason. The outside is far more interesting than the inside. Don't miss it!",
          "Loved walking around inside and out. Nicely maintained building , unfortunately missed the tour as we arrived too late - would have liked to do this!",
          "Amazing place BUT nothing compared to the Monreale's one. Trust me: visit this cathedral than run to Monreale. Also Cefal\u00f9's one is nothing compared to Monreale's one. Go to Monreale! Clear enough?",
          "Nice Cattedrale and is definitely worth to visit. When we were there a big group of tourists just entered, so we stayed just for ten minutes. They also provide some walking tours on the roof.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral. The outside when you first see it is a wow. Inside is impressive but not the most in this town.",
          "Interesting and beautiful. Looks a lot bigger from the outside than when you get inside. Some great ceilings and altars.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral that you have to visit.. Standing also from the outside. Beautiful view from the roof but you have to pay 5\u20ac to go and if you want to visit the tresury and tomps 3\u20ac more euros needed!",
          "Beautiful cathedral, very interesting. Contains the grave of the priest assassinated by the mafia. Over the road enjoyed a freshly squeezed pomegranate juice.",
          "Palermo is home to many very beautiful churches. This Roman Catholic cathedral-church, Palermo Cathedral, is the largest and most magnificent. The exterior is very ornate and the interior even more magnificent. Parts of the present day cathedral were built in the 12th, 14th,",
          "The Cathedral is free to enter and it is surrounded by lovely grounds. There are several architectural styles and the exterior was perhaps even more beautiful than the interior (not as spectacular as the Cappella Palatina or the Duomo in Monreale). We did not pay to walk up to",
          "The Palermo Cathedral is a mixture of several architectural styles, and so was fascinating to visit, I'm sorry we didn't have time to go up to the roof. The tomb of a priest executed by the Mafia in 1993 is also located in the cathedral - a reminder of the Mafia violence that",
          "This cathedral looks amazing from outside, amazing architecture and a beautiful entrance. The inside of the cathedral didn\u2019t blow me away(we visited so many cathedrals along our journeys that we became a bit picky) but impressive as all the mighty cathedrals. But the rooftop is",
          "Maybe it is the most important and biggest historical structure in thr city. The building was built by differebt emperors so each added some new parts. Thats why the cathedral has different architectural contexts in one. Worth to visit and you can go top of cathedral to watch",
          "It is a top 3 on the list of places to see here. The beauty and history is beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s truly not to be missed. Go during a service but please be respectful. Gorgeous!",

          "This is one of the top 50 cathedrals of Europe. If you haven't seen your fill, or enjoy church and history, certainly visit. The price is essentially free to view the building with a very reasonable 3 euros for a inside look at rarely seen extensive underground crypts and church",
          "The cattedrale di Palermo is one the historic sites in Palermo that can not be missed. It is a nice building that offers different options in the form of tours. Particularly I think it is a bit overpriced and, despite being nice inside it is nothing special when compared to",
          "The cathedral is huge and a landmark. Do not forget to buy tickets (think Euro 5 per person) which grant access to the rooftop. Amazing view. The insides are ok.",
          "The cathedrale itself is a must see but for 5euros go on the top to get an overview of Palerme and the mountains around !!",
          "The Norman cathedral was built on the site of a Muslim mosque in the 12th century to rival the cathedral at Monreale. The external architecture is stunning and it is worth walking all the way round rather than just viewing it from the gardens in front. Having visited some of the",
          "I loved the outside of the cathedral. The big square in front of the side entrance gives you a wonderful view. The inside however is rather plain, and you can easily drop entering (and paying) without messing much.",
          "It's a beautiful cathedral, although not as interesting inside as some others. We went in the evening, and the exterior was breathtaking with the lighting from the sunset.",
          "In this Monumental Cathedral where several kings were crowned, it has in its interior the Chapel with the relics of Santa Rosalia and the beautiful lapizlazuli chapel of the Santisimo Sacramento and on the floor of the central nave are the signs of the zodiac. Do not miss seeing",
          "The place is very nice. You can take a tour on the roof, wich is great. Thats about 5 euro per adult. You can also try a tour in the crypt. I don't really know how much that costs. I think they have a website with their prices. Still, the roof view is restricted. You can't walk",
          "We have been to a few different cathedrals in Europe so we wanted to visit this one also. Very beautiful inside. You can take the roof tour for 5 euros, but since we are on the top floor of a condo with a very large veiw of the city, we opted out. However, there we tons of",
          "This is such a beautiful Cattedrale. Beautiful design on the walls and a wonderful nativity. We did the roof tour and you walk up many steps to the top of the roof and the views are amazing! It\u2019s a must see.",
          "Full of different architectural styles Norman, Arab, great history and a little atmosphere including tomb of Frederick II a must visit in Palermo",

          "Even if you have had a lot of visits to cathedrals do not miss this one. It is hige, impressive and full of history",
          "A must see when visiting Palermo. The inside of the cathedral but for sure the walk up the roof to see the panoramic view over the city. The cathedral is the outcome of a mixture of different roman, Norman, gothic, arabic and baroc architecture.",
          "The cathedral is one of the first things to do when you visit Palermo! The exterior is very impressive and it is influenced by Arabs,Spanish and Byzantines who consequently has occupied Palermo in the past. Inside it looks like a typical renaissance architecture and it has",
          "The architecture of the place is outstanding and the garden beautiful. However, the price to visit this place is too high related to what it offers. There isn't even a caffe where you can sit and relax.",
          "Amazing mix of cultures in only one place , too much history and the inside of the church we\u2019ll conserved",
          "Free and easy to tour on your own. Very little in English descriptions. There are parts that there is an additional fee but we did not participate in that area",
          "The Cattedrale di Palermo is a must when visiting Sicily. the square is perfect for meditation and a short break from walking.",
          "We bought the 8 euro tour which included the rooftop, the treasures, the crypt snd the catacombs. An amazing cathederal, but my favourity part was the rooftop and the view. Never found the catacombs.",
          "Very unusual and stunning silver altar, domed ceilings with extravagant frescoes. One side chapel holds a series of ancient crypts. Very worthwhile stop.",
          "Beautiful exterior, but don\u2019t expect the same feeling of amazement when you enter because the interior has a neo-classical design. If you want to see breath-taking interior art, go to Monreale Cathedral, which is the opposite of Palermo Cathedral.",
          "Visited today. It is very beautiful inside with a lot of treasures. To enter the cathedral is free but they charge for everything, the treasury, going to the roof.",
          "Nice from outside despite critical carping about the dome (which doesn't truly fit but what in Palermo is of one era ?). Tombs + crypt interesting. Cathedral interior less so. An hour without roof. Maybe one to 2 with. Treasury artefacts interesting but limited. A few star",
          "A must when you visit Palermo. Try to circle the area and see from different ankles and views, there are several hints of this spot.",
          "I fell in love with the exterior of the Palermo cathedral. Could have stared at it for hours. The interior is also nice. We climbed up to the roof and the dome. Keep in mind that the steps are rather high and somehow difficult to climb up and you might also feel pressure to",
          "What a building! Not to be missed while on a visit to palermo. Truly magnificent. We visited in October, so there weren\u2019t too many tourists.",
          "A must see in Palermo. The pillars, mosaics, paintings, the building's magnificence by it self......",
          "I found the exterior very interesting but the interior bizarrely soulless I guess fair when you consider it's been rebuilt so many times. A great place to shelter from the rain",
          "We visited this ornate cathedral only for the short time that our Globus tour allowed. So much history here that it was hard to take it all in! The tomb of Blessed Giuseppe Puglisi is located in one of the side chapels. This priest was martyred by the Mafia 20 years ago for",
          "Not the best cathedral I've ever been to but not the worst by any means. We went to the roof up narrow stone stairs. Don't go up if you are claustrophobic. It's either all the way up in one go or not at all. No escape. The view is ok but I've seen better roof views. The",
          "Unsurprisingly given the look of this building outside, this cathedral started out as a mosque. Some of the towers are original from the 11th century, and it always fascinates me when buildings are that old. Inside, the cathedral is quite tame in terms of decoration. You can buy",
          "What a view. The facade and the gardens of this baroque, Norman cathedral is breathtaking. The interiors are less impressing, but once in Palermo you cannot miss it",
          "This cathedral is beautiful inside and out. It is in a great part of the town and very popular with shops and restaurants nearby.",
          "I loved the beautiful Cattedrale. I wish had more time to complete the tower and roof tour. Simply stunning.",
          "Really enjoyed the cathedral, part of the major attraction in Palermo. Take time and have a good look around. The roof tour is amazing.",
          "We visited the cathedral yesterday and found it to be well worth the effort and price. The main cathedral is beautiful and free of charge. The is an 8\u20ac charge for access to the rooftop, treasury, tombs and crypt. However, on the day of our visit only the tombs and rooftop were",
          "What an amazing place! Don't forget to take the roof tour, very steep winding steps, but well worth the effort! Fabulous views inside and of course from the roof!",
          "Beautiful architecture but not much inside ! Worth a visit and good views from top of the cathedral.",
          "Interesting cathedral - got up to roof - saw the tombs and treasury etc. Enjoyed the visit but visitor info is very patchy, no guide pamphlets appeared available - occasional signs in English but hit or miss. Not cheap Go because you should but don\u2019t necessarily pay for the",
          "This was a nice cathedral but there was so many beautiful churches in this city. Crypt was interesting but had to pay extra for this. Roof visit has 120 steep steps and is only about 13 meters long so is full of visitors.this is open only every 30 min. Pay just left of entrance.",
          "The best thing about this cathedral is the walk around the outside. Views are wonderful, architecture is superb. Inside - well, it\u2019s OK but compared with the building is relatively modern. Look out for the toilets! The door is hidden in a chapel behind a monumental marble altar!",
          "Very nice cathedral in the middle of a pedestrian area. Nice front garden. You can go upstairs and have a wonderful view of Palermo roofs. More spectacular is inside rather than outside.",
          "While it has a very pretty exterior the interior and alter are nothing spectacular. Since it is free to visit it was worth entering simply to check it out. It was a great way to get out of the rain for 30 minutes.",
          "As I said in the title the Cathedral is amazing in the outside but is nothing special in the inside. So I suggeste the visitors to come visit because it is a very important place for Palermo but don't aspect anything special in the inside. No parking places anywhere close.",
          "Visited the Cathedral which is free to enter and walk around. If you want to climb to the roof of the Cathedral there is a small charge \u20ac6 there are quite a few stairs in a winding turret with a hand rail...we chose to go at the back of the group so we could go up at our own",
          "I have been to many Cathedrals over the years. They are all pretty much the same. We read the information from our guide book and didn't bother with the audio. Good view from the roof.",
          "We met our guide here for a half day walking tour. It was a great place to start as there was space for us to sit while she went over the basics of a very complicated history. There were lots of places around the cathedral where she could illustrate a point she was making. And",
          "A wonderful place great architecture with some stunning statues on a bright sunny day in sat outside here admiring the view and the busy town centre behind you",
          "Do not waste time waiting in coffee shop to be served. Waitress was ignorant unfriendly and dismissive. Left after 15 minutes \ud83d\ude1e",
          "This large cathedral has had many additions over the centuries which explains the different styles of architecture. Because of Sunday Mass, we could only tour part of the church but what we saw was beautiful. Would love to go back and complete the tour.",
          "The outside of the cathedral is amazing - and worth looking at it from all sides as the end view (from the right-hand end as you look at the front - is also magnificent. Inside, the cathedral is surprisingly simple, but still fantastic.",
          "The building is a real mish mash of styles built up over the centuries but inside you could be in any 17th or 18th century church. We did not stay long",
          "I just agree with all that everything that\u2019s been said already. Very narrow staircase but well worth the climb.",
          "As it was closed on the date of our visit, we could not go inside. However, even seeing the cathedral from outside is wonderful.",
          "We visited the Cathedral a day after the Pope left Palermo so there was a lot of excitement around the area. A visit to the roof is a must just for the view, also the architecture. Also visit the Tombs and Treasury.",
          "Loved it. Beautiful cathedral, crypts downstairs are interesting, the view from the roof is fantastic! Pay the \u20ac8 and you won\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s a narrow staircase up, but it is so lovely. You are given a time to go up, so no mad rush or long wait (we only had to wait 20mins",
          "much plainer than expected (with the exception of the silver alter) but go up on the roof and look at the views - they are stunning - you can also do this at night with the Gregorian chants",
          "The cathedral is far more impressive from the outside than from the inside but it is still worth going inside if only to find the most original place for a lavatory in any church I have encountered...namely behind one of the smaller altars/chapels. Very good if one has to go and",
          "A grand beautiful Cathedral but nothing to separate it from many of the others.I found the Baroque churches in the town center more unusual and interesting.",
          "Fabulous and impressive building that dominates the area and provides a great photographic opportunity.",
          "A must when visiting Palermo this historic city has a lot to see. The Cattedrale de Palermo is one of them.. Expected to spend many hours here and take many pictures. The building is so photogenic and full of statues inside one out.. If feeling adventurous for a few euro\u2019s a",
          "The Cathedral opened its doors at night during the summer. Good view from the roof area but the security fight give you much standing time to really savour the views - everyone just really marched up had a quick look and had to keep the queue moving. Plus the information",
          "We only purchased the ticket for the view from the roof of the cathedral. The interior of the cathedral and the catacombs are also supposed to be lovely but we did not have enough time. Think realistically about the 110 spiral steps climb. Each step is 12 to 14 inches tall. They",
          "This was the first important historical building we saw in Palermo, so a good encounter. We did not take the tour, but admired the architecture and the courtyard.",
          "We walked by here and absolutely loved it. It dates back to the 18th century. Worth the walk to come see it.",
          "Fantastic architecture and consider the age of the building. Powerful modern sculpture in the front puts the bishops in their place",
          "Wonderful cathedral Delighted to have been there Incrediblely hot day Bring water Lovely place really worth seeing",
          "Review only for the roof. You have to pay a few euros (3-5\u20ac) to visit the roof of the cathedral for 30-45 minutes. You get a nice view over the rooftops of Palermo and the surrounding landscape. Maybe you have to wait if there is another group on the roof.",
          "I happened to walk past this and found the exterior to be very nice for a stop and photos. You do have to contend with the poor street dogs and teens sitting around playing music. I didn\u2019t go in so no comment there.",
          "This is a large and decorated cathedral which are all over Italy and Europe for that matter. Worth the time to see it but it does get crowded and the roof tour and crypt cost extra.",
          "The dominating building of the wonderful city of Palermo, an extraordinary fusion of Moorish, Norman and Christian architecture. If you visit the city, you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t miss it. Unforgettable.",
          "Just like most Sicily towns the main Cathedral are a site to see. This applies here. Surrounding building are worth the visit to see. And on main shopping tourist street.",
          "Really nice building, as we are lovers of history, we have visit this place. My hubby even paid the fee to go on the roof.",
          "Well worth the entrance fee. The roof view is stunning. Be prepared to walk up several flights of a winding staircase. The crypt and the treasure room are also well worth seeing.",
          "Fantastic energy feeling place .Do not miss the chance to take a tour on the roof . this is spectacular !",
          "The silverworks in the front of the church are magnificent. The exterior facade is very detailed and beautiful.",
          "A must visit site in Palermo full of amazing and historical relics. Full of tourists too, so visit early or later in the day.",
          "We simply did the roof top tour of the cathedral which was one of various charges tours you can do of the cathedral. You can for instance do a tour of the crypts but you see a video of it whilst you are waiting and it didn\u2019t seem worth it! The views from the top are really",
          "The cathedral is an impressive and very old building in central Palermo. Make sure you do a tour to the roof, which gives panoramic views over the city, and also go down to the crypt to view the very old coffins (dated 1100's to 1500's). Definitely worth a visit if you have time",
          "As we approached the Cathedral it was stunning Norman building, but less interesting on the interior. Free admission but worth paying the extra to climb the steps to the roof and walk the length of it.",
          "Wonderful cathedral, impressive architecture inside and outside,full of history , not to be missed. One of the most visited sites in Palermo.",
          "This lovely Catherdral is a hive of activity as the community attends services and conducts weddings here. Pay the extra fee and visit the tidy and historic crypt. We were the only visitors in the crypt and climbing to the top and across the buttress for a great view of the",
          "Palermo doesn't disappoint the architecture is stunning and so was the Cathedral. We had passed by a few times and not stopped due to queues. Need to make sure shoulders and knees are covered to be respectful Visited on a quieter day and found the Cathedral was beautiful with",
          "Catholic Cathedral of Palermo, dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary. Made of a number of different styles due to extensions through the ages. Dating back to the 12th century it was founded by Pope Gregory. It contains sacred vestments, jewellery and artefacts from the past",
          "Begun by the Normans and built over several hundred years, this cathedral is impressive inside and out. There are layers of design, including Arab elements, but it somehow all works together.",
          "Sicily's heritage is reflected across the outside of this great cathedral, from the Norman architecture to remaining Arab writings on several columns in the main entrance, and to the Spanish Baroque dome. The interior is comparatively unadorned vs. other churches in Palermo",
          "Beautiful cathedral with many features. We bought the 8 euro ticket to climb to the roof, see the crypt and view the treasury artifacts which were all worth seeing. The climb to the roof is up a narrow winding staircase so if you're not fit, suffer from vertigo or claustrophobia",
          "Having maybe visited the Norman Palatine Chapel in Palermo and the Norman Cathedral at Monreale, you probably expect to walk into the Norman Cathedral and see the same amazing covering of every square inch of surface with decoration in a mainly Byzantine style. Well, this",
          "A really amazing place of worship, the building is large and well maintained. You pay extra for a tour of the roof and the crypts.",
          "The Cathedral of Palermo mixes Arab and Norman architecture and it really works. The exterior is beautiful and the inside is awesome. The silver chapel to the patron saint of Palermo is drop dead gorgeous. This is a MUST see. Free admission.",
          "There are so many churches and cathedral but this one is very beautiful even from the outside. Very picturesque. The cathedral itself is free to enter and sit there looking onto its altar. The walk round had various little niches with all sorts of picture's there is also a",
          "Well worth a visit if you are in Palermo (we walked there from our cruise ship). The outside is very impressive and you can go into the main part for free. Out of respect you need to cover your shoulders. I took a little cardigan with me in my hand bag \u2013 but I noticed that",
          "The exterior of the cathedral is spectacular and not to be missed. The interior is rather disappointing especially after the splendor of Monreale and Palatine Chapel",
          "The exterior of the cathedral is well worth exploring -- it is a romanesque mastepiece. The later interior is to my taste disappointing, but the tombs of the Norman kings are a remarkable sight not to be missed",
          "Thy have a dress code in the summer. The man in charge of the door only applies it to non Italians. Try any type of reasoning and he\u2019ll just be rude and mean to you. The option they give you to go inside if he decides you can\u2019t is buying a 1\u20ac piece of cloth...",
          "A very impressive sight, large open area in front of cathedral always plenty of photo opportunities. Gets very busy on Sundays, watched a wedding. Nice bars at the side entrance for beer and ice-cream.",
          "There is lots to gawk at - both from the exterior and interior. But do not miss the terrace upstairs, from which you will get fantastic views of the city.",
          "Amazing stories to this church, tour guide of Palermo would be good Wonderful little piazza outside Worth visiting very near shopping precinct, wear comfortable shoes and take plenty of photos",
          "The cathedral is rated now as a place number 20 to visit in Palermo, which is probably underestimation since it has unique architecture, history, easy parking nearby, tour to the roof, etc.",
          "One of must sees in Palermo. Looks great from the outside. Interior though is not spectacular. Taking roof tour makes sense.",
          "Stunning building absolutely worth going see and the little roads surrounding are great to walk down and see the small shops",
          "Exterior of the cathedral is very fascinating. It has a big garden and square in front of it. It is extremely long but not that furnished interiors. Its brick walls are like art pieces. I liked it very much. And strongly recommend anyone who visits Palermo.",
          "The roofs of this beautiful building are occasionally opened to the public , I recommend a visit if you are in town when they are opened. Stairs up are a little tight obviously but not too bad , I am not comfortable with small spaces and heights but i could handle it fine. The",
          "Nothing special, the roof is very narrow and the views are not spectacular as you can only see the centre",
          "We were completely in awe of this amazing Cathedral in the centre of Palermo. This is a place that visitors must see when in the city to appreciate the rich history of Palermo.",
          "The outside of the Cathedral is beautiful, the layout of the area and the fact that it is so well maintained make it all the more special. We visited the Cathedral around mid-day and it was obvious that they were preparing for a wedding. This enhanced the excitement of our",
          "Wow well worth the walk. Breath taking views. Great building filled with history and venerable facts. A spectacle on Palermo. Just an amazing place to visit.",
          "In the historical center of Palermo: this Norman cathedral is a must see attraction. Nice garden around and some stone bench to rest.",
          "Buy the ticket for the roof only as the royal tombs are not worth it. The view from the rooftop is great though. There are many steps to climb and only small groups are allowed to go up at a time. The outside is beautiful though the inside somewhat disappointing.",
          "Interesting cathedral - a shame we did not get to see the Norman tombs but the rest was fascinating. A good hour to spend.",
          "Unusual inside - a mix of different architecture! 8 euros allows you onto the roof, into the crypt and morselium. Not that big, but well worth the money. The main church is free to visit - need to dress appropriately, if not cover ups are sold for a euro.",
          "If you do have the displeasure of coming to Palermo, then the only nice thing you can visit is this. It's beautiful.",
          "Me and my partner visited the beautiful Cathedral. We took the open roof tour. Sadly, I agreed my shorts were too short for the dress code and purchased a 1 euro cover up. However, it soon became clear that others had not followed this rule - in fact over 75 percent of people.",
          "Visited in May..our air bnb apartment was directly opposite this magnificent cathedral. Very beautiful inside..worth paying for the visit to the royal tombs, and the rooftop walk.",
          "Not much to see on the inside, but a stunning building....make sure you walk all the way round to spot the Byzantine influences...and perhaps pay your 5 euros to climb to the top for some great views!",
          "Free tickes to visit the church. It looks amazing outside and inside. One of the most beautiful churches in the world.",
          "There are thousands of churches in Palermo - and they can't all be fascinating, but the architecture of this one is interesting. However the interior is disappointing. Leaving aside the Royal tombs, and the silver altar to Sante Rosaria, there is little else to see. It's",
          "Really worth a visit! Superb architecture and most unusual. We loved it and highly recommended it to all.",
          "The architecture outside is so nice but when you visit inside the cathedral it\u2019s not very very beautiful as outside. Worth a visit!",
          "This stunning cathedral is free to go into, unless you want to climb up the dome to see the view of the city. It is a beautiful cathedral, containing many treasures of enamels, jewellery, sculptures and engravings. When walking by, you just have to pop in. As with most places",
          "The most beautiful cathedral ever seen. You really can feel Sicilian people\u2019s faith (at least what remained) Bring a long trouser or a skirt. No visible knees and shoulders allowed at the cathedral but at least it\u2019s free to visit.",
          "We did not go to the roof but still thought both the building and the interior were above average and should be a mandatory visit if in Palermo. Its close to all the markets, the Palentine chappel and the Quattro Canti",
          "Free entry, though if you\u2019re wearing short shorts or a vest top, you may well be charged a euro for a wrap. Cathedral is fairly large, and definitely worth a visit. The catacombs & roof are charged for. We didn\u2019t do these, it think it was about \u20ac7 per person.",
          "This huge cathedral was erected in 1185 and after many restorations and additions has many different architectural styles: Norman, Moorish, Gothic, Baroque and Neoclassical. Many kings and nobles were buried here. Entry is free of charge.",
          "This place embodies the history of Palemro and Sicily in general. Best part is the view from the dome.",
          "We went into the cathedral not knowing what to expect. It is beautiful and well worth a visit if you decide to pay for a trip up on the roof. The view over Palermo from the roof is spectacular.",
          "Nice place to take a break towards the top of the tourist route. Seating was available to rest your feet and take the sights in, before you go on the roof walk! The only place we had beggars in Palermo - actually inside.",
          "The cathedral is a top attraction in Palermo, but mainly for it's spectacular medieval exterior in the unique Arab-Norman style of this part of Sicily. The interior has been remade to look like most of the grand papal basilicas in Rome and have lost all of its medieval feeling.",
          "The place really worth seeing. Don't forget to go to the top of it to the dome. The view over Palermo is absolutely gorgeous and unforgettable. Beata",
          "Well worth a visit...an excellent building with impressive sculptures and other works of art. It is on a local bus route so easily accessed. You can also explore the high roof areas.",
          "Visited for the first time. What a gem. A true and absolute MUST to see place while in Sicily. Beautiful altars towers and scenery that you would expect from a high tier church.",
          "A beautiful cathedral full of history. The architecture is stunning and the inside reminded me of Baroque churches in England. It's definitely worth spending the 7\u20ac to visit the roof to get panoramic views of the city, as well as the crypt and treasury.",
          "Impressive 12th century church. Free entry to the main building but it will cost you quite abit if you want to access the more interesting areas including the roof. Worth a look if you aren't yet totally over churches.",
          "This is one of the places you have to visit during your stay in Palermo. Check the working hours before you go there",
          "Beautiful, impressive- one of the few places which city of Palermo is taking care of. To see the inside you need to cover your knees and shoulders!",
          "The piazza around this cathedral gives you great views of the architecture. The high spot (excuse the pun) is the rooftop walk which gives you spectacular views of Palermo and the surrounding countryside.",
          "A wonderful exterior and square, a great place to admire, the interior is quite plain compared to Dome Monreale but then again many places would be.",
          "Not much to see on the inside of this cathedral, especially if you have already been to Palatine Chapel and Monreale. The outside is very impressive however. The cathedral is free to enter but you can pay extra to climb the exterior roof and see some of the people buried here",
          "The visit of the cathedral in Palermo was the highlight of our visit. The architecture is breathtaking and one can spend a lot of time there, just absorbing the atmosphere. It is possible to go up to the roof, which we slipped, because it was simply too hot.",
          "We payed 7 Euro to visit the roof (which has set times during the day approx. Every 30 mins or so) has a great view of the city and you could see the cool coloured tiles on the roof... it was hot up there so take a hat. The 7 Euro also included the treasure room and the crypt",
          "Amazing history and architecture. Make sure that you visit the museum after you have seen the Cathedral. Plan on at least 3 hours there. Stay away from the restaurants surrounding the Cathedral as they are all tourist ripoff places with dubious food. If you walk just 5-10",
          "The Cathedral is a must see sight I Palermo. The splendour of the age when it was built is in full view here for all to witness. On entering to your left is the ticket office, Once you have your ticket you move into the waiting area for the roof tour. Here while waiting you will",
          "Brilliant external architecture and stunning internal details but the busiest spot in Palermo. There are quiet areas for contemplation as well as an amazing organ. Worth braving the crowds.",
          "The walk on the roof is the best thing here. Inside the cathedral is good for sheltering from the heat. The exterior is impressive.",
          "Beautiful palace well worth seeing, glorious gardens also, quite a relaxed atmosphere, Would certainly recommend a visit.",
          "The exterior is more impressive than the interior. The exterior is also lit beautifully at night. We had no issues or concerns in walking the streets in the vicinity of the cathedral at night.",
          "The interior was nice but nothing to write home about. The exterior, however, was a site to behold. The various architectural influences apparent were truly fascinating to look at. You can also get tickets to go up tot he roof.",
          "One cannot visit Palermo without visiting this beautiful cathedral, its huge! The grounds and interior are well kept and worth a tour around. Yhey have lovely rosaries you can have blessed and keepsakes. I bought one with lovely small roses which she prays to every day. Enjoy",
          "Incredible Cathedral with amazing architecture!! Great felling while inside. Located at an area with some good cafes",
          "The architecture on the outside is amazing. The best way to take all in, is to walk around the cathedral. The inside is totally different to that of the Vatican. It is all white and completely clinical inside. If you love cathedrals, it is well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing view from the outside, wouldnt recommend going inside, there is not much to see inside......",
          "This is best seen by walking the whole way round outside and appreciating the Normal architecture. Inside nothing is left, just lifeless later makeovers. You can enter for free but the \"specials\" are not worth it. The treasury is a sorry affair - the Constanza crown is poorly",
          "A true gem .. such a mixture of architecture is a delight to see under one roof . A visit at night is recommended where you have the choice to have a walk round the roof tops amist bell towers and coupolas..",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral externally and you get fantastic views from the roof (beware spiral steps with not always a handrail) but internally it is rather austere. Didn't go to the tombs.",
          "This is a must to visit, fantastic example of construction. You can visit right up to the top, on the roof, and from there you can see all the city of Palermo and take some stunning photos!",
          "From the main hall to the crypt and the roof, this was a personal favourite of mine on our trip and well worth the time and money invested into seeing it all!",
          "Go with stairs aside, up on the roof - what a magnificent view to the whole city! Visiting it on Saturday may enable you to witness wedding too.",
          "It is worth to visit. I always love big old churches. I recommend everybody to go inside for at least 15 minutes.",
          "Beautiful cathedral and plaza with an atmospheric crypt full or tombs we (sadly!) found so interesting we spent a quarter hour reading the inscriptions. Upstairs it was perfect, after hearing about Roger everywhere, to see his tomb, only \u20ac2 for this and the crypt/treasures.",
          "Go early to avoid bus loads of tourists - interesting to compare with other Cathedrals in Sicily - went to 3 and this one rates as number 2.",
          "If you love history and looking at beautiful churches it's a place to go. It was a wonderful time. Worth the time to visit.",
          "Very majestic and I was in awe. The walk there is through some questionable areas and when you turn a corner and come upon the Cathedral it is an amazing site.",
          "We just came back from a 10 day vacation in Sicily. While in Palermo we visit the beautiful cathedral twice. It is a great work of art that requires several hours to see properly. You can take a tour or you can visit on your own. You can climb the tower whic gives you a",
          "Cattedrale di Palermo is a huge and stunning building. You should not miss this place during your stay in Palermo. It is beautiful from outside. Inside is not as amazing as outside, but still fine. You can pay to climb the dome, but the scene is not so impressive. You can visit",
          "This is a very impressive looking building on the outside and large inside. It is not as elaborate inside as the one at Montreale just up the mountain outside Palermo. It is worth a visit as it is one of the grand buildings in Palermo.",
          "We approached the cathedral from the back and found it quite stunning with a very moorish appearance. Inside the building is less remarkable but does have a couple of lovely chapels. From the front the exterior is even better.",
          "After travelling for a while, cathedrals start to get a little boring. Palermo\u2019s cathedrals are typical examples of that era and worth a visit while your walking the city.",
          "Here's why you go to Palermo..This amazing cathedral is almost overwhelming in its size and unique Arab-Norman architecture. The current church began construction in 1185, but it was really built on ruins of an earlier church which was turned into a mosque by the Saracens in the",
          "Grand exterior, with a lovely plaza in front. Nothing special inside. Very popular with tourists visiting Palermo.",
          "Very serene setting stunning stained glass one of the most beautiful cathedrals I\u2019ve seen my 17 year old granddaughter who does not do churches was very impressed",
          "We had an ok view from the rooftop. Nothing special but not to bad really. Wasn't overly impressed inside as religion isn't my thing. But the architecture of the structure is amazing to see.",
          "Simply amazing! The architecture detail of the building is just amazing. We didn\u2019t go to the top of the roof but I am sure the View must be incredible.",
          "The paintings on the dome ceiling draw a deeper look. The right-hand alcove has two marble relief sculptures and an ornate altar all in silver. This is the cathedral\u2019s gem. No fee to simply walk through. The treasures and the catacombs are extra, but we did not stay for these.",
          "View from the rooftop is amazing and it was worth climbing. Besides that, it's nice example of combination of different architecture styles. Worth of visiting.",
          "What's interesting here is the adaptation of the earlier architectural motifs..the EXTERIOR more interesting than inside!",
          "Our first glimpse of the cathedral was from a small back street from Teatro Massimo which gives on to the incredible view of the back of the church (ie behind the nave). Not many people walk round there from the front square but it\u2019s definitely worth it! The main entrance is",
          "It very nice castle and church in best part if Palermo,very big building with so many great places around.",
          "The catacombs were fascinating. The walk across the Cathedral roof provided incredible views of Palermo. The Cathedral itself is a nice place to sit and contemplate.",
          "An absolute gem of a cathedral with some of the most beautiful artwork and intricate sculptures hidden inside. Worth a visit and worth going on the tour to see the great views of the city from the roof top.",
          "A stunning church, but the best bit is the 100 steps climb to the roof. Well worth it, amazing panorama views over the whole of Palermo.",
          "If you come from the outskirts of Palermo through the narrow alleys with 90% immigrants you suddenly see this absolute amazing building showing the contrast between now and then. A definite must see!",
          "Among Italy's many churches, Palermo Cathedral isn't among the top ranking few, yet it is a very attractive building that taps into Norman, Arab, Gothic and various other styles",
          "We found it disappointing, probably expected too much but we've visited a few over the years. Very little info in anything other than Italian, no option for audio devices offered so difficult to understand any of the significance of the items",
          "Do whatever you like, but be sure to visit the Palermo cathedral. Too large, too rich to describe in few words, it must be one of the most beautiful churches in the world. You can also take a walk on its top, to enjoy breathtaking views of the city.",
          "The cathedral is a rather unexpected building, different to what you have seen in other places and this is true for the inside and outside. Do not forget to have a look at the back facade which has very special decorations.",
          "Another awesome cathedral but this one is unique in its architectural cultural values of a mix of norman, moorish, gothic, baroque, neoclassical influences. Outstanding and well worth \u201canother church visit\u201d. Don\u2019t let this one pass.",

          "The Palermo Cathedral was begun in the 12th century but not finished until the 18th! That makes the architecture kind of a mishmash. You enter through the stunning 16th century portico. It is free. The interior is decorated in the Baroque style. One of the most interesting",

          "We were lucky enough that this building, when light up at night, was the view from our bedroom window. The building is enormous and a fitting size for a town like Palermo. It is monumental size and design. Interesting history and structual differences to other Italian Churches.",

          "It's easy to get a bit blas\u00e9 with all the superb religious art and architecture in Sicily. I was particularly impressed by the cathedral's crypt, which contained a number of stone caskets (sarcophagi?). These objects were of various ages, and with various degrees of",

          "We visited on a Sunday afternoon but it was closed so check opening times before you visit. There are lots of tours available, bookable inside. We chose the roof tour 5 euros, and when you eventually climb to the top (quite arduous if your not very fit) you are rewarded with",
          "Amazing from the outside. Incredible representation of architecture from 1170 AD. It is a wonder, the pride and workmanship never ceases to impress me here. Inside, the standout is the exquisite use of silver and artwork throughout the cathedral. The blend of Arabic and Norman",

          "You can see it from far away. The outlook is great and huge. Inside is simple than I expected. But the museum have a lot of things to see.",
          "The cathedral is a chimera of architecture, shown off beautifully against the backdrop blue sky with the sun shining on it throughout the day. It is worth studying the norman towers, catalan porch, cupolas and turrets. Yet the whole structure works. Less interesting inside",
          "The cathedral is beautiful! The alters are gorgeous. The silver one is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Pictures don't do it justice. The climb to the top was well worth it to see the view of the city.",
          "Beautiful architecture and had a very nice miniature replica in the church. The silver statue was impressive.",

          "This is a massive structure, and it has been fully restored on the outside. A combination of the architecture from the many ruling cultures, it is a marvel. Climbing the long spiral staircase to the roof was a treat. We could see the many structures sitting on the top of the",

          "If you're a history lover it's the right place for you. Arab norman Palermo is full of attractions like this one. Great and fascinating from the outside, with a beautiful square, a little disappointing inside. Been there twice. Don't miss a chance to see it while in Palermo.",
          "You can tell the influences of the various inhabitants of Sicily just by examining the architecture of the cathedral. From the Norman towers to the Catalan porch and the muslim influence on the mosaics. An impressive structure. Worth a short visit",
          "The modern interior contrasts sharply with the astonishing facade. There are some stunning Arab-Norman tombs, a wonderful treasury and beautiful shrines. A particular favourite of mine was the modern pulpit.",

The cathedral also put in me in mind of the cathedral in Seville. It\u2019s",
          "Its a cathedral, you seen one you've seem em all. This one is pretty good as they go, so I suggest it is a must see",

          "I wandered past this building while walking around Palermo. I have to say I didn't go inside, I was happy just to look at the facade. The location is lovely and easy to find. The building is well worth seeing. I also spent my lunch break sitting next to it, very peaceful and",
          "The plazza in front of the cathedral is quite pleasant and relaxing, the cathedral fa\u00e7ade as well, since it is an aggregate of many styles. But the interior is cold and uninteresting compared to other churches in Palermo",
          "The cattedrale is a must see. The ornate interior displays a sense of pride in workmanship. The columns tell a story",

          "The cathedral is very big, and architectural styles is different. This is point of attraction. You could find bizantin style, moors or baroque. Very nice portico in front of entrance. Inside for me the best was the wooden roof, nice sculptured. You cant miss the Palermo",

          "This is a beautiful cathedral. It used to be covered in mosaics like Monreale but was changed by the Normans but you still get a glimpse of how it would have looked. The cathedral teaches you a lot about the history of the city, particularly the Arab invasion. An absolute must.",

          "The Cathedral in Palermo is definitely worth a visit. The architecture is amazing. The steeples and facade are breathtaking and the interior very impressive. You can take a tour to the crypts below as well as the rooftops for spectacular views of the city.",
          "You have to see this Cathedral if you\u2019re in Palermo, no questions asked. Yes, it\u2019s beautiful, but when you go up to the roof (100 steps) it\u2019s a spectacular view of the city. The 7 euros cost per person includes the tresurary and the crypt . This is one of the reasons you came to",

          "After spending 5 days in Rome, we were surprised to find such stunning churches in Palermo. Such ignorance on our part. This is a world heritage site, for very good reason. Wonderful architecture; a blend of several styles and cultures. You must see!",
          "I find it difficult to 'rate' and review any church or cathedral, because they're really not there for anything other than their raison d'\u00eatre - to be a place of worship. In that respect, this cathedral fulfils its role perfectly. The external appearance has a strong influence",
          "This is an interesting building with a rich history. It is worth a visit for its grandeur. If you have a guide book it is easy to put the things in front of you into the proper perspective. That always helps when in a church that has been added to so much through the years.",
          "This is a very imposing building with a rich history. The many architectural styles are a chronology of the many cultures that ruled Sicily.",
          "Perfect, must see while you are in Palermo. Also treasure room and combs, we didn't go to roof because it was close due to rain.",
          "For me, the interior didn't match the exterior - but I have to point out that I'm not into roofs or crypts so I only saw a portion of the whole. However, compared with the truly astonishingly beautiful architecture it was a bit of a disappointment. There were some very bling",
          "Really enjoyed our guided tour. Something not to be missed. Beautiful building. Look out for the sundial illuminating the signs of the zodiac",

          "Due to a long history of additions this beautiful Cathedral has a complex architecture; its huge and fascinating at first glance, from a distance. It made me feel tiny and insignificant when I stepped inside; its height and dimension was really exciting for my eyes and mind!",

          "It was \u20ac7 (no concession) to see the cathedral, tombs, rooftop, treasury and crypt. The Catholic Church must certainly be making a lot of money in Sicily, because there were precious few churches we could visit for free! There was a service in progress, being Sunday, so there",

          "Spectacular building. The visit of the roof is worth the money (the other exhibitions are not).",
          "Every church has an aura. You can just sit inside and think about thousands of people who went there, about their wishes and troubles. An amazing architecture and sculptures emphasize these emotions. \nFor taking pictures from outside i think is better in first half of the day because of sun position.",
          "Quite a lovely cathedral, although it doesn't have the mosaics like some of the other churches, like the one in Monreale for instance. You can enter for free, but to see the treasury, crypts and to ascend to the roof, you'll have to pay. I \u2026",
          "Interesting sight to visit with lots of history. Definitely take a guided tour or get an app that guides you through the cathedral so that you get the most out of it. \nThe roof top is also awesome with a 360 degree view over Palermo",
          "Very beautiful church from both inside and outside. There is a big square in front of it. I went there in a sunny day. It is a perfect place to spend one afternoon to take the sunshine and enjoy relaxing life.",
          "Great place to visit. Roof is accessible every 30 minutes and try to be there 10 minutes before every half and o'clock. Stairs are one way and if whoever elderly is in front of you it is gonna take a long time to get up. Also upstairs is little small so I recommend rushing it to the top.",
          "Simply beautiful. View form rooftop was amazing. Climbing trough narrow stairs was challenging, but when you reach top... entrance fee is normal, waiting list is short.",
          "Useful information, there's toilet in the church for those wayward travelers that charges 50 cents. Just let your conscious drop the money placed at the door, I'm shocked that many people didn't. But again, they didn't replace toilet paper, \u2026",
          "Such a nice place. Great wheather atmosphere nature beautiful place attractive structure everything is great and best\nI like this place",
          "A must-see sight in the heart of Palermo!\nWell maintained and preserved.\nEntering inside is free but there is a fee if you want to go to the rooftop; treasuries; underground area or the tombs. 10\u20ac is the adult fee you pay to see everything. Awesome experience guaranteed.",
          "This was pretty much the most memorable visit in Palermo. And it's mainly  due to the 5 euros I paid to go up to the roof of the cathedral. Absolutely stunning views of the city and the mountains. Really an unforgettable moment. The inside \u2026",
          "Amazing!!! Grandeur!! Architecture mixed with religion and history. The sculptures are amazing and just viewing them provides a lesson in history.\n\nI am amazed to visit places that have survived wars, natural disasters and human disrespect \u2026",

          "So huge outside...so empty inside. Roof walk was not open (only Sundays).",
          "The place is really really beautiful, it worths a visit! The church itself is really big and nice inside. You have the chance to go to the roof for 5\u20ac and you can have a beautiful visit to the city and for the hill/ sea.",
          "This cathedral will enchant you with is typically Mediterranean charm, covered in warm, earthy colours on the outside. Such a pity that on the inside the architecture is nothing spectacular; yet, it deserves a look inside because of its crypts and the possibility to have a walk atop the domes.",
          "Very nice and beautiful spot. Definitely worth a visit. We visited this site more than once. Beautiful beautiful place, the kids can run around, awesome atmosphere and a great place to grab a drink, chill and enjoy life. This spot really shows the historical and impressive Italian art. Would recommend that you go check out this spot!",

          "Quite spectacular inside the mixture of religious cultures. The Christian and Islamic mosaics were astonishing.  Make sure you're suitably dressed keep  shoulders and down to the knees covered.",
          "Quite busy. They stick to a strict dress code.  Cover your shoulders and knees. They do provide poncho's of shame for covering up. Entry is free. Toilets are behind a side chapel alter.  Worth a visit. Upper roof tours available if you have a head for heights.",
          "Beautiful church.  Be sure to make your way to the back and look down to the main alter rather then just as you enter from the side.  The main aisle from door to altar is breathtaking.  Make sure to see this wonder when in Sicily.  I dont \u2026",
          "The most amazing cathedral I've seen so far! The outside is a mix of different cultures - Italian, Latino, Arabic and Western Europe as well! The inside is also amazing, though I found the outside much more beautiful with all those \u2026",
          "It might be the best case to talk about architectural style. The mixed if Gothic, Baroque and even Islamic. No one can drive the style of Sicily because the Sicilian are free birds!",
          "Beautiful cathedral, with a lot of pretty greens around. Very clean and the entry to the Cathedral is completely free! Great way to explore the history of Palermo and the different styles of architecture. Definitely worth a visit! You can easily walk there from the cruise port!",

          "Really impressive both externally and internally. The surrounding area is also very, very beautiful. This is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I have ever seen. Fully recommended to visit. After this you may walk through Vittorio \u2026",
          "Beautiful cathedral.  You do not need to pay to see the cathedral, but there are several paid exhibits within.  We paid for all but the roof as the weather was questionable.  The royal tomb/crypts were underwhelming, but the main crypts and the other areas were fantastic especially considering the price.",
          "Must see place in Palermo. Don't miss the roof and the spectacular panorama over the city. Take a seat at the beautiful garden and enjoy the moment. From here you can take a walk towards the harbor.",
          "It has beautiful history, and such a state of art cathedral. But was a little dissappointed by the people who issue tickets to go in, since we were suppose to pay a price which by the way it was written on a poster outside and ended up \u2026",

          "Outstanding! Just perfect. I didn't have the chance to get in. But I loved the looks of it.",
          "I only gave 4 stars because they're ripping people off (5e just to get a nice view from the balcony) and 10e for the entire cathedral. Also if you're wearing summer clothes (in summer this is inevitable) you need to pay 1e to cover yourself. That just sucks. The cathedral is a must-see",
          "Arab-Norman architectural masterpiece! Well deserved UNESCO status. Don't miss!",
          "Top quality Cathedral packed with interest.",
          "Even though it is impressive for its volume its decoration is rather poor. Go to the cathedral of Monreale to be really impressed.",

          "This is a must see place. You can access the roof for some stunning views over the city, spiral staircase to get to the roof beware!\nOne way up, one way down but well worth it if you can.\nIf the roof is too much you can see the inside at no charge but you need to pay to see the crypt and jewels which I found interesting.",
          "It's a typical Italian cathedral. The inside looks fantastic. The entrance is for free and if you pay 5,00\u20ac (08.2019) you can even get on the roof of the cathedral and have a view over the buildings around.",

          "Well conserved, free access.",
          "For \u20ac8 you can see the king's tombs, the treasury and crypt and go on the roof. It's well worth doing this. Access to the roof is up a narrow spiral staircase. They let a new group up every 30 minutes and you have about 20 minutes on the roof. Great views over Palermo. It's well worth paying the \u20ac8 to see everything.",
          "Was captivated by the beauty of this building from the outside, quite an imposing structure.",

          "Amazing place. You need to see it",
          "It is not only great but also huge. A remark perhaps of the economical availability of that time, which usually represents a confirmed reign, wider than a local vicinity.",
          "Very beautiful place\nAmazing view for Palermo for 5 \u20ac",

          "Cathedral outside and inside is beautiful,  not the best I have seen,  but it's OK. \nMost disappointment about roof visiting  - it cost 5 Euro,  but actually it is very short area allowed to walk. Entrance and exit is organized the same way \u2026",

Previously the land of the garden had belonged to the nuns of San Domenico al Maglio and was obtained, after a lot of pressure, in 1551. Subsequently, in 1584, the Palazzo di San Clemente was built on this site. The creation of this unusual garden (devoid of palaces) and of the fountain was commissioned to the Florentine sculptor Francesco Camilliani, student of Baccio Bandinelli.The work was started in 1554. The fountain included 48 statues and was surrounded by a long arbor formed by 90 columns of wood designed by Bartolomeo Ammannati. Giorgio Vasari called the fountain: \u00abfonte stupendissima che non ha pari in Fiorenza n\u00e8 forse in Italia\u00bb (\u00abwonderful-est fountain, that is unparalleled in Florence and maybe in all Italy\u00bb).\n\n\n=== Relocation to Palermo ===\n\nIn 1573 the indebted Luigi de Toledo (brother of the former Viceroy of Sicily Garc\u00eda de Toledo), on the verge of moving to Naples, sold the fountain to the city of Palermo. In fact, the Senate of Palermo decided to buy the building e to place it in the square in front of the Palazzo Pretorio.\nOn 26 May 1574 the fountain arrived in Palermo. In order to transport it, the fountain was disassembled in 644 pieces. Then, in order to make room for the fountain, several buildings were demolished. However, the fountain arrived incompleted in Palermo. Some sculptures were damaged during the transport, others were maybe kept by Luigi de Toledo (probably the statues of two Divinities preserved in the Bargello Museum of Florence and other statues placed in Naples and then in the garden of Abadia, in the Spanish city of C\u00e1ceres).\nTherefore, in Palermo some adjustment were necessary. The work of assembling was made by Camillo Camilliani, son of Francesco Camilliani. In 1581 he completed the work with the help of Michelangelo Naccherino.\nBetween 18th century and 19th century, the fountain was considered a sort of depiction of the corrupt municipality of Palermo.  For this reason and because of the nudity of the statues, the square became known as \"Piazza della Vergogna\" (Square of Shame).\nIn 1998 the restoration of the fountain started. It was completed in 2003.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe fountain represents the Twelve Olympians, other mythological figures, animals and the rivers of Palermo. \n\n\n== Curiosity ==\nIn 1973, Italian National Postal Service dedicated a postage stamp to the Fontana Pretoria.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPiazza Pretoria\nPalazzo Pretorio\nSanta Caterina\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Image gallery\n(in Italian) Profile of the fountain - arte.it\n(in Italian) History of the fountain - Provincia Regionale di Palermo",

          "The fenced gate was open on our visit so we were able to get right to the centre. Beautiful statues adorn the fountain. Love the story that the Mass goers were so appalled by the nudity of the statues that they named it the fountain of shame.",
          "This amazing fountain, surrounded from 3 sides by important buildings, is quite impressive, all white marble, with so many different statues beautifully blended together. Some parts do not work, would need bit better taking care for it",
          "This is a beautiful piazza. A great place to take pictures during the day or at night. Take a break here and enjoy lunch looking at many naked human figures. It's also a very central place: you can go to the church around the corner and to the Quattro Canti. Also, you can hop on",
          "Fontana Pretoria is absolutely stunning, pity there is nowhere for an aerial view, to get a true appreciation of the brilliant layout. The fountain was not intended for a public space but rather for a private villa in Florence. Built by Francesco Camilliani in 1554, it was",
          "great craftsmanship and design, a fountain that dominates it surroundings. Looks fantastic day or night and worth taking a moment to study",
          "Beautiful, beautiful beautiful. It is very difficult to describe in details Fontana Pretoria. If you think that the Trevi Fountain is beautiful, come down to Palermo and absorb the beauty of Fontana Pretoria. Highly recommended.",
          "The fountain is very beautiful art work. It was the third stop on our itinerary of Palermo tour. The whole town is full of Baroque and Neoclasicism art pieces and the fountain is no exception.",
          "You must take a good wake around each level of the Fountain. You can almost see the sculptor's devious grin as he is creating these interesting characters. I would recommend you read about it before you go to see it. Understanding the history makes it all the more interesting.",
          "Very beautiful, but the local story is most interesting. The fountain was placed in the piazza between a church and a convent. The priest and nuns were not happy with what they saw everyday with the nude statues. They say one night the nuns removed parts that where offensive.",
          "Very pretty fountain, but unlike Trevi in Rome, you look UP at this fountain and it appears to be surrounded by a steel fence at the front (go around to the side and you can enter and walk up to the top level. It's a pleasant space, just off the four corners area.",
          "This large fountain is located in the heart of Palermo between two of its prime sights (the Quattro Canti and La Martorana church), so you can't help but see it with its numerous sculptures when touring this area near the city center. It's surrounded by an attractive palazzo and",
          "This was within 100 meters of our B&B and if you find yourself on Via Vittoria Emanuele near Via Roma take a quick detour to visit. It is a place where many come for pictures (a wedding shoot was ongoing when we were there).",
          "Definitely worth a visit. No many other tourists were in the square when we were there. Very quiet considering its location.",
          "The fountain is really big, maybe a bit too big for the square where it's located on. For a photo you should go up the stairs of a building nearby. You wouldn't expect such a big fountain on a square as peaceful as this one.",
          "very interest fountain in front of the city hall. The larger than life statutes leave little to the imagination.",
          "This is an enormous fountain originally intended to be built in Firenze but was brought to Palermo in pieces a reconstructed, on a slightly smaller scale in the Piazza. It is called the Fountain of Shame locally due to the high number of nude statues it contains and is bounded",
          "This is a great fountain. So much to see! Apparently it shocked the locals when it was built and it is easy to see why.",
          "Much nude sculpture impresses and delights with its sensuous and exotic representation of the human form. However, for me, these figures do little more than enhance nudity like a restricted beach on the Cote d'azur. It is not all the fault of the sculptor. Since the fountain was",
          "It is a really lovely fountain surrounded by interesting architecture as well. It's worth the walk. It is a pity that you cannot sit down on the fountains borders, but it's understandable.",
          "Palermo is rather lacking in expansive urban piazzas; the Fontana della Vergogna anchors one of them, the Piazza Pretoria. One can walk around the fenced-in fountain and admire the facades of surrounding buildings, but no place really to sit.",
          "Beautiful fountain and piazza. Really close to Quattro Cantti. I recommend a visit here if you go to Palermo.",
          "If you are in the area , this is worth seeing if only for its size. The various themes depicted by the statues are interesting to view if you have some time to spare .",
          "It is a very nice spot with cafe around and little market if you enter one of the little streets. The fountain looks very pretty and it is not far from all the other things that are worth to look at and take a picture when you visit Palermo. Entire city is beautiful, but such",
          "No matter where you go in Palermo, you will probably pass by this fountain and it is quite something as it takes over almost the entire square. Aren't the Palermitani lucky to have been able to acquire it?",
          "You would never stop analysing the statues and decorations, once by one, of this Fountain which takes almost the whole square but the overall view is also beautiful and eye-catching",
          "This monument was my first Impression of Palermitan art after my walk from the Central Station. It made me stop in amazement and did not leave before taking pictures of all the sculptural elements of this magnificent monument. I was visiting Palermo for a day tour because I was",
          "A hidden gem we stumbled across on a quiet sleepy Sunday afternoon. There was almost no one around and we had the place to ourselves. The craftsmanship is beautiful and the setting superb. Make sure you include this on your list.",
          "What a gorgeous fountain -- Fontana Della Vergogna, or Fountain of Shame! Years ago, it was open to the public, allowing one to walk up the steps and enjoy the fountain from within. On our recent visit, the gates were locked but we were able to admire the statues from a close",

          "This is one of the most gorgeous places one can find in this magic city. I had the bless of seeing it snow (very rare in Palermo) in the morning in this place. Wow, I will not forget the show of seeing the snow flakes fall while seeing this marvelous sculpture set. Beautiful",
          "Yes this is the name the 16th century Sicilians gave this fountain. It's full of nudes though of course has been damaged over the years, plenty to spot at all levels including the beasts heads towards the centre. Nice place for a bit of a breather after walking round Palermo",
          "When this fountain was unveiled the nakedness was shameful. The genitalas were not touch and so the noses were cut off??? Go figure.",
          "Literally around the corner from the Quattro Canti. A large tiered fountain with many statues of naked men and women, from which the statue\u2019s second came is derived \u2013 La Fontana della Vergogna (Fountain of Shame). Only a 10-15 minute visit is required.",
          "For me this is Italy's most beautiful fountain: Monumental, impressive, beautiful and unique. Usually closed to public (it is fenced) in Feb 2016 in the early afternoon we found the gates open for visit - not sure if regular though. But even without open gates it is an",
          "Great story of how the fountain got there.Surrounding buildings are worth a closer look and the Four Corners are nearby.",
          "We visited this attraction and despite the comments about the fencing the fountain is still accessible and visible, you just have to walk around more to take it all in. Fabulous animal heads spouting into the pools.",
          "This fountain was beautiful, but I feel the fencing hid a lot of the fountain. I know they're trying to keep people off the fountain, but I wish they would find another way. Standing behind a fence, trying to see the whole fountain, spoiled it for me a little, but it is still",
          "Impressive fountain next to the Four Corners Square. Interesting details on different levels. When I visited it was open so I could walk around freely.",
          "It is amazing how it is still standing after all these years. It show a lot of ware and tear, but still worth seeing. Mostly fenced in.",
          "This ornate fountain, with its tiered basins and sculptures built in concentric circles, is at the centre of Piazza Pretoria .The nude nymphs proved too much for church-goers attending Mass next door, and it was dubbed the Fountain of Shame! It's just beautiful anyway.",
          "The splendour and grandeur of this fountain is difficult to describe until you experience it, whether by day or, particularly, by night! Another unmissable Palermo sight!",
          "Great art work. Interesting history. Good place to take rest. I was especially interested in imitation of different animal faces.",

          "A lovely place to stop and wander around the fountain. The white marble is reflective on a hot day, so can feel very hot, but if you can find some shade, its lovely to sit & relax. The fountain itself is an odd mix of animals spouting water- a hippo, camel, dog, lion, wolf",
          "We stumbled across this on a lovely evening and the light was fantastic. The statues are a bizarre mixture of the very life like with distorted figures and odd interpretations of animals (real and fantastic)",
          "This is one of those places that you hear about but unless you actually go there you cannot appreciate it. The Fontana della Vergogna is an artistic delight and an architectural marvel. You have probably seen it in books and pictures, but you must see it in person.",
          "Lots of history and interesting. The fountain is located in the middle of a square that must have been magnificent in it's day. sadly the surronding buildings need repair. Be sure to visit the church off to the side.",
          "Located in the Piazza Pretoria, which is the Center of Palermo, is this fun, but rather nice piece of work. It was originally bought in the 15th century, and was modified to fit the square. The square is nicknamed the Square of Shame because of the nude statues. It is a very",

        "wiki": "The Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas (Italian: Museo Archeologico Regionale Antonio Salinas) is a museum in Palermo, Italy. It possesses one of the richest collections of Punic and Ancient Greek art in Italy, as well as many items related to the history of Sicily. Formerly the property of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, the museum is dedicated to Antonio Salinas, a famous archaeologist and numismatist from Palermo. It is part of the Olivella monumental complex, which includes the Church of St. Ignatius and the adjoining Oratory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the Olivella complex was begun in the late sixteenth century by the architect Antonio Muttone for the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri and completed in the seventeenth century. Following the law on the suppression of religious orders of 1866 the building was confiscated and became home to the museum.During the Second World War the director of the museum, Jole Bovio Marconi, moved all the material held in the museum to the monastery of San Martino delle Scale. This saved the collection from destruction by the bombing during the Allied invasion of Sicily. In 1949 Bovio Marconi was made responsible for the redevelopment of the museum, as the building was heavily damaged the building was renovated by architect William De Angelis D'Ossat. From 18 July 2011 the museum has been closed for renovation. As of September 2015, only a small part of the museum is accessible free of charge. It is uncertain when the full exhibition will be reopened.\n\n\n== Sections ==\n\nOn the ground floor, a section is dedicated to the artefacts found underwater, including materials that were part of the cargo of vessels, stone anchors, strains of lead, lamps, amphoras and inscriptions ranging from the culture of the Phoenicians to that of the Romans.\nThe Phoenician section displays two large anthropomorphic sarcophagi of the fifth century BC from the necropolis of Pizzo Cannita (near modern Misilmeri). There are also sculptures of gods and Phoenician votive stelae from Mozia and Lilybaeum.\nA reconstruction of the east pediment of the archaeological site of Selinunte is exhibited, displaying the Gorgon of Temple C, several metopes with mythological reliefs (Temples C and E) and sculptures of the archaic and classical period. In 1823, two British architects, Samuel Angell and William Harris, ventured to excavate at Selinunte in the course of their tour of Sicily, and came upon many fragments of sculptured metopes from the Archaic temple now known as \u201cTemple C.\u201d Although local officials tried to stop them, they continued their work, and attempted to export their finds to England, destined for the British Museum. Now in the shadow of the activities of Lord Elgin, Angell and Harris\u2019s shipments were diverted to Palermo, where they remain to this day in the Archaeological Museum.\nArtifacts from Himera are on display, as well as objects and sculptures from Solunto, Megara Hyblaea, Tindari, Kamarina and Agrigento. Among the most important works of art are the great Ram bronze of the third century BC from Syracuse, a Roman copy of a sculpture by Lysippus depicting Heracles catching the Ceryneian Hind and a Roman copy of a marble statue by Praxiteles depicting a satyr.\nThe Roman period is documented by a collection of sculptures and mosaics found in villas from Piazza Vittoria in Palermo, where the center of the Roman city was previously located. Even prehistoric cultures present in the caves around the territory of Palermo are exhibited in the museum.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe museum is composed in part by private collections purchased or donated to the museum over the centuries.\n\n\n=== University Museum collection ===\nIt is the oldest collection of the museum which was acquired in 1814 when Giuseppe Emanuele Ventimiglia, Prince of Belmonte left his collection to the University of Palermo at his death. The university in turn sold it to the museum.\n\n\n=== Antonio Salinas collection ===\nThis collection is the largest in size with 6.641 pieces and gave its name to the museum. It was sold to the museum by Antonio Salinas at his death in 1914 by means of a will. The collection consists of books, manuscripts, prints, photographs, personal items and about 6000 coins.\n\n\n=== Pietro Bonci Casuccini collection ===\nThis is the Etruscan collection which consists of sarcophagi, gravestones, urns and Attic black and red-figure pottery. It is considered the most important Etruscan collection outside of Tuscany. The exhibits come from Chiusi as part of the excavations carried out in the estates of Count Pietro Bonci Casuccini.\nThe collection was put up for sale by the grandsons of the founder, Ottavio and Pietro. The sale of the collection was prevented by the Kingdom of Italy in 1863, by the intervention of Michele Amari who was Minister of Education at the time. The state acquired the collection and transferred it to the Regional Archeological Museum of Palermo.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalermo Fragment\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nListing in the directory of museums of the Region of Sicily",

          "The Museum was hidden behind road construction, took a little looking, but it was worth it, especially with free admission. The building itself is gorgeous. Most of the artifacts are from Selinunte, an active dig site a little west of Agrigento. Interesting collection of stone",

        "wiki": "The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo (also Catacombe dei Cappuccini or Catacombs of the Capuchins) are burial catacombs in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. Today they provide a somewhat macabre tourist attraction as well as an extraordinary historical record.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\nPalermo's Capuchin monastery outgrew its original cemetery in the 16th century and monks began to excavate crypts below it. In 1599 they mummified one of their number, recently dead brother Silvestro of Gubbio, and placed him into the catacombs.\nThe bodies were dehydrated on the racks of ceramic pipes in the catacombs and sometimes later washed with vinegar. Some of the bodies were embalmed and others enclosed in sealed glass cabinets. Monks were preserved with their everyday clothing and sometimes with ropes they had worn as a penance.\nOriginally the catacombs were intended only for the dead friars. However, in the following centuries it became a status symbol to be entombed into the Capuchin catacombs. In their wills, local luminaries would ask to be preserved in certain clothes, or even to have their clothes changed at regular intervals. Priests wore their clerical vestments, others were clothed according to the contemporary fashion. Relatives would visit to pray for the deceased and also to maintain the body in presentable condition.\nThe catacombs were maintained through the donations of the relatives of the deceased. Each new body was placed in a temporary niche and later placed into a more permanent place. As long as the contributions continued, the body remained in its proper place but when the relatives did not send money any more, the body was put aside on a shelf until they resumed payments.\n\n\n== Interments ==\n\nThe last friar interred into the catacombs was Brother Riccardo in 1871 but other famous people were still interred. The catacombs were officially closed in 1880 but tourists continued to visit. The last burials are from the 1920s. One of the very last to be interred was Rosalia Lombardo, then nearly two years old, whose body is still remarkably intact, preserved with a procedure.  The embalming procedure, performed by Professor Alfredo Salafia, consisted of formalin to kill bacteria, alcohol to dry the body, glycerin to keep her from overdrying, salicylic acid to kill fungi, and the most important ingredient, zinc salts (zinc sulfate and zinc chloride) to give the body rigidity. The formula is 1 part glycerin, 1 part formalin saturated with both zinc sulfate and chloride, and 1 part of an alcohol solution saturated with salicylic acid.\nThe catacombs contain about 8000 corpses and 1252 mummies (as stated by last census made by EURAC in 2011) that line the walls. The halls are divided into categories: Men, Women, Virgins, Children, Priests, Monks, and Professionals. Some bodies are better preserved than others. Some are set in poses; for example, two children are sitting together in a rocking chair. The coffins were accessible to the families of the deceased so that on certain days the family could hold their hands and they could \"join\" their family in prayer.\nFamous people buried in the catacombs include:\n\nColonel Enea DiGuiliano (in French Bourbon uniform)\nSalvatore Manzella, surgeon\nLorenzo Marabitti, sculptor\nFilipo Pennino, sculptor\nSon of a king of Tunis who had converted to Catholicism\nGiuseppe Velasco also called Vel\u00e1squez the Sicilian painter of Chinese Palace in Palermo.\nGiuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa is sometimes said to be buried in the catacombs, but he is buried in the cemetery next to them.\n\n\n== Scientific research ==\nThe Sicily Mummy Project was created in 2007, to study the mummies and to create profiles on those that were mummified. The project is led by the  anthropologist Dario Piombino-Mascali of the Department of Cultural Heritage and Sicilian Identity in Palermo, and is backed by the European Academy of Bozen/Bolzano The mummies are X-Rayed and given CT scans in order to preserve the mummies, along with other anthropolicial and paleopathological techniques to confirm the age, and sex of the individuals. Piombino-Mascali credits the program with re-opening the discussion about death in Sicily;  \n\nFor many years the subject of death was taboo [in Sicily]. Now, given the scientific importance of what's emerging with these mummies, people are understanding that in Sicily, death has always been part of life. And for centuries many Sicilians were using mummification to make sure there was a constant relationship between life and death.\nForensic biologist Mark Benecke identified several insects that shed a light on the process of mummification.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe catacombs are open to the public and taking photographs inside is supposedly prohibited, with prominent signs making it clear to visitors that photography is not allowed.  However, the bodies have been shown on film in Francesco Rosi's Cadaveri Eccellenti (\"Illustrious Corpses\"), and television programmes such as the Channel 4 series Coach Trip, BBC TV series Francesco's Italy: Top to Toe, Ghosthunting With Paul O'Grady and Friends on ITV2 in 2008 and The Learning Channel in 2000. Iron grills have been installed to prevent tourists tampering or posing with the corpses.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapuchin Crypt, in Rome Italy\nCapela dos Ossos, in \u00c9vora, Portugal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "Unfortunately, you're not allowed to take pictures which is a bit of a let-down. It's quite eerie and first impressions are a bit confronting. The macabre spectacle afforded by the sight of the dead, all lined up in their suits and dresses, can be quite unnerving. The stories",
          "Words are at a loss when one tries to describe a tourist attraction that consists of the exhibition of dead people. To see the bodies in varying decrees of decay, in open coffins or hanging on display on the walls...well, it makes you think about death, and wonder who these",
          "Wow.... What a place to visit... For a start only 3 euro entrance... They could charge so much more because of the dear bambino Rosalia Lombardo. Peaceful to walk around and fascinating embalming methods..... People complain about it being morbid.... It is a catacombe. It says",
          "Really shocking and unique place with very kind fratelli. Really not allowed underage people. It is very very exceptional. Never seen such before.",
          "This is a must thing to do in Palermo! The ticket is 3\u20ac. The place is stunning. The only disadvantage I think is that there are no descriptions so you have to \u201cstudy \u201c before you go there!",
          "Probably another 20 + mins by foot. If you have difficulty walking,get a cab. The trip is worthwhile! Have never seen anything like it,ever! The mummies are all lined up and fully dressed......from Clerics,to Men and women and...children,even babies! All there in their best",
          "The whole reason I went to Palermo in the first place and it didn't disappoint think it was 5euro entrance it was a lot more than I expected and really different thing to do I've been to quite a few ossuarys and this was up there at the top you aren't allowed to take pictures",
          "Really awesome, and educational experience. I thought it was going to be scary, nevertheless it was an amazing experience.",
          "I would never take a child there. And I think it should not be a place classified as a tourist attraction. I felt very bad looking at those copses and skeletons. I would not like anyone from my family being exposed like that. I left before 3 minutes feeling desgastes and heavy",
          "A bizarre experience ! The catacombe houses around 8000 skeletons in their burial nooks/coffins, most dressed in the finery of the day. There are sections for men, women, priests, children and virgins \u2026. They date back to the 1700\u2019s - an incredible display. Entry costs 4 Euro -",
          "Very interesting to see how they preserved there dead, made you feel very close, not creepy and very well worth the visit, I can imagine how I could now look if preserved and put to rest in a similar place rather than being cremated",
          "A place that's macabre and creepy that's definitely not for everyone. If you think you can handle it is worth a visit, as it is an experience you definitely won't have experienced before. The ticket costs 3\u20ac.",
          "Not an ossuary but rather a disturbing display of mortal remains. Mummified remains are hung on the walls clothed in disintegrating tatters. It was really very bizarre and disturbing.",
          "Definitely not a universal tourist attraction. Only a small part of our group liked it, most of us did not, including me. If someone likes seeing macabre dead mummified bodies of children - 5 stars. If not, I definitely do not recommend. Taking photos is prohibited there, also",
          "It was interesting to see the corpses in standing position - not what I expected. Mostly skeletons, but some faces preserved, and various clothes fading - it was all fascinating. The entry fee is small, so it\u2019s worth the 15-20-minute visit.",
          "Fascinating - thrililng - a bit frigthening. See mummies of normal people, families (uncl, childen and babies), professionals, all in their original clothing, who were buried in the catacombs over the last centuries. Somy lying, some upright, some still with skin, some pure",
          "Fascinating but a bit macabre. Yes, there are dead bodies and yes, it's part of the history of the city but in hindsight I shouldn't have visited it. It felt a bit disrespectful being there as a tourist.",
          "This is not perhaps for anyone who is squeamish about seeing endless rows of the mummified dead, but it is an utterly fascinating, larger version of the same Order's crypt in Rome. Divided into sections and well laid out in terms of access and lighting, the remains vary from",
          "You would have thought it would be a very interesting place, though, in a very depressed and miserable part of the city, the Catacombe is a very weird store of fully day dressed dead people. Some really quite recent - circa 100 years. You couldn't really call it a display - just",
          "The Capuchin Catacombs is a creepy, gruesome burial site for thousands of mummified bodies and corpses. You descend into the enormous maze of underground catacombs of the monastery, to walk among the dead. Corpses (including babies) hang from the walls, are stacked on shelves,",
          "very interesting cemetry and museum where almost 1000 or more skeletons of dead people of the past are either stuck on the wall or displayed in special cases.You feel like you are on a horror movie.",
          "The catacombs are essentially a private cemetery which include bodies of monks and people who could afford to be buried here. The unusual thing is that the corpses are strung up and hung vertically along miles of corridors. It is a scene the likes of which you will never see",
          "People wanted to visit their beloved deceased family members after they had died, so many children and babies, too. Many hundreds of skeletons are all dressed up in their best clothes, all returning to dust. This is death and it is real.",
          "Dead people all around you. Very interesting but can get very scary for some. Still, one of the must see in Palermo.",
          "Not at all what I was expecting. Didn\u2019t realise there was a tradition of mummification in Europe. Brings out lots of words; sad, scary, comical and tragic are just a few. A place that has to be seen to be belived. The cemetery above it is also worth a stroll around.",
          "I found it fascinating. Bodies stuffed with straw, hanging on wires and dressed in their best clothes of the era. My friend thought they were wax dummies but no ..... Priests, business men, ladies of fashion 1800s and children of all ages. Apparently 6000 in total but a lot",
          "Can't say this was an enjoyable place. It's exactly what you expect, preserved bodies out in the open to be looked at. There is a minor amount of history about but it is not a museum. The point is to remind us to live a fruitful life.",
          "This may not be for the faint hearted since it is all dead bodies, but it is amazing to see! Some bodies are in a more mummified state than others. There are sections for monks, professional people and babies. Look at the different outfits that are on display? For obvious",
          "Underground crypt stacked with hundreds of corpses. Most of them are no more than skeletons but a certain amount of mummified flesh and hair still adheres to some. For the most part they're displayed upright, in their original clothes. There are monks, professional men, women",
          "Not sure how anyone can give this 5 stars. It's one of those 'attractions' that you go for the experience because you can. But there were no volunteers to go round a second time. It certainly presents death in all its finality. By the end I was happy for if to be over, and we",
          "Such a cool and different thing to do. A bit of a walk to get to, though. We met a man on a train who said that he fled this place after a few minutes due to the energy. Lol. My spouse, who absolutely hates anything scary, decided to come with me, and was perfectly fine. He",
          "As you wander the crypt hallways you can't help but wonder about past activity when families would spend time here visiting loved ones. I am glad this was one of my first stops, it helped me understand the significance of crypts at smaller churches in Italy. Take time to stroll",
          "We had been to the Capuchin catacombs in Rome which are definitely unusual and this place was equally so and even more ghoulish. I wanted to know more about the bodies that were displayed. Their clothes gave some clue, but not much. Most were anonymous. Strange place and not",
          "There are no toilets or cappuccinos available. Its lovely and cool down down down in there, buying the guide (E4) is an idea if you want to have any info. I just enjoyed looking at all the dead people. The kids will love this and just watch their shiny, arrogant, entitled",
          "We were in Palermo five days so made time to see this,if you are here only a few days I would skip this. It\u2019s a long walk from the centre but cheap to go in. So many more interesting places to visit. It\u2019s pretty Morbid and perhaps not nice for young children. My partner said",
          "Only \u20ac3 but when you\u2019ve seen one skull wrapped in material you\u2019ve seen them all. Slightly disturbing, and nothing to help guide you to different areas in English, so I didn\u2019t know what I was looking at. Skipped the queues and left pretty quickly....",
          "For people into weird, this is worth the six Euros. It\u2019s an easy 30 minute walk out the North Portal from the historic district. They ask that you not take photos but there are postcards for sale of the more interesting mummies.",
          "This is the most weird thing I have ever visited, skeltons everywhere fully clothed from children to adults. I'm not entirely sure how to describe the feeling you get whilst you are there, it goes from \"why am I looking at skeletons\" to creepy to finding the costumes and",
          "Macabre and fascinating well worth a visit and like nowhere else I have been a must see in Palermo and something you won\u2019t forget",
          "Firstly, I\u2019d advise walking there. You could probably use public transport, but by the time you\u2019ve waited for it, you could have got there on foot. From the Quattro Canti, it will probably take 25 mins to walk it. The place itself is fascinating, but leave your selfie stick at",
          "Underground tunnels filled with rows of skeletons of various ages. All the skeletons are dressed and at various stages of decay. Ten minutes here is more than enough time. Do not bring children.",
          "It's pretty obvious you will see a lot of dead people here, but to be clear, you will see A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE. EVERYWHERE. It's fascinating, especially the clothes that the corpses are wearing, but I would not recommend this to anyone of a nervous disposition. The section with",
          "Decided to walk from our BB near the Marina not one off our best decisions.when we eventually found the catacombs we were surprised by its location and the surrounding area, run down best describes it. We found it interesting and macabre in a strange way. Some of the body's were",
          "Parking available outside. White lines mean there is no fee for parking but some toothless guy insisted we pay him 2 Euro for the parking. Didn\u2019t give us a ticket or anything, just took the money. It is both interesting and creepy to see how they have preserved the bodies.",
          "On a recommendation, we walked to the Catacombs. WARNING....This is NOT a place to bring kids. We were not expecting what we experienced. Bodies lining the walls that are in various states of decay. Most were bones but others still had leathery skin on their skulls/faces.",
          "It was about a 20 minute walk from the Norman Palace. It was a pretty direct route but there were very few signs posted to let you know you were on the right path, but I've found that to be pretty typical in Italy. Luckily there were plenty of friendly people willing to direct",
          "...unless you really like seeing dead bodies and skeletons. Three euro entry is fair considering the presentation of the people on display, although it is sad that these people are used as a tourist attraction. Only went as it was part of a tour we were on. It would benefit",
          "Went with my wife, 2 teenage sons, and parents in law. First 10 minutes were interesting, rest was just creepy. I left early with my younger son and mother in law who were both done after 5 minutes. OK to skip",
          "Didn\u2019t know what to expect but was very impressed with the whole experience. The cadavers are in seperate sections according to their status, profession, sex and age. You enter and descend into the Catacombs which are well presented if not a bit macabre.",
          "We visited the monastery and catacombs of capuchins and there are lots of dead people there. It\u2019s quite interesting if not creepy to see. Remember that in those days, people thought it was fashionable to be mummified and preserved for eternity in the clothing they chose. Some",
          "We visited this place today. It\u2019s a little out of the main town however we walked there. (Nothing else around to see nearby.) Only about 20 stairs down to the \u201c catacombs.\u201d Not as cool as I hoped. The skeletons are mostly vertical and dressed. I didn\u2019t like seeing their heads.",
          "Not for the faint of heart I suppose, but the sheer amount of bodies is amazing. The Capuchin monks realized they could profit from the crypt by selling slots, and thousands of people are interred here. The floors are glass, and so you feel like you may slide through - but it is",
          "We went there with 2 teenagers. We all found the place very unique and interesting. We did not have a guide but I will definitely recommend to read a little about it before visiting. We spent around 1 hour at the place and it is easy to park just outside. All photos and films",
          "This is a very eerie experience...it made us aware just how disensitized we as humans have become. Seeing the corpses you almost don't want to believe they are real. Some of the more preserved skeletons are very \"real\" looking and scary. The monk and the gentleman at front desk",
          "Honestly I couldn\u2019t believe how well preserved this was. There were many bodies and what I found interesting was the way that they were displayed. Very respectable place. Interesting way of preserving the deceased.",
          "Having read the reviews prior, it was more or less as expected and worth the \u20ac3. As others have said, the lack of information spoils it.",
          "The respectful displays of the many deads in various states of decay and mummifaction are a reminder of our own mortality. There is absolutely no show aspect to the catacombs; the Capuchins are just monks respecting and taking care of the dead, whether they are monks, civilians,",
          "Not for the faint-hearted. It\u2019s like you stepped on set for Tales from the Crypt. It\u2019s seriously creepy and you wouldn\u2019t want to get trapped in there for a power outage but well worth the visit in my eyes and at \u20ac3 pretty cheap too. There are hundreds of bodies/skeletons in",

          "Forget the Egyptians. If you want to see mummies. This is the place. Extremely interesting. I was beside myself on the thought process of wanting your remains displayed like they were.",
          "Strangely beautiful and calming - A very unique experience, I expected to be unsettled, but found the visit strangely calming...the silence, the history, the close up view of those that have gone before....don't be put off, worth the visit!!",
          "We visited the Catacombe dei Cappuccino while in Palermo. It was pretty interesting although a bit macabre. the bodies are hung on the wall clothed and 'staring' at you.",
          "Do not miss this place. Maybe the only one in the world of this kind. Bodies were preserved using a different method. Some stay in very good condition. Amazing. Not the same feeling when you see it live than in a photo or video. You need a car to get there. Located away from",
          "A place for Day of the Dead Lovers, with real mummified skeletons on display -- not those artful ones you see in Mexico. This is a real tomb with real bodies. If Memento Mori is your passion, this is a must-see.",
          "Wandering the mummified remains makes one wonder about one's own mortality and is a thought provoking place to visit. Well worth it.",
          "It\u2019s something you won\u2019t see again and it was an experience to visit. You could touch almost them, you were that close at times. It is a walk of 1km after getting off the hop on hop off bus at stop 7 on the red line or you can drive and park out front if you wish. I wouldn\u2019t",
          "If you decide to visit the catacombs, I think you\u2019ll agree that this is one of the weirdest \u201ctourist sites\u201d you will have ever seen. It could be described as voyeuristic, if not lurid, but if you want to explore a huge underground vault with eight thousand mummified bodies from",
          "Got to be honest I didn\u2019t quite get this or see the point. Lots of skeletons on display in clothing. It\u2019s quite a walk outside of the main sites but doable if you\u2019ve got the will or the time. If your sight seeing I guess you have to go but it just didn\u2019t really inspire me. No",
          "Do a pre-read before visiting. We took a taxi to the place from our hotel (it seems taxi drivers in Palermo charge 20 euro to take you to a place or back). There was no crowd at the entrance and we visited with no hustle on a business day. It seemed there were parking places",
          "You can\u2019t witness something like they anywhere else in the world. The catacombs are huge with a crazy amount of mommies dating from 1599 to the 1900s. Some of them are incredibly well maintenez and it\u2019s a creepy yet amazing experience to visit it. It\u2019s my highlight in Palermo.",
          "We knew what we were getting into, but the scope of the place was incredible. It was vast. Hundreds upon hundreds of monks and others spending eternity. Dying and knowing you would be reunited with your brethren must give some comfort to the living, but that conviction is",
          "These catacombs started in the sixteenth century. Unfortunately no photographs allowed. Entrance fee is \u20ac3 per person, served by a monk. The place is full of skulls which are put onto straw bodies which are dressed in garments. Most skulls are in tact, some have a missing cheek",
          "It is morbid, but I have never see so many dead bodies! They are propped up alongside the walkways by their families in their best costumes for all to see. Simply amazing.",
          "We visited on a national holiday, so the area was buzzing. The catacombs were open with a small entrance fee. The inhabitants were in various states of decomposition and attire. The majority appeared to be from just after the unification of Italy. There is a balance between the",
          "We knew this was a left field choice, but we were still surprised by what we saw. Definitely not for the feint hearted or children. If you are into horror movies this may be up your street.",
          "Walk downstairs and you are immediately greeted but a long collection of corpses hanging on the walls. We found it interesting and certainly unique, more than other churches with similar collections. Would have benefitted from a small introduction to what this all meant and how",
          "It takes a couple of buses to get here but it is worth the effort. The catacombs are expansive with several hundred \"residents\" on display. Because this is a reverent sacred place, photos are not permitted although there always seem to be a few self entitled individuals who",
          "Admittedly I'm no expert on the catacombs of Europe, but in this place I felt uncomfortable, yet respectful. It was quiet when I was there, and that probably added to the atmosphere. There were many remains in various states of preservation. It's a place I will definitely",
          "No stories, no descriptions, nothing interesting. Literally rows of bones, bones and some straw in clothes. Meh.",
          "A fair walk out of the town and unfortunately just timed so they had closed. Visited the interesting cemetery attached with Ornate crypts housing families.",
          "We track down ossuaries and bone crypts across Europe (still have many to do!). These catacombs are amongst the best. So many mummies on display. No photos allowed (although that doesn't seem to stop loads ending up on Instagram). Well worth a visit if you're into the obscure,",
          "An odd and disturbing, yet strangely fascinating visit. Dozens of dead people, preserved by having their innards removed then washed in vinegar or arsenic, then dressed in their clothes and kept in the catacombs. Centuries of people in different forms of attire, the poor,",
          "Booked this tour through our cruise ship, imagining an underground crypt with coffins. We were shocked to find corpses hanging from the walls. Bit taken aback but found it moving and quite sad. Our 11 year old son was amazed by it. Not creepy or scary but truly a different tour",
          "You won\u2019t see anything like this place anywhere else! We thought we would be going in and seeing graves and crypts and when we went round the corridor we were shocked. It was so interesting and not what we expected! My dad was talking about it for days afterward! We got there 15",
          "This is quite a distance out of the old town compared to other tourist destinations, but is well worth the walk. Make sure you look at the opening times carefully so you don\u2019t arrive when it is shut. The entrance price is a bargain at \u20ac3. We were really pleased to find that the",
          "I did not enjoy the visit to this place, as the energy here was so negative. Obviously, it would be so with all the dead bodies around. This place is worth a visit to remind ourselves that we are just a bundle of bones who will leave this earth soon!! Rosalia looked fresh and",
          "About a quarter hour walk from the Norman Palace, this is a fascinating place. It is not very well signposted but we eventually managed to find it although you can dropped off there on the city bus tours. Set out in corridors of monks, professionals, women, children, etc there",
          "What can I say? Wall to wall mummies, in their burial dress, posed, categorized by \"virgins\", \"priests\" and whatnot. This is not your bandage covered Egyptian kind of mummy, I can tell you! I thought I had seen a lot ...and then I came here. I recommend it. You won't forget",
          "It is a creepy, but an interesting experience. You can see skeletons from 1840 up to 1940 and also the famous Rosalia, the well-preserved corpse of the little girl. It is better if you read about the place before, so you can understand more about the burials and mummification",
          "Macabre place, remote of the main city. These are not mummies but merely sceletons, dried out human remains with one side broken open coffins to make them visible. The more, be very vigilant for theft in that part of the city, do not walk around, better go by taxi instead of",
          "We wanted to visit the catacombs expecting to get more information about the place once on site. The lack of information about the remains subtracts from this unique experience. After returning to my hotel I read about the burials and mummification process. Knowing this before",
          "This was an interesting experience. There was a totally different energy than outside under the sun. It's amazing to see how preserved some of the mummies are. The only thing that bothered me was that quite a few visitors were taking pictures (with flash) even though there were",
          "The museum has the biggest selection of mummies in the world and you experience a different type of just a simple visit to a museum. The mummies are placed in a every single wall of the catacombs and are categorised according to the sex,age or social status. They wear their own",
          "It may sound macabre but my wife had wanted to see this for many years and she wasnt disappointed. Weird, wacky, sad, amazing all at the same time. The colours of the clothes on the corpses have faded but she would still highly recommend it. Get a taxi from the centre. If you",
          "Hard to review to be honest but I think it is one of them things that you want the experience of seeing but wouldn't be rushing back. Cheap entry. A very eerie experience but fascinating at the same time. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a bit squeamish or children.",
          "Visited today by myself since I could not get anyone to visit with me. It does not take a lot of time, so if you are short on time it is a good choice.",
          "I really wouldn\u2019t take children! This is the kind of place that would have given me nightmares as a kid. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for was not only how many corpses there are in the catacombs, but also the fact that most of them are stood up. Well, hung up, attached to the walls.",
          "Free parking right in front of this hidden gem, cheap and not crowded at all. Hundreds of mummified bodies. Too bad there\u2019s no English information, besides the sections they made (males, females, kids, babies and monks). No photo and video allowed.",
          "I don't know if I can recommend this place. It is gruesome, the stuff of nightmares and is just body after body in the final decayed skeleton. Occasional stretches of skin, teeth and hair. Clothed and stuffed with straw and it is so dusty. Children also in this state. It",
          "We had read about this place and decided to go. I didn't realise quite how many bodies there were. It was extremely strange, but at the same time incredibly fascinating. Some of the bodies were only bones, but some still had their teeth and amazingly some still had hair - not",
          "It is definitely worth to visit catacombs. We did not feel any disturbance or disgust - there are thousands of corpses in the condition of mummy or skeleton, these people have been dead since more than 100 years so no one expects to see dead bodies. It was weird trend to be",
          "Was not too sure that I wanted to see the Catacombs, but did want to see all that is relevant to the history of Palermo. We stopped off on the way back from Monreale. It is cheap to get in, and the queue soon goes down. We did not linger for long, and avoided the passage way",
          "A really unusual place to visit. Some would find it disturbing but if you\u2019re interested in memento mori it\u2019s worth a wander round. I found it fascinating.",
          "Feels a little morbid but fascinating none the less! Took a while to find as we got lost but was glad we visited.",
          "I can\u2019t agree with the reviews that say it is a \u201cmust see\u201d, my brother and I found it rather boring. Yes it\u2019s cheap to get in but after you\u2019ve seen 1 mummified body you\u2019ve seen them all and with no English translations, the historical facts were lost on us.",
          "The condition of the remains in the catacombs is dreadful, the entire experience is macabre and feels very disrespectful.",
          "Today we visited the catacombes with some thousands of mummified bodies displayed around multiple corridors dating from about 1700s to 1920s. It was an interesting if slightly weird experience. What was of interest to my wife was the beautiful lace that some of the corpses were",
          "An interesting place to visit, but not easy to get your head round at all, knowing these are just shells of the people they had once been and especially sad to see so many children. A quiet thoughtful time afterwards is essential to consider what you have seen, it\u2019s not",
          "A place where you really feel the memento mori. At the same time you are aware of your mortality and your life. It's not a place for everybody, so skip it if you're not sure.",
          "Our cruise ship was rerouted from Malta to Palermo due to bad weather so at the last minute we decided to go to the Catacombs of Palermo.The sight of 8000 skeleons and skulls in their original finery is not everyones cup of tea but it is a fascinating one hour experience and",
          "I thought it was going to be just a few dry bones and some skulls. But this was jaw-droppingly macabre. The bodies are in coffins, standing upright, in niches and literally hanging from the wall. All in various stages of mummification and all dressed in their Sunday best, which",
          "I had looked forward to visiting the catacombs and from arriving i was disappointed that there was no change in temperature and no earthiness which can be found in other catacombs i have visited. Even though i knew what to expect i am unsure if this is little more than a tourist",
          "My wife and I walked to the Crypt. Only 3 euro entrance fee. It was well worth it. We saw bodies in there from 1599. They have the bodies arranged from men, women, children, professional...etc. Some of these people still have skin, hair, beards, and eyebrows. Worth the trip to",
          "Interesting to read all the varied reviews on the Cappuchins. It's not going to suit everybody but it's well worth experiencing this unique place. Yes it's strange. Anything to do with death is uncomfortable. Especially being able to view it as it is presented to us here. This",
          "Certainly this place is unique but it is really rather grim. As so many people have remarked these were real people and I am amazed that there are visitors with small children here. I have been here twice, first time as it was said to be a Must See and the second time travelling",
          "It says its a must see in palermo but unsure if we made the right desision to go what you must realise is these are people not mumies and youre in very close proximety to them although faconating as they are in the actual clothes from that time i personally felt as though we",
          "Visited for second time the catacombes, but still scarry those skulls and all kind of bones. I think that this place is unique and you have to visit it.",
          "The view of thousands of skeletons is quite scarying and is not for everyone. The location is quite outside the city center. I got the negative impression that although it was not allowed to make photos inside ( because it is not appropriate to make photos of deceased people)",
          "Visited here on an excursion to Monreale and Palermo. I was rather taken aback when we first went in, mainly by the sheer size of the catacombs and number of bodies. It was fascinating ,in a macabre sort of way, to see them wearing clothes which reflected their professions etc.",
          "Everyone says to visit and half the party thought it worthwhile half disliked it. Yes its a set of mummies and they aren't Egyptian - not vampire material Do check the opening times at the lunch period as there is very little shade to wait/queue for ticket office. If timing is",
          "What an unusual place , spooky and macabre. But loved looking around .My highlight of Palermo.An easy walk there and back using google maps Cheap as well 3 euros each . Opened at 15.00",
          "This got my attention and was something I just had to see. I read the history of it before going . It began in the 1600\u2019s when the burial ground was full and they decided to mummify the Brother who had died so they could continue to be with him.My husband and I walked here from",
          "To be honest I was pretty disappointed - it is a kind of cript (catacombe is a little too much to title) with a lot of skeletons dressed. From ethnographic and historical fashion point of view might be interesting, otherwise is a kind of memento mori - the proof that after",
          "We visited the catacomb but it is not for the faint hearted It was weird and a once off experience for me I did not understand the language but i recommend you get a tour guide to assist if this is on your bucket lust",
          "Guess I'm biased as this was the whole reason to visit Palermo. Did not disappoint, so incredibly interesting. Get there early to wander round in wonder and respectfully before the hordes of buses arrive. It's open for 3 hours morning and afternoon. Sit in one of the free",
          "But well worth the experience. The place is extremely creepy, looking at mummified bodies, that have mostly been so well preserved, is quite unnerving. Some are in better condition than others. Most are noted and some history is given, more would have been good. I guess they",
          "You can take your time and see everything in 45 minutes. Preety cool in a dark tourism way. It's a bit outside the historical area. Could have done with more information on why, when and who. I think they were more interested in selling their guide. Note the times are 9:00-1:00",
          "I've seen mummies before. but this museum is a very different experience. Believe me, you want to look at the mummies one by one. Very interesting. babies, women, guys... No photography allowed. Visitors were taking a secret photo. Some of them have eyelashes, eyebrows or even",

          "This site is just a few euro to enter, and it is well preserved and managed. Expect to see literally hundreds of full skeletons in era dress. There is also a section of deceased children fully dressed in their age appropriate garb. We did not stay long here, as it was not our",
          "No need of many words.. fantastic experience for 3\u20ac in Palermo. Make sure you are brave enough and .... MEMENTO MORI.",
          "Horrible, skeletons of babies displayed in the wide open (still in their cots in some cases) without any covering. No plaques or information to elaborate on any of the bodies, just endless rows of remains. The morbidity aside, it was a very boring and brief activity, not helped",
          "Very interesting to see the exhibits and how well some of them have lasted given the age of them since being placed in the tomb. You could imagine them jumping off the wall to the sound of Michael Jackson's Thriller. The young child in the case looks as though asleep and very",
          "Only a small exhibit but quite fascinating in a macabre way. Well worth an hour of your time. To think the corpses etc were 200 years old , but some were remarkably intact. The site is actually a place of remembrance and once you get round this, it becomes less spooky. One",
          "This is the busiest we have seen anywhere in our 3 days visiting Palermo. 3 Euro per person- paid to a monk- will get you to see at least 8000 dead remains including \u201cvirgins, professionals, clergy\u201d and other interesting categories as described by the attraction. When the",
          "This is an amazing display of corpses, most incredibly well preserved. A must see for us although others many wonder. It is important not to consider walking here, as we did. This is not a good idea as suddenly big roads with many people around turn into very run down areas",
          "Really peculiar place. Only 3\u20ac, and you walk around it in about 30 minutes. What I found interesting was the clothes on the mummies. Really gave an indication of the time period these people lived in. Eventually had to escape though for fresh air. The cemetery next door is",
          "My husband and I had heard a lot about the catacombs and decided to walk from Palermo via Via Cappucini which took approx 20 minutes. On arrival it's quite uninspiring just a doorway with a sign and a small queue nothing ornate about the church attached. It was \u20ac3 entrance",
          "Very cheap to go in (\u20ac3) and just an odd place. Apparently you are not allowed to take photos but I saw several people doing it. I hope so don\u2019t have weird dreams later tonight. Worth checking out - will take around 30-40 min to go through. There is no info provided at entry.",

          "What a marvellous place! This is a crypt underneath an old monastery, where in the 16thC, the monks discovered they could mummify their dead. And they did. By the 17thC it started to be fashionable (not sure why) to be entombed there after death. The result is seen here; 8000",
          "If your into looking at dead people hanging around your cellar this is the place to visit, in all honesty it is very interesting and a must if in the area.. I wouldn\u2019t suggest taking kids as nightmares may follow.",
          "Interesting to see, but not as moving or indeed as macabre as I might have imagined. Too much a tourist attraction and too far removed from the Cappucin community to have the meaning it is meant to possess.",
          "I have to admit seeing all of those skeletons was a bit intense. Our guide Alan had a lot of knowledge on the subject. However it was a bit difficult to understand him at times because of his heavy accent and his tone was low. However the other guide Sean was clear and also",
          "Very disappointed, after visiting the catacombes in Naples and the underground attraction in Naples we expected something better. The skeletons are dressed in dated clothing and are stuffed with STRAW too fill out the body shapes. This looks odd and not authentic. It's takes",
          "This ranks up there with the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini on the Via Veneto in Rome. Not for the squeamish but fascinating the way everyone is hung and placed according to their occupations. The children are especially haunting.",
          "Having visited other catacombs I though I was prepared for here, but I did not expect to see so many bodies so old and so well preserved (especially as the it is not particularly cold). I would have rated it 5 stars but there is little information given so I would suggest you",
          "Some will like it some not. 8000 dead people can make impression if you accept it. The little, 2 y.o. girl embalmed 100 years ago can be considered spectacular. Decide yourself if you like such attractions. No photo inside.",
          "This place exceeded all my expectations and even my bf who wasn't convinced to go and look for it with me, was happy to experience it in the end. Strangely it is and it is not scary. But it truly is a fascinating place. It may seem creepy, but you learn a lot and it makes you",
          "I don't doubt for a second that the costume and set designers of the Indiana Jones movies must have visited here for both inspiration and research. To learn that the Capuchin Monks began placing the members of their order here in 1599, at a time when bodies of the holy were",

          "Macabre but fascinating place to visit. Not for the feint hearted but an experience that you will never forget.",
          "The bodies are described as mummified, but in reality, the majority are only bones. I found how these corpses have been turned into a tourist attraction disrespectful and a little disturbing. I wondered if these people would still want to be here if they could see what it has",
          "Some would say that I should expect to see open mummies on a public display if I choose to go and see the Catacombs. That is the purpose of the visit of this place, after all. However it seemed to be for me too much packed with amazingly big amount of mummies on the small",
          "This was an interesting visit. It was strange to get to, but we felt safe the entire way walking there. It was also a nice way to see the side streets of Palermo. The catacombs were very interesting. It is a low ceiling getting down there, but it is set up quite well, with a",
          "Lucky the entry fee is only three euros because I couldn\u2019t wait to get out. Row after row of decomposed bodies, and of course the \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d a embalmed body of a small child. Wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a must see, but certainly very different to the norm.",
          "Worth a visit to get an insight into the complex relationship that Sicilians have with death. Not for the faint hearted!",
          "I payed a fee of 3 euros to see corpses of monks, musicians, teachers, and other people that are burried there. I thought it was a catacombe only for monks, something historic and mysterious. I lost my time...",
          "Good value for money at 3 euros, slightly unsettling but very interesting and worth a visit. The preservation witnessed is fascinating",
          "Not in many other place in the word you can face the death in this way Experience to try. Unforgettable",
          "This is one of the strangest and most fascinating things I have seen in my whole life. It is so special and different. I totally recommend everyone to visit, because this is as close as you will come to death without dying.",
          "This place is something special, not typical touristic attraction. I personally liked it, never seen something like this. Dark and mystic, provoking thoughts. You are silent at this place and it feels like in a movie. 3\u20ac entrance and parking in front.",
          "The catacombs was a very special experience. Seeing all the dead people, familyes and even premature born children was spectacular. The best kept body, Rosalita who died only two years old and who still are in good condition was magic. Recommended place to visit when in",
          "First time into a catacomb of any sort. Yeah, full of dead bodies, organised in sections too. Little English explanations so just a show of corpses in dress. The entrance to the place is rather non-descript; looks like a odds-and-ends stall as it is located next to a souvenir",
          "Very powerful place to visit. Makes you really consider mortality. Absolutely fascinating. At only \u20ac3 for entry its well worth a visit. No photos allowed which is only right showing respect for the dead.",
          "We walked here from our old town hotel, took a little finding and we arrived at 1pm without realising it shut for a few hours over dinner. No problem as the cafe nearby is great. Now it's hard to put in to words how someone else might feel viewing the people in here, it's",
          "Worth the twenty-minute walk out of the city centre to visit this unique experience. It's just 3\u20ac to visit and spend forty minutes exploring the history of the city through the people that used to live there.",
          "Having seen many catacombs I have never seen one like this. The bodies are on display in their burial clothes & most are very well preserved. The clothing is interesting to see from a social history point of view. There are children as well as adults, but they are all shown in a",
          "A short drive by taxi from Palermo's City Centre, the Catacombs of the Cappuccino monks , is worth an hour of your time. We had seen most other attractions in Palermo so going here was \"icing on the cake\". Seeing this vast underground cemetery is a unique, macabre attraction.",
          "I found this visit to be very interesting and quite different from what I\u2019ve seen in my travels, but lacked in providing information; there\u2019s very little signage and what exists is in Italian only. Do your research beforehand in order to get more out of your visit, but do go as",
          "Both interesting and a little creepy. Not sure how valid many of these are, as there is no audio tour nor any information in the catacombs to explain. Essentially, it\u2019s just \u201chere\u2019s a bunch of skeletons, enjoy\u201d kind of thing. I wish I knew more about many of the halls, but I can",
          "Nowhere else will you experience a spine chilling \u2018touch\u2019 of those who passed away a long time ago. We went there with young children, which gave us chance to discuss the less mortal aspects of life. Having said that, I still believe isn\u2019t a place for the faint-hearted.",
          "Interesting in a historical point of view but not suitable for small children as I found it a bit full on skeleton after skeleton all dressed and very ghoulish ! Just wantedto get out .",
          "The catacombes are completely opened and, weird detail, the body are pretty much all hung on the wall. Impressive to see the natural mummification process and the details that those mummies give us about the past. Not for sensitive people though!! One thing: if you visit, please",
          "We took 2 buses to get there from the train station and paid a very reasonable \u20ac3 entrance each. No photogralhy or videography allowed as a mark of respect to the dead. A haunting and memorable experience. The natural mumification process was fascinating to read about on their",
          "Not a place to visit for the faint hearted or any one who might suffer from claustrophobia... but I would not hv missed it for the world. It is anazing to be able to walk around and let your imagination take you back into the lives of so many different eras . Keep in mind this",
          "Although I am sure a certain type of visitor may find this dreadful place interesting, it certainly wasn\u2019t for me .. I find places like this quite sad and a bit, well.. gruesome !! With so many wonderful things to see and visit in Palermo , simply don\u2019t understand why anyone",
          "Do not miss this catacombs if you are in Palermo. Everywhere skulls bones. Nice experience you will see how you will be look like 200 years later.",
          "If you are visiting Palermo, one of the things that can be done in this city is visiting Catacombe dei Cappuccini. It is a strange place, has about 8000 mummies. I recommend you to read about this place before entering.",
          "I would not say I am particularly ghoulish but this was interesting and slightly disturbing at the same time. There are rows of corpses some hung some laid out all in full dress of the period. The corpses are preserved in the caves following the Cappuccini traditions which",
          "I can't say that it was a top priority for me, but my travel pal, my cousin really wanted to go, so we walked over to see the famous Catacombe dei Cappuccini.. It's only 3 euros. The best buy was the 10 euro book on Sicily's art & history that was sold at the entrance.. Some",
          "We chose a guided tour through Sicilandays.com. Our guide, Patrizia picked us up, took us to the catacombs giving us detailed information of the why, the how and the when of the history of the catacombs. A weird insight into ancient beliefs and a less than respectful way to be",
          "Not as big as I thought it would be but very interesting and for 3 euros entrance fee really good value loved it",
          "Interesting place to visit. Not to expensive to get in only \u20ac3. Pretty amazing to see it all. Wouldn't recommending taking children there unless they are a bit more mature or able to show respect and be controlled. A shame about the people who disrespect things and take photo's",
          "Hundreds of mummies and human skeletons on display. Read about the place before u visit. It is quite a walk from the centre of town. Three euro entry. Worth a visit",
          "Wow... what an unusual thing. Mummified corpses dating back to the late 1500s to the late 1800s some are amazingly well preserved. Not sure I would take a sensitive child there but i found it really interesting.",
          "It is macabre and scary, but it is also most fascinating to view where the old religious and societal practices lead at some stage, and how relative our beliefs are. Then it was desired, now seems a disrespect, but there we are: the collection of the dead in their best attire,",
          "Strange creepy place. We were two couples and our friends liked the place very much, but for me and my husband it was too creepy with all the corpse hanging from the walls. Anyway it great place to start exploring Palermo if you are with car. The parking in front is free (not",

          "We looked at some of the tours offered then just googled it to learn as much as we wanted/needed to know and then just paid the 3 Euro/person entrance fee and went through. Frankly, a tour would have kept us down there longer than we needed to stay. It\u2019s very macabre and",
          "A creepy place completely abandoned to itself! No explanations, no flyers or guide able to let you understand why the place exists and its history! Ah, of course you can\u2019t take any pictures but you can buy their posta cards set! The frati must be very proud of how they got",
          "Probably 20 minutes is about enough. There are only so many dead bodies and mummified corpses I\u2019d need to see before it all becomes a blur. About \u20ac3 entrance fee.",
          "Strange place to visit. Lots of dressed skeletons standing up and staring back at you. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "If you like the macabre, you'll like this place. It's got fully dressed skeletons that are standing up. It's a short visit.",
          "This is a great catacombs to visit. It is amazing how well the bodies are preserved, right down to hair and skin still being on them. It is a wonderful walk through history to look at the clothes of the time, the burial techniques. I would caution anyone from bringing small",
          "If you love dried Italian salami or dried apricots you will love this tour. Dried bodies dressed for a party. Why not!",
          "I still do not understand why all these \"mummies\" are kept in this place. Can be horrifying for children.",
          "interesting to discover how some bodies are be preserved but after half hour it's really enough. Good for scientists.",
          "An unforgettable experience. Macabre to some and moving for others. The catacombs are easily walkable (although mostly uphill) from central Palermo although in places the curbs are narrow and so you have to watch for passing traffic. They ask that you don\u2019t take photographs",
          "It was an eerie feeling walking through. The tour was very informative and interesting. I know my wife and I had a strange feeling as we walked through. I would highly recommend making sure you are okay with seeing human remains displayed. It is very interesting but seeing this",
          "Poorly signposted so hard to find even on foot. Entire experience is something that has seen far better days and has not been maintained in spite of significant amounts of money being poured into it some years ago. Not worth the entrance fee.",
          "It\u2019s hard to sum up really! It\u2019s interesting, but a bit uncomfortably so, not much information on offer, it\u2019s really just a lot of bodies hanging from the walls & piled up.. and I mean lots of them (it\u2019s bigger than you might anticipate). As it is, it just feels like a macabre",
          "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so confronted with my own mortality. Its actually hard to digest that your really viewing long dead people at various stages of decomposition. I was mesmerised, fascinated and uncomfortable all at the same time. It was hard to believe this wasn\u2019t",

          "\u20ac3 to walk around underground catacombs to look at 8000 bodies, strung up against the walls in various forms of decomposition. Very strange. You can get quite close to the bodies, just a railing between. Interesting to see how well preserved the clothes are. Not sure what",
          "far from the city center and not too much to see, just burial place, not a lot of archaeological stricture or historical info. not recommended as tourist attraction",

          "It took as a while to find it walking as I trusted my google map and after many wrong turns we found the place much easier to go up the straight road past the Palace. When we went down to the Cattacombs I nearly turned back at the sight of so many dead bodies but after the long",
          "What to expect at Catacombs. Ok. I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this place before. And I loved it. BUT BE WARNED. There is no point in glossing over it. It\u2019s a giant crypt. Skeletons hang from the walls. Skeletons lie in coffins. Men. Women. Children.",
          "Just kidding! It is not what you expect at first. It takes a few seconds to understand that you are actually in the right place. Don't take a tour. Go on your own or get a bus and take a five minute walk. People are friendly and helpful. Do not waste your money on a taxi. The",

          "I actually had no idea what these Catacombes were when my tour group was brought here. Once upon a time, people of means paid serious money to be drained of liquids, stuffed with straw, then dressed up to be hung on hooks on these walls so their families could visit them. As",
          "I loved the place, the atmosphere and its history. It is also fascinating to see how the people wanted to be dressed in death.",
          "I guess some people like it, I don't. Too walk down in the catacombes to look at dead people isn't anything for me. I paid the entrance fee, walked in, but turned after 50 meters and left.",
          "I have been to different catacombs and this one was different in that all the skeletons were dressed. I went with my 9 yo daughter and it was not too creepy for her.",
          "You cannot take pictures here, but the people that have been preserved, some over 200 years ago, is astonishing. We just walked through it with our mouths open.",
          "The catacombs are a fascinating view of the departed placed fully clothed on racks against the walls of this large subterranean burial chamber. The bodies are dried and mummified over time. Priests, monks, professionals and even children haunt the halls here all in evolving",
          "Having seen the catacombs and crypts in Rome and Paris this was high on my to do list for Sicily. The admission price is so low only 3 Euros and the location is far from the bustling other tourist attractions. This was a once in a lifetime experience, there are so many bodies",
          "My wife had some reservations about visiting the catacombs, but we were both fascinated by this unique if somewhat strange site. Not at all 'spooky' as you might imagine, but quite moving to see how human remains have been 'stored' and looked after.",
          "The order of Capuchin Friars dates back to the 1500\u2019s and this abbey was dedicated to their usage. Whilst the abbey itself is not a fantastic building, the catacombs are the true marvel and are not like any other attraction in Europe. Here you will travel underground into the",
          "This was quite an adventure to get to....however it was worth it. It is the marked like a tourist attraction, but it was awesome. Some of the skeletons even had hair. It was freaky...but so interesting to read about the origins or see the dressing of those buried. Not to be",
          "Very macabre and unique. I actually found the clothes the corpses were wearing to be interesting. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it for children or people who get grossed out easily.",
          "Be respectful when you come here, first of all. It's a little creepy to see dressed skeletons hanging off the walls, but interesting still. It's sad the state of decay they are in with limbs missing and such. Especially sad are the children who died so young and obviously were",
          "More hundreds of mummified bodies can be seen here from all age. Very unique sanctuary place where only rich persons were buried.",
          "I have rated this as very good because it is so extraordinary and really rather creepy. Having visited catacombs in Rome and now in Palermo I feel that I have seen enough!",
          "A very unique experience. I am not aware of any other catacombs that have been used up until the mid 20thC, and the fact that all the bodies are in original clothing is all the more fascinating. For just 3 Euros entrance fee this is a very worthwhile visit.",
          "It\u2019s not everyday you stroll into a place like this for 3Eur. Spent about 20 mins walking around. Fascinating but very plain. It would have been nice to have some more info during the visit (no signs actually explaining what you are seeing).",
          "Something between a museum and a slightly nightmarish dream. The rows of dead people stare at you from the walls, room after room. You wonder what it would be like to visit the place at night, with a candle in your hand...",
          "What can one say This place is unique I still don\u2019t know what to make of it I didn\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the point This is a different cultures way of dealing with the dead Amazing",
          "The place is generally interesting to see, but I would love to receive any historical background about this place, some information about people buried here. The way it is now makes the place feel very non-personal, things you see don't stay in your mind. It is simply like",
          "It was a special place for my Palermo Trip. I never saw something similar. Of course, we speak about a macabre attraction, but this mix of feelings could have once on a lifetime. Many bodies is in a good condition and for some of them the preservation were spectacular. We could",
          "These catacombs are fascinating and well worth a vist. The bodies are mainly monks And later they mummified locals. The locals would come dress them and pray for their souls.",
          "This is a reasonably popular attraction adjacent to a busy cemetery. It is a bizarre catacomb where the residents are fixed to the walls in a standing position. Rosalia Lombardo, the little two year old interred here in a glass case is often visited. This place can be",

          "This Is well worth a visit. It isn't for the faint hearted and I'm unsure if it. Is suitable for small children. It's only 3 euro entry. Little bit of a walk to pop into google maps and you will be there in no time . We spent about 15 min there.",
          "I visited here out of curiosity after seeing something on TV about it a while ago. It was rather scary and seemed like the dead were observing you but also interesting to see the clothing from the past. There was a section for children and also for virgins. Some of the",
          "I\u2019ve never seen such a place before! It\u2019s kind of scary but interesting at the same time. You should go there, if you have enough time. Entrance is not that expensive - 5\u20ac I guess",
          "Went to this after seeing on British TV, it was October 31 (the day of the dead / All Hallows Eve) st which added to the atmosphere. It is spooky and interesting in equal measure seeing the dead peer down on you or at your hight. The ded are organised into themes by profession",
          "If you have never been to catacombs this will leave you speechless. The mummified bodies of hundreds of Sicilians hang along the walls of the cave corridors, leaving you feeling very humbled by the history and ceased life surrounding you. They have organized the bodies by",
          "Many cultures have prepared and preserved the bodies of their loved ones. Sicily is no exception and this particular set of catacombs is well worth the visit. We have visited catacombs in Peru as well and these are equally memorable. Somehow we missed the most famous",
          "An early morning start meant that we were at the catacombs before the full lighting was switched on! Very spooky, very interesting with hundreds of dead bodies.No make that 8,000 dead bodies Within a short space of time the remains became well lit . Arranged in categories",
          "This site is ok for most people. However i did see one weeping lady looking at the preserved child who is now better protected under glass.The most interesting aspect is the costumes of the period (unless your a dentist!). There is easy access and natural light from the windows",
          "The catacombes in Palermo is wild. I have never been so freaked out. Being a walking dead fan, this place will really give you the jitters. It's amazing to see all the dead people hanging either from the walls or laying down. You can still see the skin on some of the",
          "I was very excited to see this place, I found it here on TripAdvisor and I was looking forward to it as it\u2019s something extraordinary and rare. I was surprised, there were much more dead bodies than I expected and closer than I thought. Even though you are not allowed to touch it",
          "This ranks high on the sites to see in Palermo, quite odd and probably unique in the world. if you are scarred then don't go as an aerie feeling - however we all end up this way but not necessarily on view",
          "Go early, we went for opening time and had the catacombs to ourselves which made it especially eerie and poignant. Its a weird, weird place. A must for anyone interesting in different histories and social cultures. We walked round twice to take it all in and believe our eyes...",
          "This is one of those places that it is fun to see, but also is a little poignant. The catacombs are filled with skeletons, shrouded and clothed- a bit like scarecrows. They grin down and out on you from there shelves, hands crossed, heads turned- slightly disheveled from being",
          "The catacombs are among the highlights in Palermo, make sure not to miss it. Make sure also to read a little bit in before hand as you won't get any explanatory information once inside. The stage of preservation of some of the mummies is quite stunning and yes, after a while it",
          "a 20 minute walk from Quatro Canti and you find yourself in a residential district housing the catacombs. You pay at the desk and descend down into what is more like a crypt with daylight from windows at ceiling height. The catacombs are smaller than expected but how many",
          "Other cultivated visitors expressed already concerns and I would echo some. Interior ist not really protected against light, dust, dirt, flashlights and touchy fingers. I wonder why no aircondition is preventing the atmosphere to destroy the fascinating relicts. Double the entry",
          "Remarkable site, outside of downtown Palermo. We visited multiple catacombs in Sicily, but this is the only one with the residents still present. A unique place to visit.",
          "Well signed as a little way outside the city centre but easily walkable It was a shame that there was no information leaflet before going in. We checked out Wikipedia after viewing and the info was very interesting On entry the sight is quite shocking and quite creepy. It",
          "We visited the Catacombs in Palermo. Amazing how some of the bodies remain intact. Lots of history, and great souvenirs available after you finish viewing the Catacombs, I recommend to visit.",
          "Great to see one of many catacombs. Human remains moved. Not for the clostrephobic tho underground in darkened alleys or should I say tombs",
          "went here on a whim. This is a museum which was originally the burial place of Capuchin monks and then over time expanded to include local people from Palermo. Skeletons of me, women and children all dressed up. After a while it gets boring. If you like the macabre go, if not",
          "We went to visit the catacombs because we\u2019d read about them, but being down there is a whole different story. The atmosphere with hundreds of dead bodies surrounding you takes you to a weird place. I really enjoyed the visit, and Rosalia is just incredible. You have to see this.",
          "This is a very strange place to visit. Its quite creepy but it was a unique experiance. It takes around half an hour to walk around, longer if you stop to look 'people' in detail. It gives you an idea of how people wanted to be remembered in thier clothing, which is a",
          "Extremely fascinating, however this is not for everyone as some of the \"items\" on display can be a little disturbing or even creepy. Not for persons who are susceptible to bad dreams.",
          "Not for the faint-hearted, but a very interesting experience. You can secretly snatch a photo or two.",
          "The site does not have any explanatory signs which is a shame but it is still worth a visit especially as you can read up on it prior to visiting. 30 mins is more than enough to roam around - pictures aren't allowed",
          "The place is what it is, do not venture in if you are quesy about certain things. I enjoyed going around the place respectfully, the only thing that marred my visit were a couple of tourists who were treating it more like a freak show. More attendants should be available in",
          "Why do we as a species like to look at our own dead? I thought about that long and hard as we spent 40 minutes or so wandering around this creepy but compelling place. Perfect for teenagers to help them take on board some facts of life (death), and fascinating in the way it is",
          "If you're in Palermo don't miss the opportunity to visit the catacombs. Not for everyone I know but I was enthralled.",
          "It was a quite exciting visit at Palermo Capuchins Catacombs. Not for everyone and don't go there if you are very sensitive. Long lines of preserved bodies from last few centuries. It's difficult to say that it is amazing but truly the numbers and the fact that there are bodies",
          "3 euro in. It they don't really check tickets so u could sneak in About 2 km from centre Very good ounce you are not afraid of lots of dead bodies Very well done No photos allowed but you can sneak a few but cameras everywhere",
          "Definitely worth the visit - a different experience to see the mummies lining the wall and so close. It was a hot day when we went and even though it was under ground it was still hot so take a portable fan with you if you have one! This is one of those places that you will",
          "This is a place where the living meets the dead, with over 8000 bodies mummified and displayed. It is an unnerving experience to walk among them. The saddest part is looking at the children and babies who have died, especially the remains of Rosalia Lombardo who looks as if she",
          "Many catacombs have only the slots cut in the stone where the corpses once rested but this one is very different. Basically they are halls of hanging corpses - fastened by the neck to pegs on the walls. The skeletons are dressed as they were when they were brought to this",
          "These are one of those places that you either love or hate. It's clearly filled with hundreds of bodies dressed in their clothes. Some even have mummified skin so you can get a better idea of what the corpse would have looked like in life. Most distressing is seeing the small",
          "Well if you need a reminder of your own mortality this is the place to go!!!Loved the segregation...important people, children, doctors, virgins, yip they are all here!",
          "Place in Palermo You must visit. Hundrets of corpses / skeletons makes You feel strange and thrilled. Especially mumies of children and infants. Some of them so well preserved... We were seriously moved after the visit. Don't miss it!",
          "A must see if you are visiting Palermo, not for everyone though...very interesting and something you won't see often.",
          "This was a strange place but awesome ! 8000 dressed up corpses but not scary . \u20ac3 to get in......closed between 1pm and 3pm Go, it's worth it",
          "Well what can one say but simply the most creepy but interesting place we have ever visited. As ex-Archaeologists and a CSI this unique collection of mummies transcends everything. From a monk of 1599 to a two year old child. These mummies have eyes, hair and amazing preserved",
          "Morbid. Amazing to see the catacombs, it's worth a visit just for the novel experience. Very morbid though, some of the corpses still have intact faces. The main 'attraction' is the intact body of a dead baby. Pretty creepy. Historically the bodies range from the late 16th",
          "Very particular location, with hundreds of skeletons and mummified bodies. The \"sleeping girl\" is quite particular",
          "Super interesting and shocking . First of all, it's at least a 15-30 minute walk from the city center through not such a nice area. However , the place itself is well worth a visit, to see something completely different from what we are used to. I was quite disturbed after, but",
          "As you walk into the catacombes you are immediately come face to face with hundreds of mummified corpses. In some of them you can make out the facial features whereas on some there is quite a bit of decay. One section is full of small children and babies which I found quite",
          "We took the tour bus in Palermo and you get off at no 7 stop I think and it is about a 15 min walk, it does close at lunchtime so just be careful and check the opening times before you go it costs 3 euro each to get in. Interesting to see, worth visiting.",
          "If you like the macabre it is well worth the visit but if you are a sensitive person don't go. It is a huge \"collection\" of the dead lining the corridors mostly dressed in their Sunday finery. The last resident Rosalia looks like a doll. Very weird, difficult to compare to",
          "I've been to catacombs before but this was a real wow. It's worth the visit just to see the unusual way they hung the dead, and the beautiful little girl. We had a guide so it added tremendously to what we were viewing.",
          "We loved it here! take a taxi as it's about an hours walk out of the town centre, it's a fascinating experience and reasonable to get in! Well worth a visit",
          "... very strong impact and way how to meet with another attitude to death... Good to visit on the way to cathedral... Then to relax on the cathedral roof..",
          "Definitely worth the 3 EUR entrance fee, but it would have been nice with some more information down in the catacombes. You had to pay 4 EUR for the guidebook, which didn't really seem worth it. Still, I'd recommend going there, it was interesting even without the additional",
          "The short tour through the corpse filled Catacombs is an horrible experience, in a somewhat good way. This is certainly something that I will never forget. The entrance fee is reasonable but to get information you have to buy a small booklet of 4\u20ac. Certainly not for children,",
          "I dont understand why anybody should like it to be shown like that after death. The categories are strange, like presenting virgins and to show little kids bodies like that, is more than without any Moral. I am sorry i dont understand this kind of religion.",
          "This is such a contrast to any other tourist attraction you will visit anywhere else in the world. The catacombs are an amazing view into a tradition observed since the 1700s and as recently as the 1920s. The fact that the Monks have given people the opportunity to look into",
          "It is truely a unique experience but after the first few corpses includng the babies - well they are more or less the same. Not sure about how ethical it is to make money from those who have died. a bit of excitment wondering if some bits are going to break off and fall on",
          "I've never seen anything quite like this. Definitely worth a visit. Only 3\u20ac, won't take more than 15-20 minutes to browse, the cemetery and church were also nice. A bit outside of town, the walk from the north gate was 15 minutes of sweating, but worth it.",
          "Unfortunately we came to the Catacombs 5 min before they were closing, but we went down anyway and luckily the guy at the entrance let us stay for 10 min. It was a very different experience, and I don't know if it was because we were in such a hurry that we didn't see any info",
          "We went to the catacombs circa 14.00. Walking through it takes roughly 10-15 minutes. But what a great time. It was a slightly scary experience in which I contemplated the lives of the mummies (which have been there since from 100 years to over 400 years. It is not for people",
          "Interesting experience and quite shocking tbh but not much info on the general idea of the existance of the tombs. Just opened coffins and mummies everywhere :)",
          "Visiting the Catacombs was a really special experience. Several corridors filled with mummies and skeletons placed all over the walls. Most of them are wearing clothes, some of them have skin, hair and even facial expressions. There are different \"collections\" like Women, Men,",
          "Found this on a website of top things to do in Palermo so went along. Very interesting somber and different place to visit. Makes you think of your own mortality and not for everyone I would think and not for young children. One feels that you need to be reverend and quiet on a",
          "Well worth 3euro. Not my thing at all my Mrs made me go. Glad I did .Go on boys have some man the fxxk up",
          "This was one of the craziest absolutely most interesting places I've ever visited in all my travels. Dead bodies hanging on the wall, I mean skeletons, dressed up in their best outfits and in rows, divided by gender, age, and profession. Skulls lined up on the wall like jars of",

          "I have been to quite a few bone chapels in Europe, but this is truly a unique experience. Here you will see all levels of Palermatino citizenry, mummified, left as bones in their final state...to include the wardrobe. It is truly hard to describe. It may not be for everyone,",
          "Definetly a must see, however there was no information in english. Its in a weird neighbourhood we went there by car and paid for parking. You also pay for enterance like 3 euros.",
          "Incredible to visit, very confronting. Do not recommend for children at all. Avoid walking here as the road is very narrow and busy.",
          "This experience is creepy but interesting as you get taken back into a different time, when beliefs about death and burial were more diverse and give us perspective on life back then and the history of the city . One needs to read about this before you go however as there's",
          "A bit bizarre Place to og, but the curiosity caught up With us. Be aware of People that will watch Your car for Money if you park in the area. Its free parking so no need for that. We chose to move tha car further away, not possible to know what that People will do. Hence not a",
          "We visited the Catacombs taking turns as we were with a young kid who was sleeping when we got there. I don't know which adjectives I should use to describe this place..interesting, creepy, it gives a lot to think about... The ticket costs 3\u20ac and getting there requires a good",
          "I wasn't sure about this but knew that my other half wanted to see it. We visited in May. I thought it was really worth seeing and would recommend.",
          "The Capuchin Friars were very keen on death and keeping bodies of the dead on show. There is an egregious example in Rome but this is the larger example. Underground corridors and chambers are lined by real dead bodies, about eight thousand, dating from 17th to 19th Centuries.",
          "For horror-movies fans only. It's nothing more than a maze of corridors filled with skeletons: gave me the creeps, in addition it is in a remote location, and walking there is passing through sketchy streets...",
          "It was the first time in my life I have been in catacombs, and what I can say -It's really worth to visit, for sure if you are not afraid to see dead bodies. Maybe the most strange thing and uncommon is little balsamied girl under the glass, where she seems like a doll. You pay",
          "Definitely worth a visit simply for the fact that it's different from any other catacombs I've been to. It's not creepy or too dark and it's actually quite an interesting look into Sicilian culture. The road out to it from central Palermo is simple to find and follow but you'll",
          "A rather haunting experience, but I'd do it again. The entry is only \u20ac3 and the size of the collection is very impressive. Surely a thing to remember and reflect upon.",
          "This place is really impressive. When I planned my trip to Palermo, it was my primary place of interest. The entree fee is 3\u20ac, photo and video is prohibited but it worths visiting",
          "We visited here following a recommendation and while I'm glad we did visit the catacombs, it certainly was an experience. It's not the sort of place you could spend hours as it's incredibly eerie - particularly, the wonderfully-preserved child encased towards the end of the",
          "One of the most wierd bizarre but totally engrossing sights in the whole of Italy. Not for the faint hearted - but you will not forget this easily. A bit out of the way but well worth the journey.",
          "Thousands of bodies in various states of preservation--monks, priests, men, women, children--on shelves, in open coffins, hanging on hooks. Don't try to take pictures. They really mean it when they tell you not to.",
          "Many designs formed by using different bones of the human body. Monks from this order buried after death for fifteen years then dug up and bones used in display.",
          "This is quite unbelievable. You are literally looking at the remains of ancient people. Fascinating, a bit creepy, unique. Photos and videos are not allowed and there are cameras so if you disrespect the dead and try to photograph them \"Big Brother\" will ask you to stop over",
          "There is no photography allowed here so be sure to take it all in. This catacomb was located next to a church and a graveyard site. There were a few stairs that you had to go up and down in order to get to the catacombs. Our tour guide explained how and why these bodies",
          "This is an very very very strange attraction. I have never seen something like this. It's kind of weird ans unnerving. Just go and have look.",
          "This is a commercial undertaking: lots and lots of dead bodies but not authentic. Corpses more than 150 years dead with still some pretty good clothes on: as I said \"weird\". Nevertheless, if you have the time, go visit and be amazed. Think \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson and",
          "I have visited the Capuchin crypts in rome, but they are nothing compared to this! The history alone is so interesting and it's hard to imagine that all these corpses were once living human beings. It's somewhat macabre, but fascinating at the same time. The clothes worn by the",
          "This place is creepy but definitely worth to visit! You have to walk a bit to get there but its a good place to visit something you may have ever seen before. There is also a nice graveyard to have a little walk in shadow if its a hot day.",
          "This place is kinda creepy and if you're into that horror stuff you'll love it. Skeletons surround you and no picture taking allowed, but not too sure anyone would want to take photos of the skeletons.. You'll find the most beautiful mummy here, she looks like she is just",
          "My husband did not enjoy this at all. He could not see what anyone would want to see mummified corpses. It was a very unusual site to see so many mummified bodies in one place, all dressed in clothes that they had worn in life. After a while there are just too many... and it is",
          "It was quite interesting and the ticket is cheap. Only 3 Euros/person. The bodies are well preserved and presented upon different galleries, but with no explantion relying to how old they are or what their story is. This can be improved.",
          "A somewhat macabre experience viewing 8000 preserved bodies including a perfectly preserved 3-year old child. The bodies were all catalogued and gave an insight into 19th century dress.",
          "This is a must see! Over 8000 bodies! They found this cemetery when they were renovating the church above. There is one baby girl \"sleeping beauty\" that died at age 2 in 1920 and her body is perfectly preserved. This attraction might not be for everyone. I throughly enjoyed it",
          "Never imagined it would be as it was - nothing like anything I've ever seen before. I'm glad I did see it though.",
          "We went here as I wanted to see the 2 year old Rosalina Lombardo preserved by a doctor who died before telling anyone how he did it. Its sad to see the children laid out & odd how the people aspired to be buried here hung up like pieces of meat. Rosalina was beautiful with",
          "If the Capuchins chose to store the human remains of their followers by hanging them in a catacomb, up to them. But displaying them to the public centuries later: what on earth is the point? Visit the Palazzo Zisa instead if you're in that part of town - another great example of",
          "Quite macabre. But if you can stomach it, it is fascinating and a unique experience. A one of a kind experience and place",
          "Since this is my first catacombs I rate it very good. Easy to maneuver, only had a bad smell in one small corner. Agreed, not much info on most of the corpses, but interesting to see various stages of decay and dress, and to read the markers in the floor. 3 euro entrance fee",
          "this is an attraction that is not suitable for everyone. i found it both interesting and compelling, but my other half found it somewhat distressing. if you do not mind seeing bodies that have not been moved since they have been placed then you will cope",
          "It may sound weird or creepy to go see dead people, but these catacombs are unlike others. Some of the bodies are hung on display next to each other, others are lying down. If there's one mummy you should definitely see it's the one of the little girl. She is so well preserved",
          "We had read the reviews and decided to go to this attraction. This is a good example of how society deals with death. Remains are located in different streets (men, women, professionals, children, clergy). Go in there with a sense of respect. This is not a peep show. No",
          "Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. This was not a burial place for just the monks, but for townspeople as well, especially the rich! Our guide explained the mummification process as well as the sentiment of the people back in the mid 1800s. I found it",
          "Definitely took turns with husband to have the 5 year old wait outside. The bodies inside are definitely what the nightmares of children are made of, but with that said it was very cool. The monk at the door was very nice. It only takes 10 minutes to see it all, but is amazing",
          "Very unique experience. Worth the trip. We have been all over the world and nothing like it. Straight out of a horror flick.",
          "Having missed the catacombs in Rome we managed to visit our first catacombs in Palermo. Very interesting seeing the way people had been remembered & the stages of decay following full or partial embalmment. And moving too, seeing the skeletons of little children and youths. A",
          "If you like a little \"horror\", visit this catacombs dating back only two centuries. Very strange way of burrying. Unique. One can ask questions about certain \"mummies\". Fakes ?",
          "We only went into a small part of the catacombs as my daughter and I both felt rather uncomfortable. Being surrounded by hundreds of dead people is not exactly entertainment.",
          "This was fascinating and worth a visit, but surprised that some people took their kids. Looking at the kids they were terrified as you could imagine with all the dead bodies hung on the walls.",
          "Not at all what we expected but interesting in a macabre way. I'm not sure the people interred there would have agreed had they known that 100 or so years later their coffins would be opened and their remains hung up for paying tourists to gawp at. Bizarre place !",
          "It was interesting but I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see this unless they are really fascinated by this type of attraction. The place can be stuffy and claustrophobic but luckily our visit was at an off-peak time with just a handful of people there so I",
          "Had heard about the Catacombs before visiting Palermo, so really wanted to see it but not sure what it would be like. Was a bit hard to find on foot. Well lit interior and good path once inside. Its a fascinating if rather creepy experience but would recommend it if you are",
          "We were travelling with my boyfriend with a group and our guide was not a fan of this-he was not even recommending it. So wrong! You shall definitely pay a visit when you are at Palermo and do include this on your main schedule. A bit creepy due to the fact that all skeletons",
          "It's eery but very interesting . You can see human bodies in different states of decay, some still with human hair intact. Read up before or later on the story of the young girl who died of pneumonia but is still well preserved",
          "I was intrigued by another traveler when I heard of the Catacombs and just had to go! It was definitely creepy and very interesting all at the same time. I'm glad I went, but have no need to go again!",
          "there are a bunch of dead people and nothing else. the corridors are suffocating and they lack story telling abilities. i would not recommend to spend your 3 euro admission fee here.",
          "A very strange visit. Never to be forgotten. Catacombs filled with hundreds of dead monk's and people , still in their upright position. Make sure you add it to your itinerary.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Catacombs. It was weird but really interesting. I was visiting as a day trip from a cruise ship stop off. There are lots of people offering excursions etc at the port where the ship docks. I asked specifically for a taxi to take me to the catacombs. The",
          "I went to the catacombs with my wife and her sister. It takes around 40 minutes to see everything, which means walking along the thematically arranged alleys - men, women, babies, virgins, monks etc. I had mixed feelings about the place. On one hand, it is a unique - and rather",
          "Weirdest place ever. Literally dead bodies pinned to the walls. Not for people who are claustrophobic. No smell of anything but you could feel a bit overwhelmed by the dead",
          "I had read about the catacombs prior to visiting and was keen to see them for myself. My partner and I visited on a Sunday around 3pm and it was busy but not overly so. The atmosphere is enjoyably creepy and the bodies are very well preserved! A guide book is available in",
          "We went to the catacombs whilst on a weekend break in Palermo because we had seen it on a TV programme. We walked there from the town centre. I am glad we visited as the place is interesting, if macabre. It is probably not every one's idea of an \"attraction\" so be prepared to",
          "I like anything creepy and weird and this was most certainly that. It's a bit out of the way and you only need about 20-30 minutes to wander through but it's unlike any catacombs I've ever seen because the bodies are so well preserved. I'll leave it at that. You'll have to see",
          "We visited the catacombs as part of an optional day trip whilst cruising with Norwegian Epic. It was morbid, and unless you like seeing hundreds of dead, musty, decayed bodies up close then I would steer clear of this place. It was interesting for about 5 minutes but the tour",
          "We drove for 30 min trying to find the place but didn't worry because trip adviser said they were open till midnight. We got there and they closed at 7:00.",
          "The catacombes are quite far from the city center so you may consider this if you want to walk in summer. The price is 3 euros and you are NOT allowed to take pictures, so I wonder how these images got into Tripadvisor:))) It s weird and not for sensitive souls but also not",
          "Very interesting and oddly peaceful. Originally Capuchin monks were \"buried\" here but then it apparently became a symbol of status for the family. We didn't go with a tour and I think it is a better experience without the noise of a large group. You can always read about it",
          "We went here due to the good reviews and the fact it was something out of the ordinary. Honestly I didn't like it at all; I felt very uncomfortable during the visit and only stayed a few minutes. A lot of the 'bodies' still have skin and hair intact and are fully clothed and",
          "I was just a kid when I went to the catacombs for the first time ... that night I didn't sleep. It seemed to have seen a horror film. However, today, forty years later, I suggest all tourists to see this charming place. You will see thousands of dead bodies, a few centimeters",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and would recommend this venue wholeheartedly. I thought it might be a bit macabre but found it relaxing. We walked from the city centre and only took half an hour.",
          "Oh my god, one of the most scary and unique places I have ever been... definitely worth a visit, trust me you won't forget this!",
          "We didn't know what to expect. It was interesting. Off cappuccini road. There's corpses of babies , men and women. Either laying or hanging.",
          "The catacombs are filled with mummified bodies and skeletons of former residents of Palermo who died between the 17th and 19th centuries. For a modest entrance fee you descend steps into the underground tomb. It's a very strange sight seeing bodies still dressed in decayed",
          "I had never visited catacombs before but this was certainly an eye opener. A short tour to a location that is tucked away a good walk from the city centre. Well worth the visit especially if combined with looking at the next door cemetary",
          "Yes, it is weird looking at hundreds of mummified bodies. But, it is also very interesting. To think of why this was done and how. The bodies are in different stages of decay; some just bone and some with skin and hair. There are men, women, and children. It was difficult for me",
          "Very interesting but sacred repository of the deceased. Some most incredibly preserved by the atmosphere of the crypt; even dressed in original clothing. However left the place not entirely sure as to the purpose of the display and whether it was a customary place of worship of",
          "This catacomb is probably one of the I've ever seen. Displays of probably hundreds of bodies are neatly shown in vertical positions, horizontal as well, and many are still dressed to their finest. The expressions on their faces are all so different. Sections on family",
          "Amazing trip! Our guide Ricardo had a wealth of knowledge and is very passionate historian. Could have asked for a better guide.",
          "I planned this as my first stop on a Saturday morning, so arrived just prior to opening time at 9 AM. Only a few other visitors at that time, which was good. The catacombs themselves were a surprise, with skeletons still wrapped in their burial outfits hanging from hooks on the",
          "Well... this is pretty much what it says an underground tomb. The bodies are hanging from the walls and laying in stacked tombs. The decomposition varies and some still have hair and skin . It includes infants and children. Not for the faint hearted. There are no information",
          "Our guide took us to this place. We did not know what to expect. We all found it rather gruesome, being confronted with hundreds of mummified bodies. Some of these were hanging up while others were on shelves built in to the walls. I must say this is not for the faint hearted,",
          "This is quite amazing, however be warned you are confronted by death on all sides as you journey into the Catacombs, and walk amongst those who completed their lifes journeys centuries ago. In 1599 the Capuchinian monks (the drink Cappucino reminded the constructors of this",
          "The catacombs of the Capuchines, located just outside the city centre, are one of the most peculiar places to visit in Palermo. The mummies (rather skeletons), dressed in their contemporary costumes, make them look like a horror scene. At the same time, it is like a trip back",
          "Very macabre, one time visit only and Good value for money @ 3\u20ac each. Very interesting and thought provoking \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f Only downside of a local vagrant trying to charge for parking, and no need to do so.",
          "Easy to find. The man at the entrance is friendly and speaks english just enough. This place is really interesting, maybe a bit creepy for some at the beginning, but I'm sure anyone can easily get used to it. It's not too far from the center, I think it's worth giving it a try.",
          "We arrived at the catacombs at opening time (9 AM) and were the first in the door. The ticket seller was pleasant. The attraction was one of the places that my wife really wanted to see in Palermo. No pictures allowed inside but reasonable souvenirs at the entrance. Not for",
          "Well worth a visit here, entrance is cheap, and a visit will typically last 30 minutes. There is no smell - for those that may be concerned about this, and is not in the slightest bit scary or gory. There are in fact some very well preserved bodies, including one of a little",
          "We went there because we saw it on the internet. First outside you have the typical gipsy asking for money to let you park in a free zone. Then the ticket is 3\u20ac and they are not kind.",
          "This place is unlike any other on the planet. We had three teenagers in our group and they loved it. We all agreed it was the highlight of our two weeks in southern Italy and cannot be missed.",
          "First must say if you are a little aprensive dont even try to enter. Its literaly death dryed people exposed. Its part of the local history and one of those creepy places that dont have sense in nowa days. After all, one thing that cannot be seen anywhere else.",
          "Took a cab from a few blocks from the cruise terminal, wanted to wander a little. Catacombs were shocking and sad and very interesting. Highly recommend.",
          "The catacombs were so amazing, not morbid at all. It was incredible to be so close to the bodies and realize that this was a means of preserving (embalming) these bodies. The youngest little girl, Rosalia was somewhat sad due to her age of two. We had a tour guide who explained",
          "At the request of my daughter who already knew of the Catacombe in Palermo , we accompanied her in Dec 2016. I was not very comfortable inside. The place is in a large basement of an ancient building. Areas are sectioned off into different centuries of death and different",
          "Always wanted to see it since watching an episode about it on NG. It exceeded my expectations. It is what it is, nothing more nothing less. A must see if you are into an unusual things or rare things for that matter. I had young children with me too, and with prior explanation",
          "I've been to many catacombs before and this is one of my favourites! The entrance is inexpensive, pictures are not allowed and it's a 15\u20ac ride from the centre of the city.",
          "If you're into this kind of attractions, this is a great place for you. Medium sized catacombs with a lot of interestingly morbid skeletons and mummies, and the famously well preserved body of Rosalia Lombardo, which is said to sometimes blink. It is totally worth the visit, and",
          "This place is quite special. Rows and rows of bodies very differently preserved. Some were mummified, others just dried up. At the beginning I was surprised as how close you can be to these bodies, you could touch them, hug them if you wished :) You can try guessing who these",
          "It is the one of most impressive places to visit. This collection of mummified bodies does not seem very strange or fearful. I was touched to see a small girl of two years to be embalmed.",
          "just be prepared before it, for myself i was alone in the big alley and really it was very strange as some of the body looks like they are still alive!",
          "It will be kinda eerie if you visit the catacomb alone. do go with a friend or in a group. It is old but very interesting and eerie. I kinda enjoy the visit. Its not your usual tourist attraction. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "If your expectations are to be either thrilled by the ambience or spiritually lifted by the presence of death, forget it. You will find rows upon rows of skeletons amassed like old rifles in an old mothballed army armoury.",
          "strange collection of mummified bodies could be a bit disconcerting for some but we enjoyed it never seen as many bodies together before NB all ages",
          "This is definitely worth a visit to experience something completely different. We weren't sure what we would be seeing but it was so interesting to see the preservation of these old souls.",
          "A slightly disturbing and emotional place to visit, but worth experiencing. I wasn't sure what to expect, and was certainly taken aback to begin with.",
          "I has visited catacombs in a number of locations in Italy including Rome and Siracusa, but Palermo's display was just too much. The endless display of dead bodies hanging from the wall, including children was quite graphic. I understand the point of it being considered",
          "This is unusual but worth seeing. It depicts methods of body preservation. A 2-year-old child is preservedwho looks like she died yesterday. It is not for the faint of heart. Unlike other catacombs, here you see actual bodies. It really is an interesting place. Father A.",
          "Interesting place to visit to see Palermo's mummified dead. Some are as old as 500 years old. See also the most \"beautiful mummy\" (a 2 year old girl). Cost is 3\u20ac and there is a small gift shop where you get tickets. Be aware that photos are not allowed. Also, check hours",
          "I do not understand why people consider this place as \"fascinating\". it is full of mummified cadavers hanging by the neck from the walls in what appears to be a basement of Capuchin's convent. Yes that was the tradition of these times not to bury people (I assume), but if you",
          "We visited the Catacombs a morning during our stay to Palermo.The visit was lasted about an hour.Cheap ticket.It reminds you that life is short.Best part of it the little girl which it seems to sleep.",
          "A macabre, fascinating and at times rather sad insight into another world, bygone times and lives lived and lost/taken, sometimes far too soon. The catacombs house around 2,000 skeletons and mummified bodies, making it the largest and the most extraordinary collection of mummies",
          "Catacombs are quite easy to find, entrance is right of Capuchins cemetery in the corner. I gave only 4 stars because, there should be more extensive description of some mummies. Never the less, quite an experience....",
          "These so called \"catacombs\" are made of several corridors with dead people hanging on walls. Skeletons or mummied dressed and hanged on the walls, less than 1 meter from you. Somehow it didn't feel right.",
          "We walked from the center of town to the Catacombs. It was a bit of a walk but certainly doable and safe. We had been to the Capuchin Church in Rome and thought this would be an interesting comparison. I am =not sure what I expected but this is beyond words. I was amazed by",
          "If you are not from southern Italy, you havn't seen anything like this before. Don't come here to take pictures though: it would be considered as a lack of respect.",
          "It was a surreal experience. Walking along the corridors watching all these people who were just like me, but beyond the realm of life. A very humbling and meaningful experience. This place is very powerful.",
          "Having seen the Catacombs in Rome years ago, so I went on a whim, did not do any research before visiting. The Catacombs of the Capuchins are different. Skeletons are displayed hanging on the walls, lying in coffins..... Did not dare to look at the faces, only viewing the",
          "I walked to the catacombs, through the bustling noise, heat and stink of Palermo. The route is signposted, but you will also have to use your instincts to find the exact location, which isn't obvious if you just follow the signs. You enter via a ticket office banked with",
          "The bodies in these catacombs are mummified and clothed. There are adults and babies. Some might say you have to be a ghoul to be interested in this place, but we found it compelling. Some of the corpses are hundreds of years old, one or two in fact are dressed in Napoleonic",
          "Not necessarily a \"must see,\" but an experience. I have know about them for decades but just went to visit.",
          "I visited the catacombs because my friends wanted to see them. There is a small entrance fee. It was interesting to see how the corpses were categorized, for instance, professionals, virgins, etc. I don't think I'd want to go back again. It is worth seeing once.",
          "These mummies are not well preserved. The mummification process used here left a lot to be desired. The effect will be different for each visitor. I was scared to go in, but ended up laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle. Personally I find it disrespectful of the dead to",
          "This is not like any other catacombes I've ever seen or heard of ,8000 bodies,most hanging on walls in niches fully clothed, in various stages of decomposition (one small child from the 1920 looks as if just sleeping others look like uncle fester in the Adams family.earliest I",
          "You've just got to see this and reflect how it makes you feel, amazing! The whole visit is just amazing, not sure it's a family visit though",
          "The only time we've seen people who have been preserved! What a crazy idea and tradition. A must see if you are in the area!",
          "Won't see stuff like this back in the States. Yes, creepy, but the history of why and what is something to see. The monks did a great job in preserving history of the past. Do not take pictures...they will he'll at you if caught lol.",
          "Worth the visit if you want to see what happens to the human body after death. Interesting tour under the ground in semi dark around 100's years old bodies.",
          "Worth seeing but it's creepy afterwards some of the mummies are scarry as... kids especially but no regrets thing to see definitely",
          "Thousands of skeletons and mummified bodies staring at you as they hang on the walls. Eerie, creepy and strangely fascinating all at the same time. The guide was knowledgeable but spoke softly and I had to jockey toward the front to hear. Been there once - that's enough.",
          "We have visited catacombs before but nothing like this! Literally hundreds of mummified bodies out for all to see. It's very confronting when you first enter and see the first long corridor of bodies in various stages of preservation and decay. If you are lucky enough to be",

          "We visited the catacombs because it was something different. If you are freaked out by death or mummies, this is not a destination to visit for you. However, if you are wanting to see some interesting history, this is definitely unique. We had a tour guide, so we were",
          "Whilst in Palermo this is a must see. Very strange experience looking a dead people. Okay during the day but wouldn't like to be locked in at night!\ud83d\ude04 Only thing that annoyed me was the amount of people disrespecting the notices everywhere not to take photos!",
          "I like catacombs and their mystery atmosfere... but Catacombs of the Capuchins are just exhibition of dead bodies with no respect to them. After my visit I felt uneasy and unsettled.",
          "This is a must visit when in Palermo. Forget the high priced tours ... Entrance is only 3 Euro... and the Catacombs are accessible by a leisurely walk or taxi. Historically... fantastic... just remember... it is a crypt",
          "Don't prepare beforehand, just visit, then read about it afterwards... and if you have time, the cemetery next door is worth a look, including Giuseppe Tomasa di Lampadusa's grave (ask for help, it's not easy to find).",
          "Not at all what I expected from catacombs. Dead bodies/ skeletons hanging from the walls, warehouse feeling. I know there is a religious aspect there and this is how it was done in the 18th/ 19th century. However, taking money and admitting groups of people without possibly the",
          "If you don't like dead people do not go here! It's a strange place but in its way beautiful. All those corpses hanging there for so many years some for 100 years. I'm glad I've visited this place! It left an impression!",
          "This was our first visit to a Catacomb. We have heard of catacombs in Rome and other places (including in Paris) but have never visited one. This was an interesting experience, but it is not for everyone.",
          "A rather unexpected group of hanging skeletons with clothes and sometimes hair. Mainly holy people and those of high rank. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "The catacombs are int he basement level of the Monasterio dei Capuccini in Palermo, and it consists of corridors covered with mumificated dead bodies. Some of them unbelievingly well preserved... so much that it can give you creeps! All in all, it is one of the miracles and",
          "This place will not be to everyone's taste,facinating , interesting,even creepy, to be allowed to see these bodies displayed for all to see may seem wrong ,but obviously to the monks and the local people who were allowed to be interned here was a final honour.for me and my wife",
          "Not easy to find, so check before going. Closed during middle of the day and reopens 3pm. Cost is reasonable at 3 euros. Hundreds of corpses line niches in the walls of these catacombs, some are embalmed some just skeletons. Many are still clothed. Utterly weird and a bit",
          "I read about this is one of the most scary museum in the world. And it was so indeed.you should see here if you visit Palermo. Bodies were like as if they had just died. Their skin, hair and clothes were still intact.",

          "I didn't know what to expect going down those stairs to the underground room full of catacombs. But it was definitely not what I felt : I had a mixture of emotions that made me feel humble and pushed me to appreciate life and what has been given to us to use it for the good of",
          "I doubt that you will ever see anything like this again. A visit to the Catacombs is unique and fascinating. However maybe not for the faint hearted, but certainly a must do while you are in Palermo",

          "I went there with my sister and spent over an hour there just analyzing everything. So many details, so many stories untold. We wished we had background stories of some of them, because we were so curious. It's amazing, will definitely come back one day!",
          "A fascinating insight into the lives (and death) of Sicilians in 1850's. The main attraction is the well persevered remains of Rosalie Lombardo but just seeing the clothing and the coffins give an amazing insight into this history. Great and unique experience.",
          "A seriously weird experience. Dozens of skeletal remains line the walls of this catacomb, decked out in their Sunday best, staring down at the gawping visitors. Some have their mouths hanging open, some have heads caved in. You walk down rows arranged by designation - men,",
          "Possibly the strangest, most macbre tourist attraction we've ever heard of, nevermind visited. still talking about it nearly a week after we've been, considering we've also seen an opera, been up a volcano and visited ustica that's saying something. Definitely pay the 3\u20ac to",

          "Not an atraction that will be to everones tastes - as a doctor I am not phased by death - but the presentation of death here might be shocking to some. Historical - Yes Cultural - Certainly Worth a visit - In my opinion yes definately",
          "The tradition of mummification was long present in Sicily. However those mummies were mostly skeletons. It is a bit morbide, out of town and I would not go again (yes they have the most beautiful mummy in the world).",

          "I went here to see my relatives and the little girl they said had died in 1925 where they preserved her body. She did not look as good as she did for all those years. For some reason they opened up her casket I guess to look and find out how she was preserved, and for some",
          "I didn't quite know what to expect, but this was a bit more disturbing than i thought it would be. People that like this stuff will love it!",
          "Lots and lots of dressed up skeletal remains from the mid-19th century. My favorites were the Admirals and Priests. Very sad to see the babies and young kids. Disappointed that they don't allow photos, but do I really want a selfie with a corpse?",
          "This place is totally bizarre. I visited with my girlfriend who struggles to stay interested in museums/ galleries and the like. The walls of the catacombs are completely filled with preserved dead bodies. It's quite eerie and creepy to walk around but also very very",
          "This is the place to go to appreciate the reasons why a culture would do something like this. Don't think about the morbitity of it, just go for the historical and religious aspects and the history. My cousin, who is in his 80s tells me when he was a kid...as they lived nearby,",
          "Rows and rows of bodies lie in these Catacombs. Interesting thing to visit - very unique experience. Far removed from our hotel, so hotel ride was a necessity. Very expensive to get there - but very reasonable to visit.",
          "We visited the Catacombs on a Sunday - having read so many reviews about NOT driving around Palermo during the week! It was easy to find on SatNav and we parked without a problem. Quite a friendly man behind the desk with a little English, didn't try to sell me anything I didn't",
          "Exclusive experience, weird feeling, very impressive. A bit far from the center by feet but it's worth it. No picture allowed",
          "Thousands of bodies are hanging on the walls, dressed in their dust covered 1600s finery, and some still even have skin. It's fascinating, and worth a trip to Palermo just to see it. Free parking is right in the plaza outside the building, but give the amiable keeper of the cars",
          "We walked to the catacombs which is a bit of a walk from central station. But you can walk via a variety of other tourist atractions so that worked out fine. There is a \u20ac3 entree fee and photo's and film are not allowed. Some people did take pictures whoch was very",
          "Went here after seeing the advertising. Parking is difficult right outside and there are parking touts trying to get you to leave your car with them. Just go around the corner and there are plenty of free spaces to park. It costs \u20ac3.00 to go in which is not dear. As you walk",
          "We visited last year as part of a Thomson tour and found the experience shocking. One couple left immediately, visibly upset and commenting they didn't need to see this. If you have suffered a traumatic experience make sure you are fully aware. I hadn't fully appreciated what",
          "We went on a Sunday and it was open in case anyone wonders about hours. We didn't look up much history about the place but it was still interesting to see. I suggest understanding it a bit more.. it will probably be more fun to you if you do.",
          "In one word- amazing! I have visited Paris catacombs which are really impressive in size and atmosphere but here things are even more creepy- bodies with clothes ranged by their gender, position in the society. For those who can not watch horror movies I do not recommend. But",
          "Yes you are about to walk down corridors full of skeletons, many still wearing the clothes of the time they died in. Some still have hair and dried skin. After the initial shock of being surrounded by so many creepy faces leaning out towards you as you walk past you do begin to",
          "Don't miss these catacombs which include the rooms where the bodies are slowly drained and then hung up to dry! It is a bit hard to find with winding streets, but well worth the effort!",
          "Very interesting but had an awful nights sleep. The presentation is done very well and because we had a private guide was informative.",
          "This was on our list of places we really wanted to go. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I just found it very very weird and felt like a voyeur. Some of the skeletons are in a bad state, heads dropping off etc but I guess you would be too if you were 300 years old! The",
          "hidden off the beaten tourist track, this is an unusual site. I wasn't sure how Id feel wandering around several hundred mummified remains. It's eerie and peaceful at the same time. Worth visiting.",
          "Its not the \"politically correct\" site for manistream tourism. I found it very interesting though. Even the word catacombes brings to mind something very subterranean this site is def not. Its a big basement with \"storing\" any kind of human skull. Its like a huge art",
          "This was an interesting if very somber experience. It's interesting to see how different the monks attitude was to death as well as other people that followed their example of having the bodies of their loved ones embalmed so they could be visiting and seen any time. Thought",
          "If you're a little bit curious, morbid, and sick--as I consider myself--you'll probably get a kick out of this place. Fans of Europe's Weirdest Dead People Exhibits like the crypts in Rome, Sedlec(CR), etc. will enjoy the preserved fashions of bygone eras, and strange, often",
          "This crypt is extremely interesting. It contains large amounts of corpses and skeletons dressed in the clothing they were buried in. Women, Men and Children there doesn't appear to be a rhyme or reason on how they are displayed.",
          "While it does show you what it promises: dried out bodies in catacombs, it doesn't have the atmosphere I associated it with. Its clean and well lit passageways take you past many skeletons and mummies, some with original clothing. Occasionally an individual body is highlighted",
          "We were not disappointed. It would be best to do a bit of research before hand to help with the visit. Palermo is a bit of a gritty city and this place for that bill.",
          "I've been there just once, but I promise never visit it once again. There are hundreds of mummificated bodies and skeletons. The air stinks of death. Please, do not take there children or people of not strong spirit.",
          "This was disappointing for our group of five. The man at the ticket booth was charming while he was trying to sell us a book about the place but when we chose not to buy the book his attitude changed and he became quite rude and off-handed. I feel that it would not be",
          "Gazing into the faces of mummified corpses in various states of arrested decomposition is not for everyone. But, for me, once the initial discomfort passed there emerged a sense of serenity and, even, beauty. Some of the people here died young. Some violently. Some at end of",

          "A significant walk from the town centre, but well worth it. Over 8000 bodies, dating back to the early 18th century. Some were very well preserved and their clothes were intact. Amazing to spend time imagining who they were in life. Other visitors were loud, shouting and",
          "I expected better preserved bodies. Rooms without air conditioning, wet. Only bones and clothes are preserved. I thought it would be more impressive.",
          "A little unique place . Must be seen . A little difficult for kids may be ... But for a unique experience and make you realize you are not here for ever",
          "Unique place int Palermo, with thousands and thousands mummies from different centurys. Historical and respectful display of a long death. Must see it.",
          "Don't skip that. It's a bit of scary actually and we weren't capable to spent much time inside the catacombs, but it has that \"something completelly different\" appeal.",
          "A unique experience for the hard of stomach! I would advise hiring a guide to understand the history of the catacombs. Inconveniently there are no waiting facilities during its lunch closure.",
          "Row after row of skeletons most dressed in their finest attire, family groupings, professional associations, church hierarchy, creepy and interesting",
          "The catacombs are in great shape. they are really nicely curated. The bodies are quite explicit so be warned, you might get nightmares after this visit.",
          "Is a must see objective if you visit Palermo just because is a unique kind of monument. Like a common mortuary mausoleum that describes the tradition of the ancient times. Not suitable for kids. Creepy and could give nightmares if you a heart suffering.",
          "Interesting place to visit - creepy but fascinating to see! Doesn't take that long to go around the entire exhibition maybe 30minutes at most. Not a far walk from the Palazzo Reale.",
          "Creepy but intriguing. Well worth visiting. Slightly out of town. We took 20 mins to walk there. There are buses.",
          "Mixed feelings about this... husband and son really seemed to like it but I found it a bit odd in that all these skeletons were on display. I wonder how people would have felt if they knew this is what would happen to them hundreds of years or so after they have paid to be",
          "I did not enjoy this place at all,my husband and daughter found it morbidly fascinating. It is a cellar with hundreds of upright and clothed skeletons. Weird and not for everyone.",

          "A very respectful display of the long dead. I see in the reviews that people say it isn't for children, but it is not scary at all. The displays are informative and offer a sanitised glimpse into the local dead people of the time. One gets a feel of the love and care that",
          "It feels surreal walking past and looking at hundreds, if not thousands, of dead persons standing up or lying in open caskets. And the two year old child can give everyone nightmares...",

          "This place is mesmerising, very much worth visiting. Watching all those who left this world but their flesh still with us is a bit disturbing but  on the other hand forcing you to stop ans think about your life. It won't take you much time, \u2026",
          "Is creepy and fascinating I never had been a place like that before. Worthy a visit",

It's much tidier than some of the photos suggest as coffins boxes removed from the walkways and metal grills put up to protect the bodies. Apparently this was to stop people touching and taking bits of body. Fascinating really.",

          "Once in a lifetime , never seen any thing like it.",

          "Creepy place to visit, but I think it is a must see in Palermo if you are into history and cultural heritage. You are not allowed to take pictures inside. It is a pity we did not have a guide that could speak to you about what happened there. But we did some research on Google on our own while inside.",

          "Historical and mysterious place. Very interesting. Read its history before going.",
          "I do not recommend it. Is one of a kind, but it is creepy.  Hundreds of death bodies exposed on the walls. The tickets is cheap, but is should not allowed to enter kids. \nIf you are a morbid person is a place for you. But for me, even out of curiosity it was way too much.",

          "Dead should not be exposed like that for other people's amusement. They should rest at peace.",

          "Very interesting catacombs, it hosts many ex humans in various states. It has a somewhat macabre flair to it but it's history and style are unique. Would definitely recommend, if possible take a guide with you to tell you the details and it's history.",

Optically interesting place with a lot of corpses in various stages of deceising.\nIt would be cool if they provided some context information about how they ended up there and when and why.\nSo maie sure to read up about this on Wikipedia or something before visiting.",

          "Definitely not for the faint of heart. Over 8,000 skeletons and lots of history.",

          "It's worth visiting as you can see how people were buried (or rather preserved) over time. Your entrance fee helps Cappuccinis. Only problem, it is quite outside from city centre so you'd better look for buses. If you have to walk there by \u2026",
          "Weird but cool.  No photos allowed inside, so here\u2019s one from out the front.  Family of 5 verdict: cool, hated it, weirdest place I\u2019ve been, awesome, I have no comment. Must see.",

          "Have never ever seen something like that before. Worth the money and a look.",
          "Worth to see if you're in Palermo. Some of those bodys didnt even decay. Price for entrance is reasonable.",
          "Interesting. Good to know- it's not allowed to make pictures. But go there only if you really like creepy things. For me was heartbreaking to see little babies dead bodies.",
          "A solemn place and you can get creeped out by the skeletons , but worthwhile visiting to see how some people\u2019s remains were treated.",
          "This stands way out from any other sight in Palermo and also describes people's mentality very well.",
          "It's something special and unique.",
          "It\u2019s an interesting place to visit. A little out of the way from the center of the city but still walkable. It\u2019s a weirdly fascinating place to visit. The big downside is the lack of context. There\u2019s nothing to help you understand why are these people there, what started this and who are these people.",
          "I loved the experience, my wife not entirely as she felt the place is creapy. I have learned and experience something new, worth it",
          "Mixed experience. Interesting but only that. It was nice to have some info written on at least some of the corpses. If you are in Palermo and you are not affraid of skelettons, you should go pay a visit. 3eur entrance fee. The only place where i didn't receive an actual ticket or receipt for the entrance money i paid.",
          "Interesting place to see specific mummy. It's 3 euro",
          "Visiting these catacombs gives a dual feeling. I think I will remeber this forever although dead people are near and touchable close. Skeletons of died PEOPLE and even children are hanging on the walls while dozens of tourists are walking true these alleys with thousands of death people. Creepy, almost unreal. Mixed feelings here....",
          "Not an everyone's dream to see but if you feel an interest in mummies it is a good experience to see how they kept till today.",
          "A most macabre, but the most fascinating place you're ever likely to experience. There are no barriers between the living and the dead down here in these ancient catacombs, so it's not a place for the squeamish or the faint hearted. Not suitable for children and please remember to be reverent and respectful, this is not a sideshow.",
          "The place is interesting but it would be much better if you can find some more information about the people buried there. Signs with dates and some histories in different languages would be very helpful, otherwise you feel like if were staring at some dead bodies and that's all. \nBe aware that the place is closed from 1pm to 3pm!",
          "A bit grisly/morbid for my taste. But if you like looking at corpses then I reckon it's be a five star.",

          "Creepy but unique indeed.",
          "The best experience I had in Palermo. It's really unique and life changing",
          "Well, like most of the reviews here, 'interesting if you like that sort of thing', or haven't seen catacombs before.  Not a visit that needs repeating, really.\nAmazing how any part of the human flesh is still there after hundreds of \u2026",
          "Less unsettling than the gigantic marionets that are part of the Sicilian cultural traditions.\nOnce in a lifetime experience.",
          "Interesting not a lot in English",
          "I really did not like this. Simply macabre. These folk wanted to be put on display after they had died. Monks- cardinals- children- soldiers- virgins??- Not quite sure I got my head round the not so gentle decay. It did not smell but it just felt wrong.",
          "worth those 4eu to see something I have personally never did before. An interesting part is thatcsome of scelletons still have skin on it. You can't take pictures though.",
          "Well worth the journey and not too far to walk from the port. A tad on the creepy side, but what else do you expect at a catacomb?",
          "There was no explanation or placards explaining the history of the people or the place. The bodies tied and stuck up seemed disrespectful when I didn't know why they were there or who they were.",
          "This place is unlike anything you'll ever see. There's a book you should buy in the gift shop as photos are forbidden, and they'll shame you on a P. A. for about a minute straight before coming down to shame you some more.",
          "Impressive, amazing place....",
          "Worth a visit, for curiosity value.\nMake sure you buy their photo book though, as they ask you not to take photos inside the crypt.",
          "I remember when I was 10-15 years old I saw a documentary about this place. I am faint hearted but this place amazed me since that time. 10 years later (Mai 2016) I actually had the chance to visit this place. I have to be honest the place \u2026",
          "Make you think about your short life and how human body becomes after death. A good spiritual lesson",

          "Hard to rate this place if you like macqarb places this is for you its strange a bit upsetting i dud not look at the little girl in glass coffin my son did and said he could not believe it looked like she was sleeping but its an experience",
          "Astonishing, puts a few different thoughts in your head, definitely worth visiting",
          "Interesting place to see. I recommend to see it. In 2018, a ticket costs 3\u20ac. But I'm not sure if it's good to bring children too !",
          "This is a really grim place, with all those dead people staring on you. It is located in the basement, so the air here is a little heavy. \nTicket costs 3 euro. It is located apart from the other points of interest. The photos is not allowed here, but I couldn\u2019t resist and took one.",
          "Cool place. Worth a visit.  A little more information in a second language (french, german, english) would be a good idea.",
          "Creepy but interesting",
          "Interesting but can't photograph.",
          "A very intriguing place which houses the remains of hundreds of people who once inhabited the streets of Palermo. The bodies, dating from the period between 1599 and roughly 1880 give you a good idea about the fashion of those days. \u2026",
          "A beautiful place to visit on Valentine's Day with your loved one.",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "hmm took my family here from Missisipi, took little Davidson who is my son and cousin, he loved it even took some souvenirs from the bodies. My wife and sister Mary-ann was crying cause back in Missisipi the bodies only come from the sewers. I loved i like the smell of raw meat tasty.",
          "Pretty unique collection of dead folks.",
          "A memorable experience. Some bodies are almost too lifelike, like the blonde boy. If you can't handle the sight of dead people avoid this, as it might be a bit stressful. But for the morbidly curious. This is a very interesting experience. \u2026",
          "A monk on the entrance took us \u20ac1 extra for unknown reasons",
          "Freaky and disturbing, not for the faint hearted..",
          "Unique but not necessarily a good tourist place. Being there, I felt that it was quite improper sightseeing dead people who chose that place as a graceful grave.",
          "Something different if you like those sort of things. Worth to see for sure. You can literary feel that you are moving back time. It could be little bit overwhelming if you are more sensitive but I recommend it.",

          "A bit same old, same old, but would have been more interesting if there was more information on the exhibits.",
          "Spooky in some ways but well worth.the visit",
          "Interesting place, but I don't know why people agree to have their bodies publicly displayed. Also surprised at the condition of the bodies when it's actually quite warm in the catacombs.",
          "An experience in its own... Definitely should make us happy to be alive!",
          "Unbelievable place. You can see all dead body. All they are different. It\u2019s really memorable place to me.",
          "It is okay, they tell you not to take photos to respect the dead, but at the entrance they sell all kinds of postcards with the corpses on them. So I just ignored and clicked a few shots. But pay attention, the place opens only after 3pm if you go in the afternoon. Entry was 3 euro as of March 2019.",
          "Big experience - even for the fainthearted..!\nKind of unreal being so close to death - and the dead. Impressive that they manage to keep the bodies in such a good shape - being dead as they are...\nIt's even a big experience for kids - makes them think and wonder.",

          "Nor scary at all",

          "Interesting but odd place lots of corridors filled with mummified bodies some still with their eyeballs. Some of then as young as 1900.  Far away from the Center. It's a long walk through some dodgy looking spots. I would recommend a taxi there. Can't take any pictures when your there",
          "Fascinating place, though a bit creepy. A unique place to visit. I wish there were leaflets in English so I understood more what it was all about.",
          "Trippy",
          "What can I say - I came to see dead bodies and I saw dead bodies. There are about 20,000 dried up corpses in different conditions there but obviously they are not all on display. It's a creep show if you scare easily. Prepare for \u2026",
          "Creepy place, but so intriguing.",
          "Crazy place. Worth a visit.",
          "Great catacombes, well spending 3 euro",
          "A must see for the fans of horror",
          "Spooky, the world's second frightening place!",
          "Nice",
          "Very spooky ,but tells a great story about the 18th century batrial rituals .",
          "Really amazing experience. Fascinating to see the clothes of the time still intact. also the various states of mummification all depended on the person doing the drying and stuffing, obviously some far better than others. not worth visiting \u2026",
          "Very intersting",
          "Nothing quite like it I've ever visited before or since - well worth a visit. Bit out of the way in the town but easy enough to get to. A creepy and possibly unsettling experience for some.\nThe Church 'staff' weren't that friendly though.",
          "Fabulous! Spooky. Katie would have hated it!",
          "A very creepy experience and absolutely worth a visit. There are many skeletons and mummies - most of them dressed like normal people (priests, doctors, monks, children in cribs and so on). Don\u00b4t even think about taking pictures because there is an angry man watching you over the CCTV...",
          "Really a unique encapsulation of a small part of human history.  Since I have not seen anything quite like this, I am grateful for the  unique experience.  ",
          "The place is good only for the fans of bones, skeletons and mummies. Not easy to get there if you don't know the city and italian language. It is rather far from the city center. The entrance fee is not high.",
          "It was pretty horrifying, but at least cheap. Overall I'd say you could skip it, but if seeing dead bodies like Skyrim in real life is your thing, then go for it.",
          "Very sinister. Shame some of the signs are not in English which was a bit annoying. Check your change. Man on the ticket office tried to short change us.",
          "Well worth a visit, once you've navigated the many one-way streets to get there (and don't pay for parking outside, despite the local beggars' insistence). There are many, many bodies in various states and a very alive, loud and scary man \u2026",

          "Creepy but extremely interesting. A place to visit the dead!!",
          "Visiting the catacombs is certainly interesting - but not everyone is like that. It is strange to see so many corpses in such a small space. There are adults, children, families ... Lying or hanging figures in various stages of \u2026",

          "Great place",
          "Scary if you keep in mind these are all real human bones... 3\u20ac also seemed fine. No photography allowed though!",
          "sad place. interesting to a point - you dont view corpses in normal life. however for the church to be making so much money displaying them yet showing so little care for the remains left me dismayed. the corridors are not adapted in any \u2026",

          "More interesting for the types of clothing than the mummified remains.  That said the exceptional state of the child R Lombardi is remarkable. Current cost \u20ac3 (Nov 2013).  Worth it.",
          "If you aren't  a easy scary  person, that will be a amazing experience! The entrance  are only 3\u20ac . And you can see 1252 mummies. Inside are diferents  places with rooms for kids mummies, woman, priests, officers, virgins.  And, in the end you can se the most news mummies, and THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MUMMI  IN THE WORLD : ROSALIA LOMBARDO.",

          "It is a great place to see if you have a stone heart. You will see mummies from 16th century till 20th (1920 the last one is brought there). \n\nInteresting thing: Nicolae Balcescu is buried there in the common place.",

          "Weird place. I'm really hesitating whether it has made me put some thoughts into the meaning of life and death or is it simply unnecessary and brutal exhibitionism.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Church of St. Mary of the Admiral (Italian: Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio), also called Martorana, is the seat of the Parish of San Nicol\u00f2 dei Greci (Albanian: Klisha e Sh\u00ebn Kollit s\u00eb Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet), overlooking the Piazza Bellini in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. \nThe church is a Co-cathedral to the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, a diocese which includes the Italo-Albanian (Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb) communities in Sicily who officiate the liturgy according to the Byzantine Rite in the ancient Greek language and Albanian language The Church bears witness to the Eastern religious and artistic culture still present in Italy today, further contributed by the Albanian exiles who took refuge in southern Italy and Sicily from the 15th century under the pressure of Turkish-Ottoman persecutions in Albania and the Balkans. The latter influence has left considerable traces in the painting of icons, in the religious rite, in the language of the parish, in the traditional customs of some Albanian colonies in the province of Palermo. The community is part of the Catholic Church, but follows the ritual and spiritual traditions that largely share it with the Orthodox Church.\nThe church is characterized by the multiplicity of styles that meet, because, with the succession of centuries, it was enriched by various other tastes in art, architecture and culture. Today, it is, in fact, as a church-historical monument, the result of multiple transformations, also subject to protection.\nSince 3 July 2015 it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site within the Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale itinerary.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name Ammiraglio (\"admiral\") derives from the founder of the church, the Sirian christian admiral and principal minister of King Roger II of Sicily, George of Antioch. The foundation charter of the church (which was initially Eastern Orthodox), in ancient Greek and Arabic, is preserved and dates to 1143; construction may already have begun at this point. The church had certainly been completed by the death of George in 1151, and he and his wife were interred in the narthex. In 1184 the Arab traveller Ibn Jubayr visited the church, and later devoted a significant portion of his description of Palermo to its praise, describing it as \"the most beautiful monument in the world.\" After the Sicilian Vespers of 1282 the island's nobility gathered in the church for a meeting that resulted in the Sicilian crown being offered to Peter III of Aragon.In 1193-94, a convent of Benedictine nuns was founded on adjacent property by Eloisa Martorana. In 1433-34, under the rule of King Alfonso of Aragon, this convent absorbed the church, which has since then been commonly known as La Martorana.  The nuns extensively modified the church between the 16th century and the 18th century, making major changes to the structure and the interior decoration.The nuns of the Martorana were famous for their moulded marzipan, which they made in the form of various fruits. Although the convent no longer exists, frutta di Martorana are still one of Palermo's most famous and distinctive foodstuffs.\nIn 1937 the church returned to the Byzantine rite with the Albanian community present in Palermo. Today, it is used by the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church for their services and shares cathedral status with the church cathedral of San Demetrio Megalomartire in Piana degli Albanesi.\nThe church assumed and inherited the title of seat of the parish of the Italo-Albanians residing in San Nicol\u00f2 dei Greci (for \"Greeks\" those Albanian populations were exchanged which, from the fifteenth century in Italy and Sicily, kept \"Greek rite\" or Byzantine, language, customs, identity) in 1945, after the homonymous church adjacent to the Italo-Albanian Seminary of Palermo was destroyed in the Second World War.\nThe church was recently restored and reopened for community worship in 2013; at that juncture clergy and the community was momentarily welcomed in the church of the Santa Macrina of the Italian-Albanian Basilian nuns in Palermo.\nThe parish of San Nicol\u00f2 dei Greci does not have a real parish territory, but is the reference point for 15,000 faithful Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb  (the Albanian community of Sicily historically settled in the province of Palermo) residing in the city and who professes the Byzantine rite.\nSince 2015, the airport of the \"Arab-Norman Itinerary of Palermo, Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\" as a World Heritage Site is one of the monuments proposed by UNESCO.\n\n\n=== The name of the Parish ===\n\nBy tradition it continues to be called \"of the Greeks\", an improper definition, since the parish belongs ecclesiastically to the Albanians of Sicily (Albanesi di Sicilia in Italian). Greek was defined - by to the not Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people, the Latins - the Byzantine rite for the liturgical language used. There is, however, the increasingly used variant today of \"Parrocchia San Nicol\u00f2 or Nicola degli Italo-Albanesi\".\nIt is called by its faithful albanophones \"Klisha Arb\u00ebreshe Palerm\u00eb\" or simply \"Marturan\u00eb\" and in the non-colloquial version \"Famullia / Klisha e Sh\u00ebn Kollit i Arb\u00ebresh\u00ebvet n\u00eb Palerm\u00eb\". You can also often read the title \"Parrocchia San Nicol\u00f2 dei Greci alla Martorana\", this to mean that the parish is now based in the \"Martorana\" and not in the initial location in Via Seminario Italo-Albanese.\n\n\n== Liturgy and rite ==\n\nThe liturgical rites, the wedding ceremonies, the baptism and the festivities religious of the parish of San Nicol\u00f2 dei Greci follow the Byzantine calendar and the Albanian tradition of the communities of the Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi.\nThe languages liturgical used are the ancient Greek (as per tradition, which was born to unify all the peoples of the Eastern Church under a single language of understanding) or Albanian (the mother tongue of the parish community). It is not uncommon here to hear the priest and the faithful speaking habitually in Albanian, in fact the language is the main element that identifies them in a specific belonging ethnic. Some young woman from Piana degli Albanesi marries still wearing the rich wedding dress of the Albanian tradition and the ceremony of the marriage (martesa).\nA special celebration for the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb population is the Theophany or Blessing of the waters on 6 January ( Uj\u00ebt e pag\u00ebzuam ); the most important festival is Easter (Pashk\u00ebt), with the oriental rituals of strong spirituality of Holy Week (Java e Madhe) and the singing of Christos anesti - Krishti u ngjall (Christ is risen). On 6 December occurs the feast of Saint Nicholas (Dita e Sh\u00ebn Kollit).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe original church was built in the form of a compact cross-in-square (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common variation on the standard middle Byzantine church type. The three apses in the east adjoin directly on the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in contemporary Byzantine architecture in the Balkans and Asia Minor. In the first century of its existence the church was expanded in three distinct phases; first through the addition of a narthex to house the tombs of George of Antioch and his wife; next through the addition of a forehall; and finally through the construction of a centrally-aligned campanile at the west. The campanile, which is richly decorated with three orders of arches and lodges with mullioned windows, still serves as the main entrance to the church. Significant later additions to the church include the Baroque fa\u00e7ade which today faces onto the piazza. In the late 19th century, historically-minded restorers attempted to return the church to its original state, although many elements of the Baroque modifications remain.Certain elements of the original church, in particular its exterior decoration, show the influence of Islamic architecture on the culture of Norman Sicily. A frieze bearing a dedicatory inscription runs along the top of the exterior walls; although its text is in Greek, its architectural form references the Islamic architecture of north Africa. The recessed niches on the exterior walls are likewise derive from the Islamic architectural tradition. In the interior, a series of wooden beams at the base of the dome bear a painted inscription in Arabic; the text is derived from the Christian liturgy (the Epinikios Hymn and the Great Doxology). The church also boasted an elaborate pair of carved wooden doors, today installed in the south fa\u00e7ade of the western extension, which relate strongly to the artistic traditions of Fatimid north Africa. On account of these \"Arabic\" elements, the Martorana has been compared with its Palermitan contemporary, the Cappella Palatina, which exhibits a similar hybrid of Byzantine and Islamic forms.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe church is renowned for its spectacular interior, which is dominated by a series of 12th century mosaics executed by Byzantine craftsmen. The mosaics show many iconographic and formal similarities to the roughly contemporary programs in the Cappella Palatina, in Monreale Cathedral and in Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral, although they were probably executed by a distinct atelier.The walls display two mosaics taken from the original Norman fa\u00e7ade, depicting King Roger II, George of Antioch's lord, receiving the crown of Sicily from Jesus, and, on the northern side of the aisle, George himself, at the feet of the Virgin. The depiction of Roger was highly significant in terms of its iconography. In Western Christian tradition, kings were customarily crowned by the Pope or his representatives; however, Roger is shown in Byzantine dress being crowned by Jesus in the Byzantine fashion. Roger was renowned for presenting himself as an emperor during his reign, being addressed as basileus (\"king\" in ancient Greek). The mosaic of the crowning of Roger carries a Latin inscription written in ancient Greek characters (Rogerios Rex \u03a1\u039f\u0393\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u03a1\u0397\u039e \"king Roger\").\nThe nave dome is occupied by the traditional byzantine image of Christ Pantokrator surrounded by the archangels St Michael, St Gabriel, St Raphael and St Uriel. The register below depicts the eight prophets of the Old Testament and, in the pendentives, the four evangelists of the New Testament. The nave vault depicts the Nativity and the Death of the Virgin.\nThe newer part of the church is decorated with later frescoes of comparatively little artistic significance. The frescoes in the middle part of the walls are from the 18th century, attributed to Guglielmo Borremans.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\nArb\u00ebresh\u00eb\nEparchy of Piana degli Albanesi\nEastern Christianity\nByzantine Rite\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Green Guide: Sicily (Michelin, 2003)\nPatrizia Fabbri, Palermo e Monreale (Bonechi, 2005)\nIrving Hexham and David Bershad, The Christian Travelers' Guide to Italy (Zondervan, 2001)\nErnst Kitzinger, with Slobodan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107, The mosaics of St. Mary's of the Admiral in Palermo (Washington, 1990).

          "This is an amazing little gem easy to miss. It belongs to the Albanian/Arb\u00ebresh eparchy, which kept the eastern orthodox rite since they arrived here in 15th century fleeing from Turks in their homeland. The liturgy is in old Greek and old Albanian. The frescoes are divine. A",
          "Take a seat inside you will need time to absorb the sight. The interior design is full of symmetry from the ceiling to the floor, side isles. After sitting for awhile walk around and look at the paintings. Then step outside and marvel at the architecture of the whole building",
          "The pearl of Palermo's architecture has lived quietly for many centuries under three names. Santa Maria Dell'ammiraglio-Saint Mary of the Admiral refers us to the main sponsor of the construction, the Admiral of king Roger II, the Orthodox Greek George of Antioch. Because of",
          "I visted this beautiful old church some fours years ago on a organized tour with thankfully knowledgeable guides. - a scene of historic and artistic wonder, but unfortunately rather crowded when we visited. I seem to remember a remarkable mosaic showing King Roger being",
          "The last time we visited, we were only able to see the mosaics from the back of the church for a minute or two as it was about to shut. This time, we made sure to visit when you were free to walk around and I would advise you to do the same. It's a small church but the mosaics",
          "Very small church to bring together Greek and baroque at the same place. Beautiful mosaics, amazing lighting, beautiful choral music as a background. A truly amazing experience. Take a sit, admire the ceiling and listen.",
          "The mosiacs in this church are beautiful.You never expect to see such a wonder before you enter. Not to be missed.",
          "Another great historical site to visit in Palermo. The workmanship and effort put into the site is impressive.",
          "I wanted to see it as part of my trip - the artwork is beyond words. The bakery above was so inviting - but time was short. The history was so sad.",
          "The most amazing example of the Byzantine Churches and mosaics in Palermo. The best time to see its beautiful mosaics is the early morning, when the sun rays make them shining...",
          "Another amazingly beautiful church decorated with Byzantine mosaics of the highest artistic level, absolutely beautiful. The whole interior seems to shine due to golden backgrounds of mosaics. It was not the first place we visited in Palermo but would certainly go there again.",
          "We then went inside the Church of St Mary dell Ammiraglio which still uses Greek Orthodox rites and is a mix of baroque and Byzantine interior design. It predates the Norman Palace chapel by a few years and has yet more of the glorious golden mosaics.",
          "A beautiful little church with stunning Byzantine mosaics. It can get a little crowded but the beauty left us in awe. My pictures can never do justice to the mosaics.",
          "This is a must see if you are visiting Palermo even if only for a few hours. It is situated in a small square just off the street crossing in the centre of town and is a delight of byzantine and orthodox decoration. The ceilings and walls are stunning in such a compact space.",
          "We moved from the relative austerity of San Cataldo (Norman church alongside La Matorana) into a Byzantine church with many beautiful mosaics. It was a great introduction to the glories we saw later at the Palatine Chapel and also at the Cathedral at Monreale. Well worth a visit",
          "Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio (La Martorana) represents the history of Palermo. It combines Arab, Norman, Byzantine, and Baroque elements. Like Palermo itself, the effect is uneven and even contradictory. That's history. Most visitors on the day I was there went gaga over",
          "Wonderful church richly decorated with some of the best Byzantine style mosaics you will see anywhere. Simply breathtaking. Not to be missed.",
          "Church is stunning inside and worth taking time to wander round. The mosaics are amazing, not too expensive to get in",
          "The church is beautiful and if you pay for the ticket, you get a discount in the church next to it. Not everyone knows that on the opposite side of the square there is a monastery - well wort a visit as well!",

          "Possibly my favourite church out of all that we visited, lovely feel about it, amazing decoration. I would say its a must see.",
          "A real joy to visit. The baroque is a later refurb (though pleasing to the eye), but the mosaics and general structure are the originals. Having read about the Normans years ago, I was especially looking forward to seeing this church and it didn't disappoint. Paid for by George",
          "La Martorana is situated right next to San Cataldo. Both churches incorporate features from the time of the Normans. The Martorana's colourful interior contrasts with the spartan San Cataldo but together they provide an insight into the arab-norman architectural fusion in",
          "This church is a one-stop shop to understand the history of Palermo and its diversity. Highly recommend touring the church with a guide to get the best experience. Worth the very reasonable entry fee.",

          "We had some issues here with overcrowding. At the time of our visit, tour groups filled this quite small church and their guides were speaking in different languages. It made moving around inside difficult, and it wasn\u2019t really possible to enjoy the interior in a quiet way. I",

          "Don't think I will ever see another church quite like it ever again. Rivals the Cistene Chapel in Rome easily",
          "A most beautiful little church. Amazing to consider that all these beautiful mosaics have survived over the centuries. A church not to miss",
          "The art and mosaics in the church are absolutely wonderful, with a mix of Byzantine, baroque, etc. in paintings and mosaics, but the tour guides preaching loudly to their customers and ruining the view of the ceiling with their laser pointers should be banned.",
          "Splendid mosaics in between the baroque paintings, wonderful to see Christ crown Roger II, the first Norman King of Sicily and one of the first civilized Vikings of his time. A must for art lovers!",
          "Not much to look at on the outside, but this is breathtaking inside. It remains my #1 top memory from my entire 3 weeks in Sicily last year. I have recommended this little chapel to so many friends and fellow travelers, and thought I should add a TripAdvisor review too. The",

          "This is next to St. Cataldo. If you show your ticket, you can get a small discount on your admission fee. I love the wonderful mosaics in all the Norman churches whose interiors have survived numerous earthquakes. Lovely setting and well-worth your time.",
          "This was the first of many churches we visited while in Palermo -our entry fee allowed us discounts at other churches.It small but light from the windows allows you see the incredible mosaics in such detail -my favourite was that of Roger 11 feet firmly on the ground being",
          "I liked this better than the cathedral for mosaics. In the center of town, this historic place was lovely",
          "This church and the one next to it is worth a visit. From the outside the church does not look spectacular or exiting but inside you will be surprised. All over wonderful mosaics. The church next to it with the 3 cupolas is very different (much more sober). I liked both very",
          "For its size, well, it's got an enormous wow factor. The mosaics are extensive , elaborate and beautiful. And as a massive lover of mosaics, particularly quality, high quality mosaics, this place is heaven. It's another one of those places in this trip where I went twice in one",
          "Stunning Norman style mosaics and frescoes with an impressive pantocrator. It can get very crowded, go early!",
          "The moment you enter this 12th century church you will be in complete awe. The Byzantine mosaics literally overwhelm you by their beauty, colors, and detail. The expressions on the Saints faces are so real. It\u2019s hard to believe that artisans of any period in history could",
          "Similar to capella Palatina, or Duomo of monreale in style, but smaller and more intimate. Partially rebuilt in different style during the baroque period, so look for where the two styles join and contrast.",
          "The most interesting thing about this church is that you can make a good comparison between the byzantine and the baroque style, since they're so harmoniously situated one next to the other. For me it's a tie... Anyway, beautiful church and the 2 euro admission is nothing",
          "Notice the mosaic on the right: It\u00b4s Christ himself, who crowns the king Roger II. All the other mosaics are beautifull.",
          "Not typical western-world church architecture. I see elements of Islamic architecture on the exterior. The interior also isn\u2019t standard western-world, but it is extremely magnificent. I have been in many places of worship and of many faiths over the years, and this one seems",
          "Although the church is not that impressive from the outside, the interior is filled with gold mosaics, and Arabic influence. It currently is an Albanian/Italian church. Palermo has several beautiful churches, each with their own glory. Be sure to check the entry times as many",
          "Beautiful church, i call it beautiful because there is Islamic flavor in architecture as the church was built Arab workers and when you look at the domes on building, you can totally feel it. Worth to visit",
          "Situated next to the San Cataldo church in Piazza Bellini, this is a complete contrast in styles although also built in 12th century. The interior has stunning mosaics similar to those in the Palatine Chapel and Monreale cathedral. Do check the opening hours though which did",
          "This church is marvellous summary of Sicily history in one place, build on ancient city walls, in Romanesque style with Gothic-influenced campanile. Inside are beautiful mosaics, accompanied by tasteful frescoes. Interestingly, the church is currently run by Albanians and so the",
          "Mosaics are in excellent condition. Fee to enter is reasonable. Also see church of Saint Cataldo next door.",
          "The next time I go, I'd like to attend a service since I read that it's an Albanian-Italian church that follows the Greek service. The exterior is nothing special, but the interior floor plan and mosaics are fantastic. There was once a convent adjacent and the nuns there made",
          "The sober facade of the Byzantine Church has a beautiful bell tower as a portal. Its interior amazes by the beautiful Byzantine mosaics that are in the floor, walls, domes, in the Abside a fantastic Christ Pantocrator stand mixed with beautiful Italian frescoes",
          "We were fortunate enough to be given a tour of Palermo by a couple who grew up and who still live in Palermo. They took us to Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, as this was the church they were married in. My husband and both agree that this is one of the most beautiful churches we've",
          "It is another wonderful Unesco world Heritage site. Amazing mosaics and a lot of history . Built in 1143 AD . Easy to come by, surrounded by alot of other beautiful historic sites.",
          "From the outside this church in the historic centre of Palermo does not look promising, since the front was redone in baroque style. However, inside the central part dating from the 12th century is decorated with magnificent mosaics in Byzantine style. This is one of the",
          "This church has one the most impressive interiors in Palermo! It is decorated with stunning mosaics with golden background and narrates the life moments of Jesus. The mosaics have greek inscriptions because it was ordered from George of Antiochia and it was to operate as an",
          "La Martorana a Unesco World Heritage site is a jewel that shouldn't be missed. It was originally built in 1143 and later enlarged in the Baroque period. It is a unique blend of Norman features decorated with stuccos and enamel work. Some of the work is very similar to that of",
          "I'd heard so much about it as a jewel. And so it was! The feeling you get when you enter this ancient church is exactly that of being inside a jewel, with its lights, gold, colors and the incredible work of Christian and Arab artists, the mysticism that emanates this place fills",
          "Loved it and this should actually sum up my impression. I did fall in love with Palermo and the Norman/Arabic influence on its architecture. La Martonara is wonderful... I could have started at it for hours.",
          "We read about these two little 12th century churches and were unprepared for just how amazing they were. The opulence of this church and the painting/ mosaics are some of finest we have ever seen. Please be respectful and soak in the atmosphere.",
          "A person can be overwhelmed walking into this 12th century church commissioned by the Norman king of Sicily, Roger II. He was originally from Greece. The church has Norman arches with a Byzantine style. The mosaics throughout the church were well preserved and beautiful.",
          "Decorated much like the Duomo in Monreale, but on a smaller scale. Very elaborate mosaics on the wall make it worth a visit. By showng our ticket from the church of St. Catherine we received a \u20ac1 discount on the admission.",
          "This building has been substantially remodelled in a baroque manner, but it is still well worth a visit for the remaining Byzantine mosaics. The Nativity scene is gently intimate, while the image of Christ in the dome is a breathtaking combination of art and architecture.",
          "this church has it all - all the different styles in one place - this is a unique find - could have spent hours and hours here - so much to see Again if you get the opportunity to buy the ticket that lets you get into most of the churches do it - it is worth it",
          "The church has limited open hours. We waited a half hour for opening and it was worth the wait.Gold mosaic eye candy beyond belief. What a way to learn the Scriptures.",
          "At the entrance, there is a mesmerizing tower. Inside, for 2 euros, the splendid mosaics can be admired in half of the church, while the other half looks more recent.",
          "You might imagine that a mere church could line up pretty poorly against the magnificent Norman Palatine Chapel, the Cathedral at Cefalu and the Cathedral at Monreale but think again. Magnificent decoration and mosaic work everywhere. Overtime for the camera again. Don\u2019t",
          "The church of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio is an 11th century gem. It is well worth the 2 Euro admission charge. The mosaics inside on both the walls and ceiling are superb. Right next to the Norman church of San Cabral.",
          "La Martorana has a fascinating history but today its one of the churches where you can see the wonderful Norman architecture and Roger mosaics alongside the generational architectural changes which were considered to be more suitable as the centuries passed. Here are the",
          "A friend recommended visiting this church and it is absolutely amazing. If you don't have many days in Palermo, make sure you visit this church.",
          "Founded in 1143, the church was decorated with beautiful golden mosaics around the same time as Montreale Cathedral. Later extended in baroque style, it is now an Orthodox church, and well worth a visit.",
          "We stopped in to view a wedding in progress. Was only able to take a few pictures out of respect for the wedding party. Another awesome church.",
          "This church has a beautiful interior and it is so relaxing just to sit inside and look at the mosaics. There are two more churches around, so you can visit them too.",
          "Palermo and surrounds has 4 astonishing sites where Byzantine mosaics can be seen. They are all stunning. Cefalu, Monreale, Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, and the Palatine chapel. Visit them in that order if you do the Palatine Chapel first it will eclipse the other 3.",
          "Three churches in the same square seem too many. In fact, they are so utterly different from one another, they form a perfect trio. Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio has the most attractive belltower of the three, an elegant, lofty Norman structure made of blond sandstone.",
          "This church could easily be overlooked. For a small entrance fee, which gives a discounted entry to other nearby churches, you can see wonderful Norman Byzantine mosaics. You can get a little closer to them than in Monreale and Cefal\u00fa. The choir, nave and domed crossing have",
          "This is one of the must-see churches on the Palermo UNESCO World Heritage list of Arab-Norman art and architecture. Apparently, the nuns who ran this place in the 17th century destroyed many of the original mosaics, but fortunately they left us plenty of masterpieces to enjoy.",
          "The mosaics were beautiful and they worth a visit and paying the entrance. Be careful because it is not opened all day long.",

          "Beautiful 12th century church covered in sparkling mosaics and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site that includes the Monreale Cathedral and other buildings in the area. This church closes down for a long lunch so be sure to check the hours.",

          "A Unesco world heritage site with fabulous architecture . A terrific mix of Byzantine mosaics and Baroque decor , an amazing place!",
          "We didn't schedule enough time to spend here, which, like everything in Palermo, takes some time to get to because of the bad traffic. The area is quite crowded, so parking is hard to find, but it sure was worth it. A spectacular church!",
          "This incredible and breathtaking church is one of the most beautiful of Italy......Never seen something like this. Don't miss it!",
          "A beautiful little gem, crowded but a must visit nonetheless. Interesting mixture of styles, stunning gold and blue mosaics. Entry was around 2 euros.",

          "This is a beautiful church with all the decorations in mosaic gold being the predominant feature. The mosaics are a blend of Muslim, Byzantine and western catholic styles and are extraordinary The visit took approx 30 mins and it was greatly helped having an audio tour of the",

          "Located in the Piazza Bellini, the church is next to the famous Pretoria Fountain and Quattro Canti square. Inside this fabulous building, the design and artwork is again sublime \u2013 The main dome features a golden mosaic of Christ and the ceilings and arches are full of frescos",
          "This church in Palermo, Sicily started the construction in 1143. Superbly crafted and finished with mosaic tiles. Gold, blue and unique colours. Fully functional and we didn\u2019t pay to see it. May be because there was a wedding service about to start. Must see church in Palermo.",
          "A highlight if you are interested in churches and a must to see in Palermo. Great cultural experience.",
          "This elegant church has simply superb mosaics. One of the things I appreciated here was that there were chairs to sit on and admire the mosaics from all angles [and to rest your neck occasionally!]. Binoculars will show up extra detail.",
          "Wonderful church with amazing mosaics. We purchased the entry tickets for \"il circuito del sacro\" which allows discounted entry for selected other churches.",
          "Italian Greek Catholic Church located in Piazza Bellini in the centre of palermo. The church is renowned for its spectacular interior, which is dominated by 12th century mosaics.",
          "It was very crowded, and it seemed to be led tours from cruise ships. Still, that's not the building's fault so still five stars (blobs?) for a truly superb interior (well, most of it anyway). Ignore the horrible baroque frontage and the extensions inside, tacked on to the",
          "Although it was difficult to find the times the church was open, it is well worth your time to try to get inside. Beautiful with golden mosaic tiles, this church is small and quite an architectural feat.",
          "A lovely church, beuatifuly decorated. There is another church bang next door that is even more beautiful.",
          "Even though they charge 1 Euro to see the inside of the church, it is very well worth your visit. You also have to pay to see the monastery - gorgeous garden and artwork.",
          "If you want to see mosaics take the bus up to Monreale to see them in a beautiful cathedral, for free. We went up to Monreale in the morning, and then Santa Maria in the afternoon. We paid 7 Euros per person, but the royal apartments were closed so the only thing we were able to",

          "Absolutly enjoyed my time here. The Baroque style facade and the Byzantine dome was just amazingly rich and beautiful. The majesty and the lavishness of the interior art work and mosaics took my breath away. A fine example of medieval multiculturalism. Just wish I had the",
          "One of the oldest churches in Palermo dating back to XI AD. Great examples of multicultural and multi-religon co-existance.",
          "This is a peculiar church to visit. You can admire and take one beautiful photos from the corner that you will see from the fountain (Piazza Pretoria). I don't like the fact that there is a fee to enter and not donations.",

          "if you are in Palermo then there are so many sites to visit and this is one of the major attractions",

          "This is a lovely old church. It is quite small but it's easily accessible, peaceful, and has some glorious mosaics which are a joy to behold. Truly deserves to be on the UNESCO Heritage list. If you ask you get a discount when visiting the adjoining church...but it's not well",
          "The twelfth cent. Byzantine artisans were at the top of their form, albeit a little late for my taste. The size and proportion of the church make the mosaics accessible and personal. The gentle Pantocrator is full-length. The palm and fruit trees are charming.",
          "Fabulous place to visit.Spectacular building and so much to see. It is quite busy when we went, but a must.",
          "This is one of the top sights to be seen in Palermo and I dare anybody to be disappointed by the majesty of the interior mosaics.",
          "The church of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, also known as \"La Martorana\", is an almost compulsory stop for a sensible tour of Palermo, together with the neighboring church of San Cataldo. It is a typical mix of styles as you would often find in Palermo, result of the continue",
          "This church has great and unique architecture and is easy to find, but after seeing pictures here from the inside I even more regret we didn't had time to go inside and enjoy that as well.",
          "Located just behind the main square on Palermo this beautiful little church is a wonderful sight to see... Amazing",
          "Nice stop for a quick look at wonderful architecture as we wandered Palermo, which is the highlight of the city.",
          "Nice church good place to visit while walking round Palermo. Also nice piazza near by to sit out in having a drink. Visiting the chalked you have to pay for keep the ticket and get discuout in other churches.",
          "The church was small but it was a beautiful one. By paying the entrance fee, you get a discount in other churches around. Go this Church first before you visit the church beside which has 3 pink dome on top.",
          "Fabulous example of Palermo's (and Sicily's) heterogeneous cultural and historical background. Once inside, mind the top of the first column on your right, which bares Arabic writings (it was taken from one of Palermo's mosques and used by the Normans as building material,",
          "This place is just amazing to look at. I would have loved a bit more of a tour, but to be fair I didn't ask. Amazing hand painted walls and mosaic flooring.",
          "Very detailed and beautiful church. A bit busy with tours but you could still enjoy it. We got a discount from visiting the surrounding churches as well so it was a very affordable stop.",
          "The beauty of this church is stunning, but I also enjoyed the history of it. King Roger II, Norman, had this built and it is dedicated to a woman who made marzipan, but made with Arab and other architects. Check the history of Roger before visiting this church. He was quite",
          "Forty years ago I found myself at a wedding in this church. This time, there was another one! Visitors don't get shepherded out, so watching is part of the experience. The church is a lovely combination of rich dim gold mediaeval mosaics and later baroque painted architectural",
          "While not as incredible as monreale or the Palatine chapel, a fabulous monument and don't complain about the 2 euros. Same for more simple chapel next door.",
          "This is an absolute gem- amongst the best of Norman 'Romanesque' architecture infused with Byzantine charm and created by Arab craftsmen. Palermo was the 'poster boy ' of medieval multiculturalism and this intimate structure is sumptuously decorated with mosaics and gold leaf.",
          "All of the church's had fabulous architecture if you like this kind of thing then you will love it here, every corner has another building to reflect the way they have been built...",
          "This has to be one of the most beautiful churches in the world. We were prepared to be impressed but this far exceeded our expectations. A must-see In amazing Palermo.",
          "The small church of Santa Maria dell' Ammiraglio is outstanding example of the mixture of medieval mosaic decoration with later wall painting. The whole impression is pleasant. Although not so magnificent as Monreale Cathedral and Capella Palatina the Martorana church is equally",
          "The Norman Arab architecture and decoration is just spectacular - I loved the mosaic works here. If you can't make it to Monreale (and every if you can), this is such a treat!",
          "Anyone interested in mosaics should visit this church, the 3 euro per couple charge is more than worth it",
          "What it lacks in size it makes up for in beauty. We've probably been to over 20 churches in the last month in Italy and this was one of my favourites. It's also cheap to visit at \u20ac2 relative to the other churches in Palermo that charge more and aren't half as nice. If you go to",
          "Gorgeous and historically full of meanings: you could spend a lot of time inside. Unfortunately the available explanation were too syntetic: a guide would be convenient",
          "What a stunning church, with an amazing and multifaceted history. Absolutely gorgeous from the inside. Unique.",
          "A must see in Palermo with a truly stunning interior which takes your breath away - the mosaics were out of this world!",
          "My wife and I visited the Chiesa Della Martorana in Palermo during a two-week vacation in Sicily. There is a modest entry fee (Euro 2 pp) and the ticket will give the user a discount at some other sites, although we discovered this too late to benefit from it. The interior is",
          "This church has a fascinating mixture of different designs and styles from various eras. The mosaics together with the ceiling paintings are quite unique. On some days local school children volunteer as tourist guide and are very happy to explain the history and architecture to",
          "The outside of this church (old and worn) hides the magnificence inside. Easy to miss, or just walk by, but make sure you see it. Beautiful church, with many mosaics and sculptures...including the only known portrait of King Roger himself.",
          "Along with most of the churches & palaces in Palermo, Santa Maria would benefit from cleaning works (not necessarily restoration as this would belie the ageing process) but it's definitely worth a look at both the outside & the inside.",
          "A little late in the morning, we benefited from a sunny day that helped a lot for natural light pictures inside the church. The elements of orthodox decoration are beautiful and the mosaics are worthwhile of a careful look.",
          "This is a lovely church; not so small except if it is being compared to the much larger cathedrals around it. It was quite intimate though and had such lovely gold mosaics to be explored. My young niece (8) and nephew (10) even loved it and enjoyed trying to make out the scenes",
          "The church is characterized by the multiplicity of styles that meet, because, with the succession of centuries, it was enriched by various other tastes in art, architecture and culture. Today, it is, in fact, as a church-historical monument, the result of multiple",
          "Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio is a small church and it is somewhat ordinary on the outside, but the inside is amazing and extremely beautiful. The front of the church is the original part and it is decorated entirely in mosaic tiles. The rear was an extension (I forget the exact",
          "There are bigger and grander mosaics in Palermo bit this is the best place to see them in detail. The church is small and so you can get closer to them. Less busy than the Palatina which is awash with groups of bored looking Italian school children",
          "Unlike some of the bigger churches, the smaller size of this church brings much of the amazing beauty closer for a more intimate inspection. Centrally located it is easy to find in your visit to Quattro Canti.",
          "Visited while on a walking tour of the city. Nothing outstanding about the outside of the church so it is a surprise to see such amazing decoration inside. History of the church is interesting as it was originally planned as a mosque but was later given over to a group of",
          "This is how the inside of the cathedral used to look before the disastrous modernization. Marvelous golden mosaics take you back 900 years. A small fee but worth it. Note:Save your ticket and get half off at other churches",
          "Special place with Arab and Norman influences off a beautiful, quiet square, with adjacent Church of San Cantaldo. Both are open just for a few hrs each morning and afternoon w a small entry fee.",
          "Dates to 1143, built on a Greek cross plan. Baroque interior. Stuccoes and enamel art. This cathedral is nice but average. Nothing not to like here but just not one of my favorite places in Sicily. If this review is helpful then please indicate so below.",
          "This church was built around 1150 by a Greek: George of Antioch, an admiral of Roger II. Roger II is a story in himself...check out his home, the Palazzo Real. La Martorana was built with a cross plan. It is chock full of over-the-top frescoes (1600s), and grillwork, and of",
          "Such a beautiful church. The style is so different compared to some of the other Churches in Palermo. The intricate design and the blues and golds are simply beautiful. I would definitely recommend visiting this church.",
          "This is an amazing place, beautiful on the outside but quite magnificent on the inside. A great mixture of styles - arab, baroque and byzantine. But what makes it so stunning are the mosaics which seem to cover the whole of the walls and ceiling. I have never seen mosaics of",
          "It was pretty on the outside but closed on sunday. We felt a little insecure because when we went, the place were alone and there were 3 or four gipsies asking for money and they started to insult us because we didn't gave them any money.",
          "This was an amazing church that I was not expecting. After seeing the cathedral in Monreale, which blew me away, it was awesome to see what is basically a smaller version of the same. Wonderful mosaics, beautiful stone, and a mixture between the arab, baroque and byzantine, with",
          "Along with Monreale Cathedral and Cappella Palatina, this Byzantine mosaic and painted cathedral is stunning. The trio of churches are in the top ranks of mosaic sites you will see any where in the world. Right in the center of Palermo and near other attractions, this is",
          "if you visit this, you can save yourself a trip to Monreale - same type of Byzantine mosaics (but without the view over Palermo)",
          "A small church in the middle of the historical part of Palermo, that is a must-go when visiting the city. I was able to visit is for free, but the ticket is not expensive anyway and it's totally worth the visit. A small and interesting church from the outside, that reveals",
          "Pure history and art in this church from medieval times. Beautiful ceilings with bizantino art, wonderful mosaics and relics from the past. A must see piece of art.",
          "I was just plain mesmerized by the mosaics and the other art. This place is loaded wth masterpieces and should not be missed. Sublime art.",
          "Just visited here. What a wonderful place. Spectacular inside and out. Beautiful mosaic work. Recommended for certain.",
          "Just visit this....similar style to the Capella Palatina but somehow more intimate, with some different touches too",
          "Impressive church, not only from the eclectic outside, but also from the inside. I visited Monreale and Capella Palatine, when I was in Palermo, but this church was the more intimate experience. Furthermore the mix between baroque paintings and the mosaics make this a unique",
          "The exterior may not be inviting but the interior is breathtaking with golden complex mosaics. Worth a visit!",
          "It deserve a visit as one of the most impressive byzantine catholic church I have ever seen. Spectacular interiors, mosaics,frescoes. In a nutshell \"unbelievable\"",
          "This fabulous church rewards the visitor who spends time here contemplating its wonderful Greek byzantine mosaics, blended with later Renaissance paintings towards the back of the church. There is such a wealth of religious detail here, seen from the Eastern Roman viewpoint but",
          "Immerse yourself in beauty... the mosaics are so beautiful. For us, a bit of a bus ride, but completely worth the effort! Do leave yourself enough time, and check the hours.",
          "This church, in the center of Palermo is quintessential Sicily, an island which has been a colony foe 3000 years and where dozen occupying civilization built with their own style churches and palaces. This is a church built by normans but with layers upon layers of contributions",
          "The exterior of the church was underwhelming, but that quickly changed was you entered inside. This small church gave us a small tease of the mosaics we would see the next day at Monreale. These mosaics were just as impressive. Another interesting thing was that the church also",
          "This splendid church displays decoration from the 12th to18th centuries, from mosaics to stucco. It includes a famous mosaic portrait of the crowning of King Roger.",
          "When we first tried to see it, there was a wedding going on. So we came back another day and we are glad we did. The mosiacs and colors were very memorable.",
          "Lovely church on the inside. We entered just before a wedding was about to take place, beautiful inside.",
          "Wonderful church ,nice atmosphere ,well preserved site.many other interesting places around .a nice walk from piazza Politeama .guru the main Street of the spanish Palermo .",

          "Came here to see, what a beautiful church so many details and serenity it is a real treasure around this beautiful city",
          "This church is not grand in scale, yet the mosaics are visually arresting. The architecture is simple in style. It's definitely worth visiting.",
          "When we arrived we only had 30 minutes to visit the church because of a wedding taking place later. But because of the wedding the church was dressed for it and that gave it an extra touch. The interior is beautiful with lots of gold. It's a bit bigger than its neighbour but",
          "Really unique church with all its gold. Definitely worth a short visit. It is a small church, so it won't take you a long time to visite. Combine is with the church next to it and you get a discount on the entrance fee.",
          "The church Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio or Martorana is one of the Palermo's wanders - it is a perfect open-air presentation of sicilian's cultural mixture, of Arabic, Norman and rennaisance Cristian Europe, carved into its Medieval stones. Definetely a must-see. It is in the old",
          "we didn't go inside, but from the outside and amongst its local environment, it has a really impressive presence. its also a lovely area to walk around and soak up what is a very local experience.",
          "I found this church through Trip Advisor; it is well worth a visit. I cannot but agree with the otrher reviewers here. Stunning splendour ...",
          "Sicily has a few must-see sites, including four churches with brilliant mosaics. This is one of them (the others are Capella Palatina, Monreale and Cefalu). DO NOT MISS THEM. They are simply dazzling. If you liked San Marco in Venice and Ravenna, you will be happy you saw",
          "The workmanship is amazing and the total effect astonishing. Almost every surface is covered in mosaics, paintings, tiles and gold. All of that said, we have seen other churches in Italy, Malta and Greece that while not identical are similar in opulence and workmanship. What is",
          "This church established in 1143 is an amazing feat of early Greek Byzantine mosaics with later paintings. It is over powering on first viewing but needs careful inspection to appreciate the workmanship. Christ the Pantocrator is magnificent. A small fee to enter and we bought",
          "Visit this church and then the little ex-church next door - great contrast both worth seeing. Sa. Maria is decorated elaborately with many mosaics. You have to pay about 2 euros to enter, but get a discount on the entry cost of the neighbouring very early church.",
          "A fine Norman building, with some great original mosaics - The main part of the church has had the mosaics replaced by paintings (a shame historically, but it has produced an interesting mix of art which in my opinion blends well). The later ceiling paintings show scenes from",
          "Pretty church. Is a mix of cultures, mix of styles and arts. But as a whole is excellent. Definitively a must in Palermo..",
          "A very small church near by other known sights. Inside the church you ll have an very beautiful atmosphare with a lot of gold and old art works. Its nice and relaxed there. The entry fee is 2 EUR and absolutely worth. The give you also cloth to cover your shoulder.",
          "The church Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, commonly called Martorana, is the most splendid example of syncretism elements of different religions, cultures and eras! It features a lovely mosaic iconography and decoration and the architecture is an excellent example of Byzantine,",
          "This church is amazing. There are frescoes and mosaics, the d\u00e9cor is extremely rich. It is definitely worth a visit. Ticket is cheap, there is student discount. If you visit the Oratorio of San Lorenzo you will get a discount on this church.",
          "We stopped by this place when we were walking around at night. Don't know much about it but it's very VERY old and probably has some good history if that sort of thing interest's you.",
          "I visited here after seeing it was the number one of things to do in Palermo on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed. Easy enough to find, we walked from the port in about 25 minutes. It costs only a couple of euros and is well worth it. The mosaics and art are stunning.",
          "This church is stunningly beautiful both in architecture and for its registers of mosaics. It is a must before you do the Capella Palatina or Monreale and to appreciate the sheer scale my advice would be here first, then Capella Palatina then Monreale. The church is beautiful",
          "This was my favourite church in Palermo, small and beautiful with exquisite mosaics inside. I would love to go back if I could.",
          "This small 12 cent Church is a real gem in the very city center, round the corner of the City Hall. First, it's dual facade. Apart from the Norman style which dominates the exterior, there's a part of facade in Baroque added in the 16 cent. Inside, again dual decorations.",
          "Loved this church as, like in the food, is a missmash of styles but all come together beautifully. The church follows a greek cross plan, but you can see the arabic influences particularly on exterior. The inside is small but stunning and dominated by a series of 12th century",
          "Lovely interior with large areas of the walls covered in medieval mosaics - a must-see if you are into medieval art",
          "This church is definitely an awe inspiring church. The ceiling and walls are covered with the most beautiful mosaics with images of Jesus Christ, Saint Mary and other saints. As you enter the church, the impact upon your eyes and mind is such, you just do not know where to",
          "The memorial chapel of Roger II's admiral is notable for the brilliant portrait mosaic of Roger II just inside the front door. For that alone it is worth a detour.",
          "This is a small gem of a church in a secluded corner of the Piazza Bellini. So many interconnecting archways give a magical appearance. They are covered with beautiful Byzantine mosaics. The cool blue colors were even more beautiful to me than the gold appearance of the Palatine",
          "If you only do one church in Palermo, try to make it this one that covers history, architecture, art and has a natural beauty of paintings, mosaics, marble and artistry. It's huge, with crypts on the bottom and the best view looking over the city, with great vistas from its",
          "La Martorana is is the most charming of Palermo's churches in that it reveals splendid layers of history which unfold before your eyes as you leave the glare of the hot Palermo sun and adjust to the interior lighting of this jewel of a church. This is one of Palermo's 'must see'",
          "This is a beautiful little church. The altar is really lovely. It's the ceiling of the church that dominates though. Every inch of it is beautifully decorated. Worth seeing.",
          "At \u20ac2 per adult to visit the interior of the church it is well worth a visit. Yet again I was in awe of the exquisite decoration of the churches here in Palermo. Just beautiful.",
          "This is worth doing if u attend other Christians services...the orthodox blessing is the mirror image of the Roman rite...for sure we saw the magnificent ceiling at length and for free...a multi sensory experience to say the least...plenty of Frankincense...is this full",
          "I got a taxi from mondello to the church at 9 on a Saturday morning & I had read previous reviews & was not disappointed. The church is utterly beautiful & with the sun coming through the centre it creates a very special feeling. I spent 20 mins just enjoying the ambience",
          "There are 5 monuments in Sicily with the same characteristics and belong in a unique architectural style. The Norman Arabic! UNESCO included those monuments in its list! The point that make them special is: The combination of Norman (baroque) style, with byzantine style and",
          "As you walk into this church (one of the very many in Palermo......they are truly everywhere) you fall silent. The beauty of the mosaics (earlier Byzantine than in Monreale) is stunning. As is the contrast between the outside and the interior of course (in common with many a",
          "Finely done golden mosaics, which light up a church when the light is right are hard to find. These are beauties, and can be enjoyed in their own right, set in among the baroque alterations. It's a very lucky thing they were preserved. There is much else to catch the eye in the",
          "A gorgeous church whose mosaics bring to life all the figures, Biblical and historical, they signify. Minimal number of tourists and tours, so there's the opportunity to view interior in peace and for as long as you like. Gold!",
          "What a surprise when you enter this building. Beautiful frescoes adorn walls and ceiling in this beautiful church. Takes your breath away. Well worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful sanctuary with outstanding mosiacs and a wonderful architectural history exhibiting the Norman period.",
          "In the larger church on the left, the internal decoration is fabulous. Stunning. It is worth spending an hour looking at the details on the wals. It is so over the top as to be very beautiful.",
          "Ok this is the tip to do it. San Cataldo il next door if you do them together is great or if you want to do one and not the other, it must be this one. However do it before C. Palatina as it is similar in style and less rich, but still very beautiful, close by is Ballaro market",
          "It may not be Palatine Chapel but it is still stunningly beautiful. So far I am concerned you cannot miss La Martorana if you are in Palermo. The church is not big but the interior is gorgeous. There is a small entry fee and photography is allowed so long no flash is being used.",
          "Small jewel of Arab Norman architecture with beautiful mosaics of Byzantine Arab influence.located in the city center but with odd visiting hours.do not miss the adjoining church,with the red cupolas the San Cataldo, belonging to the order of the holy grave of Jerusalem",
          "The Arab traveller, Ibn Jubayr, visited this church in 1184. He described it as \"the most beautiful monument in the world\". He may well be right, but a lot of water has flown under the bridge since his time. At first, we didn't know whether to feel overawed, enchanted or aghast",
          "This is another church that has wonderful mosaics, unfortunately much of the original was destroyed by a sect of aesthetically challenged Benedictine nuns in 1433 who extended the church and replaced a lot of superb Byzantine decoration with gaudy, tasteless, baroque",
          "I am glad I went here before the Palatine chapel and the Monreale cathedral, both of which overshadowed it in my memory. Two particularly good mosaics near the entrance. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Palermo",
          "Pleasant church set near the centre of town, worth a look but nothing special of note. Some of the architecture is interesting.",
          "The Arabo-Norman architecture of Sicily is deservedly famous for its multiple influences: Moorish, Byzantine and what the Normans brought from France. This church was endowed by a famous Greek admiral in the employ of Norman kings. Wonderful, glittering mosaics at one end and",
          "You won't find a blank piece of wall in this rather attractive Baroque church, go take a look if you are in Palermo.",
          "Worth the money and time to visit this beautiful church in the center of Palermo (near Quattro Cantti).",
          "The mosaics and paintings are very well preserved a great visit if you like history. The church is behind an older church & has a tall tower at the entrance",

          "Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio is better known as La Martorana. It continues to be used as a church and shares the platform with the Chiesa di San Cataldo. The bell tower is 12C but the fa\u00e7ade was originally Norman but renovated in baroque style. The small portico protects the",
          "This church has wonderful early mosaics probably from Greek crafts people. The church is in use as achurch so visiting needs to be planned.",
          "If you love Mosaics....well you are going to see this site anyway. Other parts of Italy and Sicily are treasure troves for this art form. Bring a pair of binoculars as you travel around Sicily, they will come in handy, especially inside the many churches that are covered with",
          "This very old church features yet more of the mosaics so famously used at Cefal\u00fa, Monreale, and the Cappella Palatina. Parts of the interior were baroque-ized, but that only adds to the sense of a long history; the tower retains its medieval air. The church is immediately",
          "This is the most nicest church in Palermo. This take a seat and be amazed bij the barok and the golden moza\u00efek. Definately worth it.",
          "We visited on a Monday and there were 2 weddings taking place. What a beautiful experience. There is a nice pizza restaurant on plaza Bellini in front of the church for people watching.",
          "One of the top sites in the city. Beautiful arabic- normand architecture, fantastic byzantine mosaics-- it's nice to see it before the cathedral and other top sites, and it's well worth the time for the visit.",
          "really beautiful, you should consider coming in if you like bizantine/baroque art - it's an interesting combination.",
          "We visited a lot of churches in Sicily but this was the most beautiful. While we were there there was an art class going on so it was interesting to see the various drawings of the mosaic figures. I really enjoyed my visit.",
          "Special place, close to another turistics points. The church closes during a part of the day, get inforation about the timetable.",
          "This interior incurs a charge for entrance. It is right next door to the sweet church of San Cataldo. The mosaics in the apsidal end are good but then then later representations take over to complete the rest of the church.",
          "This church is fascinating and beautiful - half of it is byzantine mosaics, and the other half is baroque paintings, giving it a strange fusion of styles",
          "The building is stunning from the outside but it was closed so we didn't go inside. The streets around are nice for walking and enjoying the architecture .",
          "We walked to this church while in port on a Mediterranean cruise. The outside of the church is simply stunning. I would have given a higher rating, but the church is currently closed so we could not go inside. I imagine it is truly beautiful inside though.",
          "This historic and beautiful church is the location of the Byzantine Rite community in Palermo. Beautiful Services - especially at Pascqua.",

          "Sometimes we should remember how close have been the Christian and the Muslim Culture ( Thought for both culture holders). In Sicily We know very well by Centuries. Just a few word. To show is better than explain. Go to the Martorana Church to understand it. So simple so great.",
          "The slighter younger sister of the neighbouring church, admire the construction and the mix of architecture.",
          "We went in, but there was a mass on, so it was closed for tourists. I took a couple of sneaky photos, but unfortunately we couldn\u2019t see the whole church. It would have been helpful to have a schedule posted near the door, to know when we could come back. I asked an official",
          "Even though small, a very impressive gem of history in Palermo. Friendly helpful staff! The entrance ticket gives discount to visit the neighboring church (Amiraglio Church).",
          "This church was very beautiful, and worth the $1.00 Euro entry fee. I just wish we'd had more time to spend there. The interior of the church is amazing. We were with a tour group, so did not experience any problems with the door lady!",
          "One of these is stunning and very beautiful it's the one on the left as you look into the entries from the Piazza. The other is much more expensive and is privately owned and is very plain but interesting because of the domes. The two are an easy stroll from central station",
          "And 'one of the most interesting and fascinating Palermo, a treasure trove of art works of various periods in history, but also full of beautiful mosaics, among which stands out that of the dome depicting Christ Pantocrator. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "you pay two euro. Can't remember which but I think the ticket allows you in elsewhere. fabulous mosaics",
          "The ticket costs 2 Euro, but do not hesitate to go in! It was one of the best church we have seen with the mixture between Byzantine and Barouque.",

          "This church is a jem in Palermo (a city of many, many jems) Byzantine mosaics are incredible. The church of St. Cataldo next door is also worth a visit.",
          "You must go to see the interiors here. The mosaics are gorgeous, I could not get enough. It is not as spectacular as the other, kingly churches you will see in Palermo, but you can get closer.",
          "A small little jewel of a church, in which different styles are skillfully mixed, as if each epoch kept adding pieces to the building.",
          "Astonishing Byzantine mosaic in a greek-ortodox church. The Byzantine mosaic cealing alone does worth the visit!",
          "The other 1 star reviews for this church were just cross that it was closed when they tried to visit - rather like reviewing a west end show on its day off! - So the Church itself was pretty impressive, although not nearly as striking as San Francesco of Assisi around the",
          "Again just the exterior of this extensive building.. There were some very shabby buildings in this city but this wasn't one of them",
          "Sicilian friends recommended that I see this place. I happened to enter on Christmas day, just as mass was beginning. Had never seen a Byzantine rite service. Much incense, elaborate vestments. Very interesting. Spectacular gold mosaics, equal to Monreale or Cappella Palatina.",
          "Not to be missed. Can combine, on foot with Balkaro quarter, to see the colourful food market. La Martorana is beautiful. Take time and photos! Not far is the Ballaro food market.",

          "One of many churches at or by the Quattro Conti - it's beautiful and if you're about churches, should not be missed! Took us aback with it's breathtaking Byzantine interior (baroque also) - the mosaic art work was unbelievable! It was started in the early 12th century - 1143ish",
          "If you have seen beautiful churches in Rome, then this is small in comparison. Yes, its very pretty and the workmanship beautiful, but not as overwhelming as I have seen elsewhere. Certainly worth a look when in Palermo though. I'm no historian of architecture or artistic",
          "Although the Cappella Palantine and Monreale are larger and have more mosaics, this small church is our favorite...it has such an interesting mix of Norman and Baroque, mosaics and frescos...and even arab-inspired designs on the lower walls. We visited it once with our tour",
          "Sicily is full of astounding churches, but this one should be near the top of your list. The medieval mosaics are breathtaking, and include the only known image of Roger II of Sicily, being crowned.",
          "Our tour guide took us to this beautiful small church, with it's stunning interior. The Byzantine mosaics are extremely well preserved and very intricate.",
          "Striking mosaics in the 12th century La Martorana prepares you for Capella Palatino and Monreale Duomo... How beautifully restored they are... Amazing art! The Baroque fa\u00e7ade with the Romanesque belltower and Byzantine dome gracefully blend together without being even a bit",
          "La Martorana, in the heart of historic Palermo, was brilliantly restored in 2012. While the exterior is striking, the interior is truly stunning - a unique mix of Norman mosaic and baroque. Take your time to explore this extraordinary visual feast!",
          "DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE if you are in Palermo -- it has some of the most amazing mosaics we've seen anywhere, and the place is small enough that you could actually see them. Often, you are in a gigantic church with high ceilings and you need binoculars to see and appreciate the",
          "I attended a wedding there, and the whole church was amazing inside more so than outside. It is very well worth the visit.",
          "almost a small Monreale. excellent visit. well worth it. take 10 minutes to have a look inside. next to another church you must see",
          "The church is richly decorated with mosaics all around and marble floors and columns, makes great contrast to the church next door - San Cataldo, which is typical example of the Arab-Norman architecture, which is unique to Sicily. I would say a few churches we visited in Palermo",
          "I went to the church twice, as the first time it was closed for the noon break. The second time we arrived at the same time as a bride in her Rolls Royce. We were not able to roam freely in the small church, but what we saw was awesome. It is full of golden mosaics.",
          "Must be seen Walking distance from downtown and historical sights. Don't drive there if you have a car. It is very difficult to find a parking space",
          "Incredible breathtaking church, with rich decorations of the golden ceilings, and amazing marble floors. An incredible lapizlasuli altar that completes the wonderful sight.",
          "lovely church so much gold in their beautiful church went on a sunday morning and was too busy with lots of tourists",
          "A high point and must see for the Byzantine mosaics. A guide would be helpful,but guide books specific to the site can be purchased there.",
          "The church is in the middle of town and near the information office. Entrance is euro 2 and well worth a visit. The bell tower is original from the 12th century. The facade looked to be a baroque renovation. Glittering Byzantine mosaics from cover the interior and around the",
          "You enter the church by the bell tower and you will be overwhelmed by the baroque interior, decorated with stuccoes and amazingly beautiful mosaics. I have never seen such religious splendour. The Byzantine dome and the mosaics are of exceptional interest with Christ",
          "I loved the gold Mosaic work in this small church which sits in the downtown area. Entrance is 2 Euro. I spent about 10 minutes here before I walked on to the many monuments in the same area.",
          "Great mosaics here..very accessible.Paintings on ceilings and metal screens at back of church are also impressive.very pretty church.",
          "A fantastic church with wonderful art and architecture, but not in the top 3 for churches in Palermo in our opinion, a bit too highly rated on trip advisor. Overall, a nice, cheap, easy to see attraction though.",
          "Beautifull church with fantastic greek mosaics. But a lot of the mosaics have been replaced with terrible baroque ornementations.",
          "A beautiful church which reveals the impact of history with it's changing architectural forms ranging from byzantine, to gothic, to renaissance. Byzantine mosaics in particular are magnificent.",
          "This church has the most amazing artwork covering its walls and is a combination of architecture from multiple civilizations.",

          "Beautiful, historic 11th century church in the heart of Palermo. A real gem. Not handicapped accessible.",
          "La Martorana is a well hidden gem that truly amazed us. If it was not for the proprietor of La Bella Vista, we would probably not have seen this jewel. While not as elaborate, regal and of the grand scale as Capella Palastina, Palermo, it's mosaic and architecture is",

          "The Inside is really something astonishing as the ceilings are part Byzantine, part Renaissance style. The architecture remains Byzantine. The Church is just behind the city hall, therefore very central.",
          "Must see in Palermo if you enjoy the beauty of the old churches' architecture and excellent mosaic. This one goes back to Byzantine times. Don't leave Piazza Bellini too soon. There are plenty to see and enjoy nearby",
          "When they talk about Arab-Norman Palermo this is one of the cathedrals they are talking about. It is unique to anything that I have seen before. You must go inside and pay the 3 euros to see for yourself. It is worth it. It was newly minted on the UNESCO world heritage list.",
          "It's in such a nice area, tucked away. You come around the corner and see it, and it's so beautiful. Must see",
          "If I have to choose the one landmark to visit, this would be my choice. It is easy to miss it because of its dull and weary outside look, but the real treasure is its interior. The mosaic work alone is incredible and well worth the visit.",
          "The mosaic work inside the church is incredible. Be sure to ask for the audioguide, which is available in English at no extra charge. It's very well done and adds a lot to your visit.",
          "We were pleasantly surprised of this shrine church . The inside is very unique and spiritually uplifting for all . Don't miss the place and enjoy to view of the city below on your drive to/from the shrine.",
          "The main church is quite pretty, but there are a lot of very similar churches in Palermo with very similar decor etc. I think the main attraction is the old Arab Mosque which stands in the same grounds and has now been converted into a Catholic Church. However, aside from the",
          "Not to be missed. Full of history - and the only portrait of the man who built much of Palermo, Mon Reale, Palatine Chapel.",
          "Very charming church with all its marble, afrescos and norman-arab style. Must definitely be seen together with nearby desecrated San Cataldo. Quite a contrast!",
          "Thus building is lovely outside and stunning in. We visited in the afternoon and it was pleasently quiet. The mosaics are stunning with s gold backdrop and beautiful detailing of faces which look so real.",
          "This was our first viewing of mosaics in Palermo and we were really impressed (little did we know what was to come!) Situated in a lovely square alongside the chapel of San Cataldo. Obviously very popular with the locals for weddings as we saw two during our stay in town.",
          "The USP of this church is the Byzantine mosaic of King Roger receiving his crown from the church, an impressive statement of his conviction of his appointment by God as much as a need to impress his subjects with that knowledge. An annoying downside is that access to the church",

          "After our Street food tour on the last day of our vacation we walked to this church with another couple and entered at afternoon opening time (3:30 pm on Monday); it's a small but potent example of Sicilian mosaics, not overwhelming but beautiful; a 1 or 2 Euro entry fee does",
          "Our first church visited in Palermo and one of our favorites due to the Arabic influence of icons and domes. Gorgeous mosaics on the ceiling gave the church an exotic oriental feel.",

          "This church is pretty much as stunning as it can get. You find it in a wonderful square, from which you can already admire its beutiful norman facade, with an impressive bell tower. Then you go in, and you have a series of wonderful frescoes, followed by amazing byzantine",
          "The guide says there is a charge to visit this church but I just went in one day and no one was around. the church has some great frescoes and shows once again a mixture of Arabic and European architectural elements. The baroque facade seems to have been added at a later date.",
          "The church was commenced in the 10th century and has been altered over the centuries by various people and groups. The final stunning church is the product of these people and the various cultures and should not be missed. Entry is best in the morning, whilst the crowds are",
          "The outside is interesting, with its mix of architectural styles but the incredible gold mosaics inside make this a sight to remember forever. This ornate church stands out in a country which has thousands and thousands of churches.",

          "There are many free churches in Palermo that are great. This is probably the best one you can pay for, and it's still just 2 euro (way better than St. Cataldo beside it, which I do not recommend). It showcases a combination of many different styles of architecture.",

          "The belltower of this church is beautiful and classic arab-norman architecture. The interior contains mosaics which are ancient. Unfortunately, during the Baroque period a nun tore down most of the ancient mosaics and redesigned the cathedral in Baroque style. Sometimes",

          "The inside of this church is utterly amazing with the mosaic work. There is very delicate mosaic work that depicts folded/draped fabric that is truly a sight to behold. An example can be seen in one of the photos I have attached, what appears to be a drape of some sort behind",
          "Interesting church with beautiful mosaics. Deceiving from the outside. Worth a visit. Smaller than most and very intimate.",

          "Incredibly beautiful! A church in which you see different styles in a single place. (frescoes, mosaics, columns/arches, etc). Very different from San Cataldo located right next door. Worth going to. Highly recommended.",
          "Chiesa di Santa Maria dell-Ammiraglio (La Martorana) is beautiful, awe-inspiring, full of wonder. Originally commissioned in 1143AD, the church is a jewel of frescoes, unbelievable mosaic, inlaid stone, columns, and arches. With San Cataldo (the three red domes) located right",

        "wiki": "Palermo Cathedral is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palermo, located in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy. It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. As an architectural complex, it is characterized by the presence of different styles, due to a long history of additions, alterations and restorations, the last of which occurred in the 18th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe church was erected in 1185 by Walter Ophamil (or Walter of the Mill), the Anglo-Norman archbishop of Palermo and King William II's minister, on the area of an earlier Byzantine basilica.   By all accounts this earlier church was founded by Pope Gregory I and was later turned into a mosque by the Saracens after their conquest of the city in the 9th century. Ophamil is buried in a sarcophagus in the church's crypt. The medieval edifice had a basilica plan with three apses, of which only some minor architectural elements survive today.\nThe upper orders of the corner towers were built between the 14th and the 15th centuries, while in the early Renaissance period the southern porch was added. The present neoclassical appearance dates from the work carried out over the two decades 1781  to 1801, supervised by Ferdinando Fuga and Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia. During this period the great retable by Gagini, decorated with statues, friezes and reliefs, was destroyed and the sculptures moved to different parts of the basilica. Also by Fuga are the great dome emerging from the main body of the building, and the smaller domes covering the aisles' ceilings.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe western entrance is on the current Via Matteo Bonello, and has the appearance set in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is flanked by two towers and has a Gothic portal surmounted by a niche with a precious 15th-century Madonna. Two lintelled ogival arcades, stepping over the street, connect the western fa\u00e7ade to the bell tower, which is annexed to the Archbishops Palace (now Museo Diocesano). This has a squared appearance adorned in the upper part by a fine crown of smaller belfries and small arcades.\nThe south side has outstretching turrets and a wide portico (the current main entrance) in Gothic-Catalan style, with three arcades, erected around 1465 and opening to the square. The first column on the left belonged to the original basilica and the subsequent mosque, as testified by the Qur'an verse carved on it. The carved portal of this entrance was executed in the period 1426 to 1430 by Antonio Gambara, while the magnificent wooden leaves are by Francesco Miranda (1432). The mosaic portraying the Madonna is from the 13th century, while the two monuments on the walls, works of the early 18th century, represents King Charles III of Bourbon and Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, both of which were crowned here, the latter with his wife Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans in December 1713.\nThe area of the apse, enclosed by the turrets and grandly decorated on the external walls, is part of the original 12th-century building, while the more modern part of the church is the left side, which has an early 16th-century portal by Antonello Gagini. The South-Western fa\u00e7ade, looking at the Archbishop Palace, dates from the 14th to 15th centuries.\n\nThe interior has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles divided by pilasters. In the first two chapels of the right aisle are the tomb of emperors and royal figures moved here in the 18th century from their original sites (mostly from the basilica itself). Here are the remains of Emperor Henry VI, his son Frederick II, as well as those of Peter II of Sicily. A Roman sarcophagus is the tomb of Constance of Aragon, Frederick's wife. Under the mosaic baldachins are the tombs of Roger II, the first King of Sicily, and his daughter Constance. The last two were once located in the transept of the Cathedral of Cefal\u00f9.\n\nThe Sacrament chapel, at the end of the left aisles, is decorated with precious stones and lapislazuli. To the right, in the presbytery, is the chapel of Saint Rosalia, patron of Palermo, closed by a richly ornamental bronze gate, with relics and a 17th-century silver urn which is object of particular devotion.\n\nThe 1466 Gothic-Catalan style wooden choir and the marble remains of the Gagini's retable (removed during the 18th-century alterations) are also precious, as well as a marble statue of the Madonna with Child by Francesco Laurana and pupils (1469), a 13th-century polychrome Crucifix by Manfredi Chiaramonte, the holy water stoup on the fourth pilaster (by Domenico Gagini) and the Madonna della Scala by Antonello Gagini, on the high altar of the new sacristy. The Relics Chapel contains the relics of St. Christina, St. Ninfa, St. Cosma, St. Agatha and St. Mamilianus, first patron of Palermo.\n\nThe crypt, accessed from the left side, is an evocative room with cross vault supported by granite columns, housing tombs and sarcophagi of Roman, Byzantine and Norman ages. People buried here include archbishops Walter Ophamil, the church's founder, and Giovanni Patern\u00f2, patron of Antonello Gagini who sculpted the image on his tomb.\nThe Cathedral Treasury contains goblets, vestments, monstrances, a 14th-century breviary and the famous Crown of Constance of Sicily, a golden tiara found in her tomb in 1491.\nThe Cathedral has a meridian, which may be considered as an earlier  type of heliometer (solar \"observatory\"), one of a number constructed in Italian churches, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries. This one was built in 1801 by the famous astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, the director of the Observatory of Palermo who discovered the first minor planet or asteroid, Ceres.  The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor ).  There is a bronze line, la meridiana on the floor, running precisely N/S.  At solar noon (circa 12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer), the sun image passes through this line. At different times of the year the passage occurs at different point of the line. The ends of the line mark the positions at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show various dates throughout the year.\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of time and the calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24-hour) day was measured from the moment of sun-rise, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to know when the Vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter. On the belltowers there were six medieval bells. \nThe instrument could be used for research on the apparent movements of the Sun, including its relative distance from the Earth, measured through the size of the floor projected solar disk, and even to compare the results with Ptolemaic and Copernician predictions.\n\n\n== 17th and 19th century renovations ==\nThe church is composed of different styles, as in the following centuries it underwent various changes. \nThe last was at the end of the 18th century, when it radically remade the interior designed by Ferdinando Fuga.\nIn 1767, the archbishop Filangieri had entrusted to Ferdinand the restoration of the building. The work began only in 1781, carried out not by Ferdinand but by Palermitan Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia and lasted until the 19th century.\nThe reworkings by Marvuglia were in reality much more invasive and radical than the projects of the Florentine architect, who thought instead of keeping, at least in part, the complex of longitudinal aisles and the original wooden ceiling.\nThe restoration intervened to change the original appearance of the complex, providing the church of the characteristic but discordant dome, performed according to the designs of Ferdinando Fuga.A second font was added in 1797, by Fillipo and Gaetano Pennino. It is supported by sculptures depicting the Tree of Knowledge and Adam and Eve. This font is the subject of a poem by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, which was published posthumously in 1840.\n\n\n== Royal and Imperial burials ==\nIn the right aisle, in the first and second chapel communicating with one another, are the monumental tombs of King Roger II, his daughter Queen Constance I of Sicily, her husband Emperor Henry VI, and their son Emperor Frederick II, as well as the burials of Frederick's first wife Constance of Aragon and his great-great-grandson William II, Duke of Athens on the side walls. The four main sarcophagi, all in porphyry, form a group that also includes that of William I of Sicily in Monreale Cathedral. They \"are the very first examples of medieval free-standing secular tombs in the West, and therefore play a unique role within the history of Italian sepulchral art (earlier and later tombs are adjacent to, and dependent on walls).\"  It is likely that the four sarcophagi of William I (in Monreale), Constance, Henry and Frederick were carved by a local Sicilian workshop from a single Roman column shaft, possibly from the Baths of Caracalla or the Baths of Diocletian in Rome. They ostensibly took inspiration from the porphyry sarcophagi of late Roman Emperors that were still visible in the 12th century in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, including those of Constantine the Great and his successors up to Marcian as described by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the De Ceremoniis, four of which now stand in front of the \u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums' main building.The sarcophagus of Frederick II is surmounted by a canopy with porphyry columns and the urn is supported by two pairs of lions, together with those of Frederick II were also preserved the remains of Peter II of Sicily. \nOdo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror, was buried in the cathedral in 1097. Aside from burials, Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy and Charles III of Spain were crowned in the cathedral.\n\n\n== The treasure of the cathedral ==\n\nThe \"treasure of the cathedral\", which is composed of sacred vestments from the 16th and 18th centuries, frontals, monstrances, chalices, a breviary with miniatures of the 15th century and the gold tiara of Constance of Aragon. Other precious objects, enamels, embroidery and jewelry, are exposed in central message boards such as for example the breviary parchment of the 1452 coat of arms with an Archbishop Simon from Bologna.\nThe system of bells currently mounted is composed of eight elements assembled with the Ambrosian.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nArab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nParadoxplace Photos of Palermo Cathedral",

          "This was a last minute add to our agenda and we are so glad we did. What a spectacular church. The audio guide was thorough and well worth the couple euros. Make sure to also go up along the rooftop to get a beautiful view. Make sure to have this site on your itinerary.",
          "We went with a group from our hotel in Palermo since we had a large enough group. You can also take a city bus from Palermo for a nominal fee. We hired a guide for the time we spent there. The Duomo and the adjacent Cloisters are something to see. Beautiful mosaics exhibiting",

          "This is the treasure of Sicily and very special indeed. Even if you\u2019ve been to Ravenna and seen this style before, you mustn\u2019t miss it. When you take into account the age of the Cathedral the wow becomes even bigger. Even if you don\u2019t like visiting churches still go. Monreale",

          "The building is amazing. Well known for all mosaic inside. But also the roof and the museum is worth to see. 10 Euro for both together. Unfortunately not so much time for the museum because it opens at 3 p.m. and close already at 5 p.m.",
          "It\u2019s really hard to describe the beauty inside this church. It clearly took many years of devoted craftsmen to complete this cathedral. Probably the most amazing church we\u2019ve seen in Sicily. Worth going out of your way to see. Note that the parking before town can be tricky",
          "Endured an uncomfortably overcrowded and seemingly interminable bus ride to Monreale after waiting an hour at Piazza Indipendenza Palermo.30 stops!!.More and more bodies squeezing on.Hardly anyone getting off!!.BUT ultimately it was worth it- both for the view looking back",
          "Craving for a breathtaking duomo, a view on Palermo and a cute village with narrow streets? Go to Monreale. What you will find are a gorgeous church, gardens, piazza, and shops. My personal highlight was garden giving a view on Palermo. It\u2019s easy to reach by bus from Palermo",
          "We visited the main church which was open to the public for free. Opted not to take the other part of the church that has an entrance fee but a lot of tourist were going. The church interior is indeed beautiful. Do not forget to see the rest of the town. Which I think is",

          "We spent a lovely afternoon in Monreale, mostly exploring the Duomo and its cloisters. Its quite plain exterior hides a simply stunning interior - I have never seen so much gold in the outstanding mosaics which cover most of the walls. Everywhere you look, there is something new",
          "Came to Monreale to escape the hustle and bustle of Palermo and I\u2019d highly recommend it. Our group decided to go on the full tour within the cathedral and it\u2019s power and beauty is simply breathtaking.

          "On our way from Cefalu to Mondello we stopped at Monreale to see the cathedral. For those driving, keep in mind that there is a really close parking lot, just 10 minutes away from the cathedral, called Duomo parking. Keep in mind that the cathedral closes around noon. We arrived",

          "Our tour bus brought us here early morning before the crowds were a problem. The cathedral built in the 12th century of Norman architecture is simply amazing. It is a mixture of Eastern Rite and Roman Catholic. The ceiling has the most beautiful gleaming gold mosaics. Starting",

          "Having seen articles on the Duomo in travel magazines, it was on our to-do list in Palermo. We caught the 389 bus from Indepenzia, it was crowded, but gave a close-up view of the Sicilian approach to parking. Double is common, triple occurs on occasions!!! The trip is worth it,",
          "Monreale is an easy (but can be very crowded) service 389 bus journey from Palermo Indipendenza, price 1.40\u20ac single. The Duomo itself is stunning, with 3 levels of mosaics, covering the creation, the Book of Genesis, and the life of Christ. What is most intriguing is that the",
          "Is it worth a detour? Yes. Is it worth a special trip? Most definitely even if to get there, you have to brave the horrendous traffic and driving in Palermo. Regardless of whether you are an afficionado of churches and cathedrals, this is one of the most striking. However as",
          "After two weeks of visiting countless churches, I was not expecting much but I was completely blown away by the grandeur and history present here. It is one of the greatest examples of Normal architecture anywhere! The architectural design elements are way beyond other",

          "Caught the bus from Palermo - the fountains on the way up - the views - the Cathedral - views from the roof - the abbey - it is a half day to day trip (they close mid day for a couple of hours) well worth taking",
          "I have been in many cathedrals in my time-both catholic and protestant-but this beats them all! The mosaics are inspirational and breathtaking telling many biblical stories from both Old and New Testaments. If you have travelled by train to Palermo, it is relatively easy to get",
          "The cathedral will take your breath away when you enter it. Entrance to the main building is free. Very beautiful inside. After this you can pay to go into the cloisters which is also very calming and beautiful",

          "A stunning example of Norman architecture , beautiful mosaics , take a pair of binoculars makes it a bit easier to pick out the detail. Pay the extra to climb the stairs for great views of the city & countryside. The cloisters are tranquil & a pleasure to visit.",
          "Yes it really is mosaic. Incredible interior of the Duomo di Monreale is one of the hidden gems of Europe. Less frenetic than nearby Palermo, Monreale is a good location to explore the area and the Duomo is definitely not a place you\u2019ll want to miss. Take a seat and look up in",
          "We parked behind the cathedral and went around to the dome. The place is huge and totally impressive, through mosaic and sculptures. The entrance is free.",
          "Visited here on an excursion. Beautiful cathedral with really interesting architecture. The mosaics covering the walls are amazing and tell the stories of creation, old and new testaments. The only downside was the crowds of people. We didn't have time to visit the cloisters",
          "This cathedral is incredible, the architecture, history, mosaics, better than Ravenna, I thought. Tiny tiny mosaics with lifelike pictures. Noah's arch on the waves, the Garden of Eden, hard to take it all in. We drove without a problem, parking was a problem but we got lucky",
          "A must see place. The interior mosaics rival those of Ravenna If you are feeling fit a climb to the top is worth adding just for the views of the interior, the countryside and the cloisters which is also worth a visit",
          "This church is indeed incredible and worth seeing. However, don't let people convince you that you have to pay and pay and pay. admission into the main cathedral is FREE. an excellent audio guide is 5 Euros and the fee to get into the left side chapel (inside the cathedral)",

          "Well worth the drive up from Palermo. I had read about traffic jams and parking problems but we drove there easily from Mondello and straight into a car park with several friendly staff, 5 mins down the hill from the Duomo. We paid to go in and were awestruck by the highly",

          "The mosaics covering the interior of the building will blow you away. Recommend the rooftop \u2018terraces\u2019 walk and the Norman/Arabic cloister which both cost more but are worth it.",
          "We got the locals bus from Palermo to Monreale which is about 35 minute journey. Buses were crowded and hot couldn't squeeze another person on On arrival the Cathedral is absolutely stunning. Takes your breath away how ornate and beautiful the inlay, carvings and paintings",

          "The Duomo of Monreale is awesome. Built in the 12th century in less than 20 years, it is an amazing Norman structure built by William II. The inside is covered with mosaics which tell the story of both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Constructed when most people",
          "5 Miles or so from Palermo centre but well worth the trek - we were on an organised tour so that sweat was done for us. This cathedral and the one at Cefalu both have as the main centrepiece attraction an enormous mosaic of Christ, almost carbon copies and done by the same",
          "If there is a bigger or better collection of Byzantine style mosaic work somewhere else, I'd like to know. I don't understand the recent reviewer who visited and declared that he wouldn't remember them long. The entire inside surface of the walls are covered with brilliant,",
          "Monreale is very much the place to visit in this part of Sicily and as such the area around the Duomo and it's piazza are awash with the usual tourist trap tackiness and eateries good, bad and indifferent. The outside of the church is not particularly inspiring for a Norman",
          "Beware - the staff that we encountered outside the cathedral were absolutely vile. They are the 'clothes police', ensuring that visitors are appropriately dressed to enter. As a catholic family, we understand what is expected and have no problem with the requirements. However",
          "We took the AST bus from near Centrale. We had trouble locating it. It is on Piazza Giulio Cesare, turn right from Via Roma and in the middle of the vending machines is a small AST stand and the bus stop is in front of there. A man came to sell tickets about 10 minutes before",
          "You'd be hard pressed to find an undecorated surface in this gem of a cathedral. I don't think I've ever seen so much gold mosaic. Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",
          "Before I get to the truly amazing focus on the Duomo itself, I want to give valuable info on driving there. If you follow maps programs they take you in a way that drives you right past \"Monreale Duomo Parking.\" You'll be tempted to park there, as I and many others did, don't do",
          "The Duomo is nice, the staff outside is horrible. They are rude and they were laughing at some people. (Just because of the appearance) Go with shoulders, back and legs covered or you\u2019ll need to pay 1 euro (it doesn\u2019t say nothing on the website as they need to make money) but",

          "The Monreale Duomo experience was let down by 2 factors. One, public transport to monreale is dismal. Bus 389 comes only once every hour and we finally decided to take a taxi (20 euros from piazza independicenza). Two, while the main cathedral is not ticketed, the other areas",
          "Monreale is a very pleasant hilltop town with several squares surrounded by cafes and restaurants, but the Cathedrale is the standout feature. The Cathedrale di Monreale and cloisters are reckoned to be the finest buildings in Sicily \u2013 and I can believe it. The Cattedrale itself",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches we have seen in Europe. The mosaics art depicting the stories of the old and New Testament are rich in color and details. This is a must see for those travelers that like history and art.",

          "Most tour groups will go here because entrance to Monreale is free whereas there is a charge to enter the older Capella Palatine next to Palazzo Reale. It is worth going in order to see a different area of Palermo and views of Palermo from very high up. Get there early to",
          "We took an afternoon trip to Monreale from the centre of Palermo. Pretty good value - 30 euros each way by taxi. It's a lovely little town and the duomo exceeds expectations in every way. It's lovely inside with lots of gilt and mosaic and the climb to the tower is worth every",
          "Worth visiting Monreale for this cathedral alone. The mosaics inside are outstanding and worth spending more time to see it all if you can.",
          "This must be one of the beautiful cathedrals in the world. We had the good fortune of having a tour manager who gave us considerable information on the rich history of the building itself and explained the imagery It had magnificent mosaics - just stunning.",
          "Great atmosphere. Busy but well managed with quiet spaces if needed. The quality of the internal detail is exquisite and we really needed more time to absorb all the detail.",

          "Truly breathtaking. Even my cynical husband was impressed! Very much worth seeing. Adjacent Benedictine Cloister less awe-inspiring, tho still quite beautiful and worth seeing. Dont waste money on Cloister Audioguides. We rented 7 of them for our family-none of them worked",
          "The grandeur of this cathedral is overwhelming, especially due to its composition of mosaics. It is just amazing and has free admission to the main church. It is unique in the world and well worth the visit. Strongly suggest that you rent (5 Euro) the audio guide, so that you",

          "Duomo di Monreale did not disappoint. It is as glittery as it is interesting. However, don't wear shorts as you will be denied entry unless you pay 1 euro for a blue cover-up. I saw many a tourists getting flustered and many were caught unprepared. I don't blame them for being",

          "This must be one of the most beautiful buildings in Sicily. Astonishingly built in only a few years after inauguration in 1172 by William II, the cathedral is a masterpiece of 12th century art and architecture, with marble-patterned floors, marble walls at the lower level and",

          "We enjoyed seeing the mosaics,but we're a bit hampered as unfortunately there was a funeral going on at the time. There was a car rally in the main square and it was nice to sit in the square at the caf\u00e9 and watch the world go by.The mosaics are an amazing site,when you consider",
          "Bit of a struggle through Palermo traffic on our red hop on/off bus (definitely the best way to see Palermo and get to Monreale) but the Duomo and Cloisters are worth seeing, as is the view over Palermo. However, don't be oversold on it as you would struggle to fill 2 hours in",
          "I have seen the fantastic mosaics in ravenna and in palermo, but these beat everything, and are for me the most beautiful mosaics I have ever seen. Extremely stunning. You can see them without any cost, because the entrance to the church itself is free. You just need to pay for",
          "Definitively worth to visit! Beautifull cathedral, with impressive paintings. If you intend to go to the terraz (up), bear in mind it are very narrow corridor and stairways not designed for mass tourism. Unfortunately the way back is the same as the way up and you need to have",

          "Don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll have much to add to other reviews, other than to reiterate that this is a must see. The mosaics on the walls are so spectacular, that they shouldn\u2019t be missed. I listened in on a guided tour for a couple of minutes and wished that I had looked into that",
          "An absolute must if you are visiting Sicily. The walls inside this cathedral are covered in mosaics telling the story of the creation of the world, the old testament and the life of Christ. You'll need a map ( 1\u20ac ) to be able to follow the scenes. Really superb. The cloister is",
          "This was originally built in the 12th century during the Norman kingdom of Sicily. The Norman influence is still very strong. This is definitely worth a visit",
          "One of the best churches I\u2019ve seen! The mosaics are amazing...they are just so beautiful and awe-inspiring. Definitely not one to miss. I also highly recommend getting a ticket which includes Le Terrazze (rooftop walk) as well as the Cloisters. The climb isn\u2019t too difficult",

          "When in Palermo it must to see this stunning cathedral,with golden plated mosaics,representing images and scenes of Old Testament and New testament.You may get there by Hop on Hop off tourist bus.",
          "Must see, superb!! Byzantine masterpiece. Note, it closes at 1245 until 230. We also saw the cloisters, fantastic.",
          "The cathedral of Monreale is really beautiful. It is overwhelming to step into its beauty full of mosaics. Best thing is to sit downs and look around. With small kids, if raised with biblical stories, it is good fun to point out all the biblical stories in mosaic. Be careful",
          "The main church didn't open until 09:30, so went to see the collisters first of all. Pay extra for that, but worth seeing. They are being restored. The ceiling was worth seeing, the place was full of tourists which takes some of that away, but I guess this is what we all came to",
          "An incredible cathedral and fantastic inside, but for me, some of the churches in Palermo were better. Only a personal view but considering the mileage to get there, not my number one.",
          "Probably one of the most impressive churches you might visit. Whether Catholic or not, you may attend to the Sunday Mass at 10:30 am, all the mosaics are lit, the choir is singing in Latin and Italian, you let yourself be immersed in the beauty of the architecture and the",
          "It's certainly worth a visit, the mosaics are gorgeous. Entrance to the cathedral is free. Make sure you visit the cloister. It's \u20ac6 to enter.",
          "Nothing can quite prepare you for what you see when entering this cathedral. Others have already spoken of the history and background. So some practical information from me. If you drive there as we did, it is not well sign-posted. Our sat nav said we were at Monreale but no",
          "Yes, it is amazing. Just make sure you go a a bright sunny day so the gold tiles can be seen in their splendor. If you have a bit of extra time, spend a few euros and go up on the roof to overlook the gardens and enjoy an magnificent view of the city and gulf of Palermo. We",

          "So what do you do if you are the grandson of the founding Norman King of Sicily? Build a cathedral of course! And what a knock out number this is. Every square metre of ceilings and walls are bedecked with gilt, mosaic tiles, burgundy tincture, and lapis lazulae blue. Wonderful",
          "Build by William II, this cathedral and monastery was build in just 15 years to compete with the cathedral in Palermo. Beautiful stained glass windows depicting biblical stories, carved pillars with ancient Greek and Christian symbolism.",
          "From the car park it is a long climb up to the cathedral [you can take a taxi to the top]. The cathedral was founded in 1172 and is filled bottom to top with gold mosaics, it is absolutely breath taking. Stories from the Old Testament are depicted in mosaics. It is considered to",
          "I visited the Royal Palace Palatine Chapel earlier in the day, this was even better. The whole building including cloister and cathedral were amazing. Well worth the visit up the mountain. The whole town was very quaint and even though raining it was a very enjoyable experience.",
          "As others say well worth seeing. Travel on the 389 bus from near the Palazzo Reale/Palatine chapel, not very frequent and crowded, I suspect the service has been cut back. You can pay to climb up the inside above the nave and out the back with a spectacular view towards the sea.",
          "The mosaics inside the cathedral are amazing - the ceiling is completely covered. The entrance ticket for the cloister is a bit expensive and the museum not so interesting.",
          "Cloister was peaceful, serene; the Duomo - decorations of gold tesserae mosaics in Monreale Cathedral, designated UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage site \u2013 stunning, magnifient! The mosaics were made with 2200 kg of pure gold. Monreale, the cathedral and its cloister represent the largest",
          "The Duomo of Monreale is a riot of Norman / Arabic construction and decoration. It really is stunning inside. It also has William's sarcophagus - also unique. Make sure you look around the outside, as some of the Norman stonework is elaborately beautiful. If you can catch both",
          "The decoration of this cathedral is so rich, the glittering mosaics, the gold, and the stories that they portray are second to none. The inlaid stone floors are wonder. The mosaic patterns on the columns and walls are a marvel of painstaking effort. However, the newly renovated",

          "If you are in Palermo, a visit to Monreale is a must. The Duomo is the star attraction of this entire region. The mosaics tell the beautiful stories of the Old and New Testaments and you can buy a map for 1 euro to go along with the mosaics. After that we ate at a restaurant",

          "Definitely the main reason for going to Monreale. But if this is your last stop on your Sicilian tour, then it 'May\" not wow you as much after seeing so many other amazing Cathedrals. Luckily it was my first cathedral in Sicily! Also check out the narrow local lanes around the",
          "A must visit but not easily accessible by public transportation. The artistry of the mosaic work is beyond words. The mosaic covered the wall, and the ceiling depicting the stories in the Bible. The mosaic on the floor in the back part of the church provides a flavor of the work",
          "The cathedral is everything that people praise. This review is a note of caution. The bus that goes to Monreale is very infrequent, like every 1 1/2 hours. It is a very small bus that makes all local stops. On a February Monday, there was virtually not one inch of floor spce",
          "The Duomo presides over the centre of Monreale facing two open squares from its towers and terraces you get sweeping views across the town and surrounding countryside. Inside gleaming mosaics executed by Greek craftsmen are simply breathtaking with around 600,000 kilos of gold",
          "From the 1100's. Built in the Norman age by Muslims. Very moorish design. Upper church decorated by multi-cultural craftsmen. The mosaics are incredible. 92 stairs up from the parking area. Panoramic view of Palermo at the back end of the cathedral. A very wonderful sight",
          "Bit of a journey to get up there, but oh so worth it... The craftsmanship of the mosaics is breathtaking, as is the view. To be honest, it took so long to get there that my youngest wasn't as enthusiastic as I was to marvel at the mosaic art. Luckily, there was a variety of",
          "To behold the wonder of monument and mighty works of humble yet gifted men is endless joy. Such masterpieces built by the hands of someone's father, son or brother. All that laboured must have found peace in their lives and rest in their souls. They do not create beauty and",
          "OVERALL: A super-sized Palatina Chapel (Palermo Royal Palace) with great mosaic artistry. Outside, great hiltop views of Palermo. HELPFUL TIP: 1) BATHROOM is at the cafe across the courtyard. The Duomo does not have one. Buy a well-priced cappuccino and a little relief :-).",
          "Probably the second most beautiful thing I have seen in my life ! Don't leave Palermo without seeing it .It is about 6km away , you need to find transport or ask a guide , even better . Count at least an hour and half for the visit . Mosaics and beauty like you have never",
          "This is a MUST SEE attraction. Bring binoculars. Bring a zoom lens for your camera. Take time to savor the mosaic art. The quality, detail, beauty and amount of the mosaic art is overwhelming. We were lucky enough to attend an evening service where we had the time and quiet",

          "The Cathedral and Cloister are more than worth the trip to Monreale! You will find another a spectacular World Heritage site with mosaics like this only in Istanbul or of course here in Sicily. Incredible craftsmanship and overwhelmingly beautiful Cathedral.",
          "...but this was spectacular! It was hard to pull one's eyes away from the intricate and overpowering design throughout. I was especially taken by the border mosaics, each of which was in a different pattern and style. A photographer's dream.",
          "I have really never seen anything like this. It is the most fantastic church with the most beautiful story telling in gold etc. It is big. It is beautiful. It is extremely impressive. Not even the Saint Marcus in Venice is on this level.",

          "Well, I was stunned by the Palatine Chapel in Palermo, but this is something way bigger. And all covered in interesting art, making you wonder, how much time it took to build and decorate all this. Take your time, try to get information about the details (guide, guidebook).",

          "When you visit Palermo, you must see the Duomo. It is located in a quaint Sicilian town with a magnificent view of Palermo. It is difficult to get any distance to view the Duomo from the outside because it is closely surrounded by the town. The real gems are inside. Go inside",
          "The Cathedral in Monreale is easily the best church in entire Sicily. Ornate mosaics that depict scenes from the Creation, the deluge and other religiously significant moments adore the ceiling. Monreale is small and peaceful to walk around, so not limit yourself to Duomo, walk",

          "This in my opinion is a beautiful church on the same level as St. Peter's in Rome. There is so much beauty and history here that will blow you away, from the beautiful Doors, to the gold on the ceiling, to one of the most amazing Pianos. This visit I was able to travel up to",
          "I would recommend a tour it really does speed up the wait. It ws just amazing, the tour guide was very informative, we would have missed some of the fine points if we didn't have a guide. The walk up to the top of the dome was not my favorite but I stood in the doorway at the",

          "It was worth the short trip out of Palermo to see the cathedral in Monreale. The golden mosaics inside were spectacular and worth the visit alone. You can also get on the terrace although it was a bit narrow in some places. Not much else to see in the town and you could probably",

          "Our wonderful host (Giuseppe)at Palazzo Pantaleo where we stayed in Palermo arranged a taxi (fabulous driver, Tata) to take us to, wait, and take us back from this magnificent church. Because of this we were able to see much of Palermo we may have missed, and were able to enjoy",
          "If you visit Sicily, i strongly recommend going to this attraction. Firstly it is an amazing drive to Monreale from the west of the island with absolutely stunning scenery. Once there this place is gorgeous. Inside the mosaics and architecture is breath taking. A real must see",
          "It's true what everyone says. This church is unique. The mosaics on almost every surface of the church make it truely special. Unlike anything we have seen before. Take the drive up to Monreale, if traveling by car you will come to a carpark on the way up to the church. Park",
          "This was most definitely the highlight of our 7 day Sicily tour. I've never seen anything that comes close to this. I snapped nearly 500 photos of the Duomo's mosaic tiles. I didn't want to miss a thing. We were inside for over 2 hours & it seemed to fly by. I'll never forget",
          "On the outside this Duomo is not impressive but once inside the beautiful well preserved artwork is a sight to be seem. It is good to sit down and just take many of the intricate artworks. I went in late October and the Church is not crowded at all so I had a lot of time and",

          "When you first enter the Cathedral you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls, but they are not paintings they are golden mosaics. It is a very beautiful example for Byzantine art. It was called the church of the poor because all the Bible is represented on the walls",
          "This place blows you away. Sadly we were only able to stay for an hour but a week still wouldn't do it justice. The interior rivals anything you might see in St Petersburg or Rome. Beautiful, serene and stunning.",
          "We had visited before but during an Easter service. That was magical but this time we got the chance to look at the amazing interior in detail. The mosaics are definitely a feast for the eyes! We also visited the Cloisters (\u20ac6 entry fee), which were much quieter and amazing in",
          "I don't understand why I didn't love this cathedral. When we were there the light was low and the mosaics seemed a bit dull. While we could appreciate the amazing skill involved, they did not glow as we had expected. They seemed very stiff and formal. We had also popped into",

          "This cathedral is a gem. The mosaics, dating from the Norman period, cover almost every surface. All tell a story. My favorite was the story of Noah which runs all along one side of the nave. The cloisters are also beautiful, with mosaics incorporated into many columns. Each of",

          "On the way back from Cefalu to Trapani we made a detour to Monreale Cathedral (Duomo). And it was well worth it. This is a 12th Century Norman Catherdral, again huge. And on a very hot day wonderful to get some cool and some calm, despite the crowds.",
          "We've been to cathedrals all over Europe. Each has been beautiful in their own way, but Monreale was special. The mosaics there are so stunning and so expansive (60,000 square meters?) that you can't grasp them by seeing photos or reading about them. It was like seeing the",

          "I am not a huge aficionado of churches, but it is impossible not to be overwhelmed by the glorious interior of this thousand year old cathedral. The interior is so dazzling that it is possible to forget the soaring mass of the intricate Norman/Byzantine exterior as soon as you",
          "Wow - Palermo has two spectacular cathedrals with the Palatina and this one. Duomo di Monreale is certainly one of the most beautiful churches in world. The \u20ac6 to see the other parts including the museum and the views from the terrace was worth it. Check the hours before",
          "You should visit this duomo together with the Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio in Palermo because it allows you to compare the Byzantine mosaic style between the two. It's hard to choose between the two - this one is bigger and I'd say that because the Byzantine style is a bit later",
          "The church is exquisit! Amazing art work with some thousands of mosaic pieces. We spent good whole hour in there with our tour guide and he talked the whole time. It is a must-see place with so much history. Highly recommanded",

          "This is a must on your tour of the area. The interior is covered in intricate mosaics telling the story of the old and new testament. Truly wonderful even if you are not of the Christian faith. The workmanship is amazing. It would be advisable to get a guide to explain the the",

          "We've seen many Byzantine mosaics in Palermo, Rome and Ravenna, but the total effect in the duomo of Monreale cannot be beaten. The sophistication of the drawing,the virtuosity of the patterns, make it an experience not to be missed. And the side chapel that you pay for is worth",

        "wiki": "The Zisa is a castle in the western part of Palermo in Sicily, southern Italy. It is included in the UNESCO Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale World Heritage Site.The construction was begun in the 12th century by Arabian craftsmen for king William I of Sicily , and completed by his son William II.  The edifice had been conceived as summer residence for the Norman kings, as a part of the large hunting resort known as Genoardo (Arabic: Jannat al-ar\u1e0d, literally \"Earthly Paradise\") that included also the Cuba Sottana, the Cuba Soprana and the Uscibene palace.\nThe Zisa is clearly inspired by  Moorish architecture. The name Zisa itself derives from the Arab term al-Az\u012bz, meaning \"dear\" or \"splendid\". The same word, in Naskh script, is impressed in the entrance, according to the usual habit for the main Islamic edifices of the time.\n\nIn the 14th century merlons were added, by partly destroying the Arab inscription (in Kufic characters) which embellished the upper part of the edifice. More substantial modifications were introduced in the 17th century, when the Zisa, reduced to very poor conditions, was purchased by Giovanni di Sandoval e Platamone, Marquis of S. Giovanni la Mendola, Prince of Castelreale, Lord of the Mezzagrana and the Zisa. The latter's marble coat of arms with two lions can be seen over the entrance fornix. Several rooms of the interior were modified and others added on the ceiling, a great stair was built, as well as new external windows.\nFrom 1808 to the 1950s the building was used a residence by the princes Notarbartolo di Sciara. Acquired by the Region of Sicilia it was restored in the 90s (the Northern part had crumbled down in 1971 and has been rebuilt along the original lines). The Zisa today is opened to tourists. Some rooms house Islamic art pieces, tools and artifacts from the Mediterranean area. The most notable room is the central hall, with a mosaic decoration; once it had a fountain too, from which the water flowed outside. On 3 July 2015 it became UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nGiuseppe Bellafiore: La Zisa di Palermo, Flaccovio, Palermo, 1994.\nDonald Matthew: The Norman Kingdom of Sicily, Cambridge University Press, 1992.\nJohn Julius Norwich: The Normans in Sicily: The Normans in the South 1016-1130 and the Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194, Penguin, 1992.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources Used ==",

          "This building has an amazing past, and is now in very nice condition. A number of artifacts are displayed in the rooms, from the time of the building though not from this site. I loved the architecture and the setting. It is a bit far from other sites you may visit, but worth it.",
          "An amazing palace that combines the Moorish and Christian art. But Moorish is predominant. The fountains are wonderful as are the waterworks that take water from above through the building.",
          "Well worth the visit to see the way in which the Normans used Arab craftsmen from an earlier occupation of Palermo to build mosque like rooms in a secular Chrsitian environment. No English translations by the exhibits and the leaflet provided contained no information about Zisa.",
          "This is a wonderful way to spend an hour or so. The history of the structure is fascinating, and the artifacts inside are interesting. It is a bit of a trek from the center of the city, but there are plenty of sights to see along the way.",
          "This was a stop of many on our tour of Palermo, not sure if this was worth it. However, some great history and a really cool building. Definitely do your homework prior to coming, if you don't have a tour guide, I am not sure if you get a lot of information about the castle.",
          "The exterior is much more interesting than the interior. It is in a nondescript suburb which has nothing really to recommend it. Although some of the interior has some vestiges the of Moorish decoration it has been overwritten with baroque detail which ruins it. If you have",
          "La Zisa, the Norman hunting palace in Moorish style, is situated in a suburb of Palermo. It's on walking distance of the centre if you like walking. It's about 2 km, a little over a mile. Today it's the Museum of Arabic arts. Well, \u2013the\u2013 museum is not the case. I think I",

          "We may have had too high an expectation with the thought of visiting a castle, but to be honest it was definitely not worth the long journey from Palermo city centre. Some interesting objects inside but if you're a tourist who can't read Italian you'd end up finishing your walk",
          "The castle is relatively small but it is interesting to see the architecture and its unique style. Nevertheless, the visit was overall disappointing: the \"Islamic art museum\" consists of a few metal objects and wooden doors. The garden was huge, but it made a poor impression",
          "This is one for History buffs. If you want to see an example of a Norman castle in Sicily with Arabic influences this is a must. However, it is not in a central location, there are a few objects in glass cabinets and the people follow you everywhere which is unnerving and",
          "Saw this on Trip Advisor and decided to take a look - pleasantly surprised given some earlier reviews. The castle has been sympathetically restored, so you can get a great idea of what it would have been like in its heyday. Remnants of Arab ceilings, some mosaics in the entrance",
          "An atmospheric, beautiful and austere place with some gorgeous Arabian artifacts, including elaborate window screens. There were no other visitors when we toured this carefully restored palace. Its appeal is of the 'less is more' variety, much of its past grandeur left to the",
          "It's an interesting place but too far out. I was quite disappointed. The architecture is interesting, but there isn't a whole lot compared to the other incredible sites in the city. The so called exhibitions of islamic artefacts consists of a handful of items. I would have",
          "This under restored old Muslim palace have layers and layers of stories to tell. Don't miss it. Enjoy the view and the cool, yes indeed cool, architecture. Place to be on a very hot Mediterranean day, just to discover how well the ancients knew how to keep themselves cool",
          "Do You think that air conditioning is a modern invention? Do You think that Christians and Muslims have been always in war? Do You think that Palermo is only Pizza and Mafia? If You want to change idea go to visit La Zisa Castle.",
          "Sicilian friends recommended that I see this place, and I'm glad I did. The building gives a good sense of Palermo's multi-cultural past. Exhibits include intricate wooden screens and a grave marker from 1148 in four languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew).",
          "This building is in a relatively poor part of town and even walking there is an interesting adventure. It was in a terrible condition in the 1950 - 1980, but has been structurally restored now. Only a few of the beautiful mosaics remain. Having said that, it is still an",
          "It's easy to forget that Sicily has such a varied and wonderful history full of one invasion after another. \"Zisa\" is a monument to the Norman invasion. It's not a big site but the architecture is interesting to see and the grounds have been reworked in a suitable style to match",
          "This place is well promulgated in the tourist literature and the red buses drop you at the end of the park in front of the palace. There was no, repeat no, English signage and the cost to enter is high - forget I was there in Jan 2015. There are no English brochures, although",
          "Fascinating structure. History is amazing involving the various groups ascending upon Sicily. Highlight of visiting Palermo",
          "The Zisa palace is a good 20 minute walk from the Palatine Chapel and through some of the poorest suburbs of Palermo. The site was diffcult to find (typically, the signing in Sicliy is attrocious !). The building dates from the 13th century and has been restored several times",
          "The simplicty and beauty of the architecture are breathtaking. And the ingenuity of the water collection system most interesting. We had a bit of hard time finding this spot, but were enchanted by the Arab-Norman architecture. Interesting collection of amphorae are in the",
          "Wonderful. Take the bus from Piazza Poleitama on via Dante until you reach the carpark about 15 mins. Then ask. The bus runs all the time. The Palace is beautiful and in pristine condition. 6\u20ac entry for adults only.",
          "The first vistas are marvellous. It splendidly stands uncrowded against the background hills. Even though the Normans built it, its design is Arabic. Scarce water being sacred in Arab life and culture is reflected in the wonderful approach with the series of water elements",
          "One of the last interesting castle/palaces I've seen in Europe. Small, only three stories high filled with lots of empty stone rooms, though some with various old ceramics with no English translations to tell you what they are. They may have been of note, but you wouldn't know.",
          "This is one to cover whilst in Palermo. Although disappointing that all the displays and information was just in Italian!",
          "We were staying in the centre of Palermo and were told by the tourist office that it would take about 40 minutes to walk to La Zisa, so as it was very hot we took a taxi there. As it turned out, it only took about 20 minutes to walk back to the city centre afterwards. The",
          "To a fan of architecture or a history buff interested in the time frame in which it was in use this would be an interesting visit. We were lucky to see it with an English speaking guide who did a wonderful job of explaining the building and its history. However we saw it at the",

          "True, the administrators could up their game with some more entrance signs and some multilingual interpretation boards - I'm sure I missed loads that would have helped me understand what I was looking at - but this was a lovely place on a baking hot day. The honest brickwork",
          "There are many negative reviews of this beautiful old Arabo-Norman palace north of the old city. For reasons I will explain, we thought this sight was very worth visiting although we understood the reasons for criticism. The site is a ruined home that is being restored. You can",
          "First of all, the museum was closed so although we were very interested in the history of the building, but were unable to discover any of it. We then decided to walk around the gardens instead and were very disappointed by what we saw - very poorly maintained, in urgent need of",

        "wiki": "Palazzo Abatellis (also known as Palazzo Patella) is a palace in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy, located in the Kalsa quarter. It is home to the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia, the Gallery of Art for the Sicilian region.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe palazzo, an example of Gothic-Catalan architecture,  was designed in the 15th century by Matteo Carnelivari, at the time working in Palermo at the palazzo Aiutamicristo. It was the residence of Francesco Abatellis (or Patella), port master of the Kingdom of Sicily.\nAfter the death of Abatellis, it remained to his wife, and, after her death, it was given to a female monastery. Several modifications were carried on to adapt it to monastic life. They included a chapel, built on the left side of the chapel (1535\u20131541), hiding one of the fa\u00e7ades. In the 18th century, following the construction of a bigger church (the current Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0), the chapel was abolished and divided into several rooms. The front part was used as parlatory, while the rear section, with the altar removed, was turned into a series of storage rooms.\nDuring the night between 16 and 17 April 1943 the palace was struck during an Allied air bombing: the loggia, the portico, the south-western sector and the wall of the western tower crumbled down. The palace was then restored, and it was decided to use it for the Galleria d\u2019Arte per le collezioni d\u2019arte medievale (\"Gallery of medieval collection\"). Works were directed by the architects Mario Guiotto and, later, Armando Dillon. They were completed in 1953, and  Carlo Scarpa was commissioned the setup of the art gallery, which was opened on 23 June 1954.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe regional gallery is home to many works acquired when several religious orders were suppressed in 1866. They were previously housed in the Pinacoteca della Regia Universit\u00e0 and, from 1866, in the Museo Nazionale of Palermo, which became a regional museum when Sicily acquired autonomous status.\n\nThe ground floor contains 12th century wooden works, 14th and 15th century works including some by Antonello Gagini,  painted maiolica from the 14th-17th centuries, the 15th-century Bust of a Gentlewoman by Francesco Laurana  and painted panels of wooden ceilings. The large fresco of the Triumph of Death  (most likely dating to 1445), is exhibited in the former chapel.\nOn the first floor is the museum's most famous work, the Virgin Annunciate, by Antonello da Messina (15th century), considered among Italy's best Renaissance paintings. Also present are three panels with St. Augustine, St. Gregory the Great and St. Jerome also by Antonello, once part of a polyptych now destroyed, and Vouet's Saint Agatha's Vision of Saint Peter in Prison. The museum contains the Netherlandish Malvagna triptych by the Early Netherlandish painters Jan Gossaert and Gerard David, and a Deposition by Jan Provost. It also houses a depiction of Moses by Pietro Novelli.\n\n\n== References ==\nMeli F., Matteo Carnelivari e l\u2019architettura del quattro e cinquecento in Palermo, Fratelli Palomi Editori, Rome 1958\nMorello P., Palazzo Abatellis.

          "Its a beautiful painting. Compare to the Monalisa. This Museum is a must visit in Palermo and the Annunziata painting is worth to admire",

          "The art in this beautiful building is worth trailing through narrow back streets in 30* heat to see. As lots of other reviewers have pointed out...the huge fresco of the Triumph of Death and the Blue virgin of Antonio de Messina are quite quite wonderful..The top floor has some",
          "So many paintings and frescos are here. Antonello de Messina\u2019s Annunciata is the most important. But you can stare a long time at \u201cTrionfo della Morte\u201d and reflect on it. I was simply captivated by this collection, not to mention all those Baroque paintings and Pietro Novelli\u2019s",
          "There is really one main reason to go here (besides the others I will list): the Virgin Annunciate by Antonello da Messina. One of a handful of his extant works, it's transfixing. The museum also has the incredible Triumph of Death, the enigmatic Bust of a Gentlewoman by",
          "The palazzo was constructed in 1490 and, in the 1950's was converted into an art museum for medieval art, which has stretched into the renaissance. Inevitably there is a focus on Sicilian artists with many splendid early works rescued from churches and there a few international",

          "We spent two weeks driving around Sicily, and found this to be one of the best museums we've visited. The collection has some of the best medieval collections I've ever seen, and does a wonderful job showing the transition from Medieval to Renaissance art I've ever seen. Not",

          "There are a lot of quattrocento Sicilian paintings here, and seeing them all together gives a nice perspective on what was happening in the quattrocento in Florence. The conversion of the building is wonderful, so that the Palazzo is a peaceful and quiet place to be.",

        "wiki": "San Giovanni degli Eremiti (St. John of the Hermits) is a church in Palermo, Sicily, near the Palazzo dei Normanni.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe church's origins date to the 6th century. Later, after the Islamic conquest of Sicily, it was converted into a mosque. After the establishment of the Norman domination of southern Italy, it was returned to the Christians by Roger II of Sicily who, around 1136, entrusted it to the Benedictine monks of Saint William of Vercelli.The church was extensively modified during the following centuries. A restoration held around 1880 attempted to restore its original medieval appearance.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church is notable for its brilliant red domes, which show clearly the persistence of Arab influences in Sicily at the time of its reconstruction in the 12th century, the Arab-Norman culture. In her 1882 Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily, Frances Elliot described it as \"... totally oriental... it would fit well in Baghdad or Damascus\". However, the red colour of the domes are not original, as they were restored in the present way at the end of the nineteenth century by an architect who found pieces of red plaster on the domes and therefore decided to paint all the domes in red.\nThe church lies with a flank on a square construction, which was probably a former mosque. The church is on the Latin Cross plan with a nave and two aisles and three apses. Each of the square spans is surmounted by a dome. The presbytery, ending with a niche, has also a dome.\nThe cloister, enriched by a luxurious garden, is the best preserved part of the ancient monastery. It has notable small double columns with capitals decorated by vegetable motifs, which support ogival arches. It also includes an Arab cistern.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== References ==",

          "This is a must for anyone interested in ecclesiastical architecture. It is probably unique in its blend of Islamic, Byzantine and Catholic features. I hope other visitors will not have to deal with the fat, ugly, ill-mannered apology for a human being who was selling entrance",

          "This is a rather strange visit and in our view rather overrated for what it is. We did however visit on the first Sunday of the month and entrance was free so we can't complain! It is many years since we have been here and neither of us remembered the ruined church but both of",

San Giovanni degli Eremiti offers such a retreat; it is quiet, lovely, simple. I am reminded by the peace here of other such sacred places: Sanchi, in India or the Church",
          "This church is located only a short distance from the Cappella Palantina and worth the walk over to see it. Its beautiful exterior is an example of Norman-Arab architecture - best seen from the church's lovely garden area. While there is not much to see inside the church, it is",
          "Unique example of arab-Norman architecture. Originally a mosque, then modified and enlarged with a Christian cloister. Beautiful and peaceful little garden between the buildings. World heritage. You've got an spectacular view of the red domes, cloister and Palermo old buildings",
          "Quite stark in comparison to the Cattedrale or Monreale, but the simplicity is restful and a pleasant change of pace. The red domes are quite distinctive, Arabic.",

          "Although the entrance fee charged seems high (6 euros), this is an interesting site, particularly for anyone who cares about the Norman period. the monks at St. John's served the Norman rulers of the 12th century. the site also has one structure which may have been a mosque.",
          "First, let me say that we were part of a tour group so I have no idea of the pricing of this site. That being said, I do think the chapel is an interesting example of Arab-Norman architecture. The stone vaulting in the dome and the arched windows are beautifully constructed.",
          "Ancient Church might be of interest to historians but there is very little to see inside Not worth wasting time and money in my view",
          "A nice contrast to the hurly burly of the nearby Palazzo dei Normani, with a peaceful garden around the remains of a cloister and the shell of a small arab/norman church. However, the entry is pricey for the little there is to see. Better value if you are on a combined ticket",
          "We allowed ourselves to be talked into getting a 5 attraction ticket that included this, and regret having done so. Whilst the gardens are well laid out there is little else to see while you are here. It's an expensive place to come just for a rest !",

          "We decided to take the short walk from the Palace of the Normans to San Giovanni, and it was worth it. The inside of the property was not open when we arrived, but the real prize is the view of the exterior. Built by Arab-Norman craftsmen, there are cubic forms punctuated",

          "This Church is a bare ruin, so there are no frescos or mosaics, just the empty Church that is still standing, the garden and a column structure in the garden. Somewhat underwhelming at first, but this becomes a much more exciting visit if \u2026",

        "wiki": "Palermo ( p\u0259-LAIR-moh, -\u2060LUR-, Italian: [pa\u02c8l\u025brmo] (listen); Sicilian: Palermu, locally [pa\u02c8l\u025bmm\u028a]; Latin: Panormus, from Greek: \u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, romanized: P\u00e1normos) is a city of Southern Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Metropolitan City of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nThe city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz. Palermo then became a possession of Carthage. Two Greek colonies were established, known collectively as Panormos or \"All-Port\"; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century BC. As Panormus, the town became part of the Roman Republic and Empire for over a thousand years. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0645\u200e), the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the primary residence and power base of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and King Conrad IV.\nThe population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285, while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people. In the central area, the city has a population of around 676,000 people. The inhabitants are known as Palermitani or, poetically, panormiti. The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the Italian language and the Palermitano dialect of the Sicilian language.\nPalermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and tourism capital. It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Art Nouveau churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music. Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture. Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.\nIn fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe. It is the main seat of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale. The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area.Roman Catholicism is highly important in Palermitan culture. The Patron Saint of Palermo is Santa Rosalia whose Feast Day is celebrated on 15 July. The area attracts significant numbers of tourists each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish markets at the heart of Palermo, known as Vucciria, Ballar\u00f2 and Capo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPalermo lies in a basin, formed by the Papireto, Kemonia and Oreto rivers. The basin was named the Conca d'Oro (the Golden Basin) by the Arabs in the 9th century. The city is surrounded by a mountain range which is named after the city itself. These mountains face the Tyrrhenian Sea. Palermo is home to a natural port and offers excellent views to the sea, especially from Monte Pellegrino.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nPalermo experiences a hot-summer subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa) with moderate seasonality. Summers are very long, hot and dry due to the domination of subtropical high pressure system, while winters are mild and changeable, with rainy weather due to the polar front. Temperatures in autumn and spring are typically warm. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual air temperature of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F); it is one of the warmest cities in Italy. It receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year. Snow is a rare occurrence having snowed about a dozen times since 1945. Since the 1940s to nowadays there have been at least five times when considerable snowfall has occurred. In 1949 and in 1956, when the minimum temperature went down to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), the city was blanketed by some centimetres of snow. Snowfalls also occurred in 1981, 1986, 1999 and 2014. The average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F); from 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in February to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from November to May, the average sea temperature exceeds 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nPalermo is surrounded by mountains, which form a cirque around the city. Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about 1,333 metres (4,373 ft) high. However, historically, the most important mount is Monte Pellegrino, which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain. The mount lies right in front of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"Italian Journey\".\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\nToday both the Papireto river and the Kemonia are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of Mondello.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nShown above are the thirty five quarters of Palermo: these thirty five neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known, are further divided into eight governmental community boards.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nPalermo has a large architectural heritage and is notable for its many Norman buildings.\n\n\n=== Palaces and museums ===\n\nPalazzo dei Normanni (the Norman Palace), a notable example of Norman architecture, this palace houses the Cappella Palatina.\nZisa (1160) and Cuba, magnificent castles/houses historically used by the kings of Palermo for hunting. The Zisa today houses the Islamic museum. The Cuba was once encircled by water.\nPalazzo Natoli\nPalazzo Chiaramonte\nPalazzo Abatellis. Built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical Catalan Gothic style, with Renaissance influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by Francesco Laurana (1471) and the Malvagna Triptych (c. 1510), by Jan Gossaert and the famous Annunziata by Antonello da Messina.\nThe Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas is one of the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from Etruscan, Carthaginian, Roman and Hellenistic civilisations. It houses all the decorative remains from the Sicilian temples of Segesta and Selinunte.\nPalazzina Cinese, royal residence of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and location of the Ethnografic Museum of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nPalermo Cathedral: Located at Corso Vittorio Emanuele, corner Via Matteo Bonello, its long history has led to an accumulation of different architectural styles, the latest being the 18th century.\nCappella Palatina, the 12th century chapel of the Palazzo dei Normanni, has outstanding mosaics in both Western and the Eastern traditions and a roof by Saracen craftsmen.\nSan Giovanni dei Lebbrosi\nSan Giovanni degli Eremiti (St. John of the Hermit Order): Located near the Palazzo dei Normanni, a 12th-century church notable for its bright red domes, a remnant of Arab influence in Sicily. In his Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily, F. Elliot described it as \"... totally oriental... it would fit well in Baghdad or Damascus\". The bell tower is an example of Norman architecture.\nChiesa della Martorana: Also known as Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio (St Mary of the Admiral), the church is annexed to the next-door church of San Cataldo and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original layout was a compact cross-in-square (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern apses adjoin directly to the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture. The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church. The interior decoration is elaborate, and includes Byzantine mosaics.\nSan Cataldo: Church, on the central Piazza Bellini, which is a good example of Norman architecture.\nSanta Maria della Gancia\nSanta Caterina: This church is located behind Piazza Pretoria and built between 1566 and 1596 in the baroque style.\nSanta Maria della Catena: This church was built between 1490\u20131520. Designed by Matteo Carnilivari: The name derives from chains that were once attached to one of the walls.\nSan Domenico: Located near Via Roma, it is known as the \u201cPantheon of illustrious Sicilians\u201d.\nSan Giuseppe dei Teatini: Located near the Quattro Canti, it is an example of Sicilian Baroque.\nOratorio di San Lorenzo Working in stucco, Rococo sculptor Giacomo Serpotta, his brother Giuseppe and his son Procopio, decorated the church (1690/98\u20131706) with such a profusion of statuary, and an abundance of putti, the walls appear alive. In October 1969, two thieves removed Caravaggio's Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence from its frame. It has never been recovered.\nOratorio del Rosario: Completed by Giacomo Serpotta in (1710\u201317)\nSanta Teresa alla Kalsa, which derives its name from Al-Khalisa, an Arabic term meaning elected, was constructed between 1686-1706 over the former Emir's residence, is one of the best examples of Sicilian Baroque. It has a single, airy nave, with stucco decorations from the early 18th century.\nSanta Maria dello Spasimo was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired Raphael to paint his famous Sicilia's Spasimo, now in the Museo del Prado. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.\nChurch of the Gesu (Church of Jesus): Located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of Basilian monks. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the frescos. The interior has a Latin cross plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in St Anne's Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.\nSan Francesco di Assisi: this church was built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an earthquake. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa\u00e7ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in Renaissance style, as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by Antonio, Giacomo Gagini and Francesco Laurana. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.\nChurch of the Magione: Officially known as the church of the Holy Trinity. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the Cistercian monks.\n\n\n=== Squares and public monuments ===\n\nQuattro Canti is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (mandamenti). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa\u00e7ades so the square has an almost octagonal form.\nPiazza Pretoria was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by Francesco Camilliani, the Fontana Pretoria.\nThe monument to Charles V on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631.\n\n\n=== City walls ===\n\nPalermo has at least two rings of city walls, many pieces of which still survive. The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city \u2013 the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east\u2013west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo.\nIn the medieval period the walled city was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east\u2013west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner there was a defence, Castello a Mare, to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at Santa Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porta Nuova.Several gates in the city wall survive. Images of the wall can be seen here.\n\n\n=== Opera houses ===\n\nUp until the beginning of 20th century there were hundreds of small opera theatres known as magazzeni in the city of Palermo.\n\nThe Teatro Massimo (\"Greatest Theatre\") was opened in 1897. It is the biggest in Italy (8,000 m2, 86,000 sq ft), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Paris Opera and the Vienna State Opera), renowned for its perfect acoustics. Enrico Caruso sang in a performance of La Gioconda during the opening season, returning for Rigoletto at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.\nThe Teatro Politeama was built between 1867 and 1874.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe cathedral has a heliometer (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, la Meridiana, on the floor, running precisely north\u2013south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year.\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of time and the calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24\u2011hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to know when the vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter.\nThe Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo Botanical Garden), founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of 10 hectares (25 acres).\nOne site of interest is the Capuchin Catacombs, with many mummified corpses in varying degrees of preservation.\nClose to the city is the 600-metre-high (2,000 ft) Monte Pellegrino, offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.\nAnother good panoramic viewpoint is the promontory of Monte Gallo (586 m, 1,923 ft), near Mondello Beach.Moreton Bay fig of >30 m girth and of 32m height can be found on the Piazza Marina. This Ficus macrophylla is most probably the thickest tree in Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ===\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites include the Palazzo Reale with the Cappella Palatina, the Chiesa di San Giovanni degli Eremiti, the Chiesa di Santa Maria dell\u2019Ammiraglio, the Chiesa di San Cataldo, the Cattedrale di Palermo, the Palazzo della Zisa and the Ponte dell\u2019Ammiraglio. This makes Italy the country with the most UNESCO world heritage sites, and Sicily the region hosting the most within Italy.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, there were 1.2 million people living in the greater Palermo area, 655,875 of which resided in the City boundaries, of whom 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female. People under age 15 totalled 15.6% compared to pensioners who composed 17.2% of the population. This compares with the Italian average of 14.1% people under 15 years and 20.2% pensioners. The average age of a Palermo resident is 40.4 compared to the Italian average of 42.8. In the ten years between 2001 and 2010, the population of Palermo declined by 4.5%, while the population of Italy, as a whole, grew by 6.0%. The reason for Palermo's decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and to Northern Italy. The current birth rate of Palermo is 10.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.3 births.\nAs of 2006, 97.79% of the population was of Italian descent. The largest immigrant group came from South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka): 0.80%, other European countries (mostly from Albania, Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia and Ukraine): 0.3%, and North Africa (mostly from Tunisia): 0.28%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nEvidence of human settlement in the area now known as Palermo goes back to at least the Mesolithic period, perhaps around 8000 BC, where a group of cave drawings at nearby Addaura from that period have been found.  The original inhabitants were Sicani people who, according to Thucydides, arrived from the Iberian Peninsula (perhaps Catalonia).\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nIn 734 BC the Phoenicians, maritime traders from northern Canaan, built a small settlement on the natural harbor of Palermo, which became known as Ziz (Punic: \ud802\udd11\u202c\ud802\udd09\ud802\udd11, \u1e62Y\u1e62). It became one of the three main Phoenician colonies of Sicily, along with Motya and Soluntum. However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.\nThe first settlement is known as Paleapolis (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"Old City\", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis (\u039d\u03b5\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) or \"New City\". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab al-qa\u1e63r (castle, stronghold, see also alc\u00e1zar). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street (decumanus), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.\nCarthage was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement P\u00e1normos (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"all port\" due to its large anchorage, from which the present name of the city developed. The Phoenicians began using the Greek name on the city's coinage from the 5th century BC. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 BC the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275 BC. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several Germanic tribes. The first were the Vandals in 440 AD under the rule of their king Geiseric. The Vandals had occupied all the Roman provinces in North Africa by 455 establishing themselves as a significant force. They acquired Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily shortly afterwards. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic conquest under Theodoric the Great began in 488; Theodoric supported Roman culture and government unlike the Germanic Goths. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. Sicily was the first part of Italy to be taken under control of General Belisarius who was commissioned by Eastern Emperor. Justinian I solidified his rule in the following years.\n\nThe Arabs took control of the island in 904, and the Emirate of Sicily was established. Muslim rule on the island lasted for about 120 years. Palermo (Bal'harm during Arab rule) displaced Syracuse as the capital of Sicily. It was said to have then begun to compete with C\u00f3rdoba and Cairo in terms of importance and splendor. For more than a hundred years Palermo was the capital of a flourishing emirate.  The Arabs also introduced many agricultural crops which remain a mainstay of Sicilian cuisine.\n\nAfter dynastic quarrels however, there was a Christian reconquest in 1072. Normans conquered Palermo after a long siege. Indeed, the feat proved difficult because the Normans had never besieged such a populous city with such powerful walls. After 5 months siege, Normans built numerous stairs and war machines and finnally conquered the city. The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles, including Robert Guiscard and his army, who is regarded as a hero by the natives.  It was under his nephew Roger II of Sicily that Norman holdings in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula were promoted from the County of Sicily into the Kingdom of Sicily. The kingdom's capital was Palermo, with the King's Court held at the Palazzo dei Normanni. Much construction was undertaken during this period, such as the building of Palermo Cathedral. The Kingdom of Sicily became one of the wealthiest states in Europe.Sicily fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1194. Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor Frederick II. Muslims of Palermo emigrated or were expelled during Holy Roman rule. After an interval of Angevin rule (1266\u20131282), Sicily came under control of the Aragon and Barcelona dynasties. By 1330, Palermo's population had declined to 51,000.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nFrom 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the Kingdom of Spain, and again between 1717 and 1718. Palermo was also under Savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718\u20131720 as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht. It was ruled by Austria between 1720 and 1734.\n\n\n=== Two Sicilies ===\nAfter the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Sicily was handed over to the House of Savoy, but by 1734 it was in Bourbon possession. Charles III chose Palermo for his coronation as King of Sicily. Charles had new houses built for the growing population, while trade and industry grew as well. However, Palermo had become just another provincial city as the Royal Court resided in Naples. Charles' son Ferdinand, though disliked by the population, took refuge in Palermo after the French Revolution in 1798. His son Alberto died on the way to Palermo and is buried in the city.\nWhen the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was founded, the original capital city was Palermo (1816) but a year later moved to Naples.\n\nFrom 1820 to 1848 Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on 12 January 1848, with a popular insurrection, the first one in Europe that year, led by Giuseppe La Masa. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was Ruggero Settimo. The Bourbons reconquered Palermo in 1849, and remained under their rule until the time of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The general entered Palermo with his troops (the \u201cThousands\u201d) on 27 May 1860. After the plebiscite later that year Palermo, along with the rest of Sicily, became part of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861).\n\n\n=== Italian unification and today ===\n\nThe majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoy kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libert\u00e0. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, Ernesto's father, and built by the Rutelli & Mach\u00ec building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.\nDuring the Second World War, Palermo was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces in 1942 and 1943, until its capture during the Allied invasion of Sicily on 22 July 1943. The harbour (main objective of the air attacks) and the surrounding quarters were effectively destroyed, as was a considerable part of the city, with heavy civilian casualties.  When American troops entered Palermo in 1943 they were greeted with \"a thunderous welcome by what seemed the entire population demonstrating their feelings about Facsist rule.\"   The two captured Italian generals claimed that they were happy because in their view \"the Sicilians were not human beings but animals\". Anti-sicilian prejudice was part of the fascist regime's world view, being promoted by pro-fascist newspapers, particularly in the north of Italy.In 1946 the city was declared the seat of the Regional Parliament, as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the Palazzo dei Normanni.\nA theme in the city's modern age has been the struggle against the Mafia, Red Brigades and outlaws such as Salvatore Giuliano, who controlled the neighbouring area of Montelepre. The Italian state effectively has had to share control of the territory, economically and administratively, with the Mafia.\nThe so-called \"Sack of Palermo\" was one of the dramatic consequences of this problem. The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that resulted in the destruction of a great number of historical buildings and green areas, filling the city with poor buildings, mainly between the 1950s and the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.\nThe Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo. A CNN article in July 2019 indicated that Sicilian Mafia activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the town of Passo Rigano. \"According to Italian police, the mafia not only engages in extortion there, but also has a large role in the town's legal economy -- with its involvement in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling.\" The police investigation at the time also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area mafia and American organized crime,  particularly the Gambino crime family. According to La Repubblica, \"Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned\".\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n\n==== Patron saints ====\n\nThe patron saint of Palermo is Saint Rosalia, who is widely revered.\nOn 14 July, people in Palermo celebrate the annual Festino, the most important religious event of the year. The Festino is a procession which goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the Black Death in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a sanctuary marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.\nBefore 1624 Palermo had four patron saints, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were Saint Agatha, Saint Christina, Saint Nympha and Saint Olivia.\nSaint Lucy is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called cucc\u00eca. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.\nSaint Benedict the Moor is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.\nThe ancient patron of the city was the Genius of Palermo, genius loci and numen protector of the place, that became the laic patron of the modern Palermo.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nPalermo hosts a professional football team, Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica Palermo, commonly referred to as simply Palermo, who currently compete in Serie D, having been excluded from Serie B after the 2018\u20132019 season.\nAfter the bankruptcy occurred in the summer of 2019, a new club was formed by the company Hera Hora Srl.\nThe Targa Florio was an open road endurance car race held near Palermo. Founded in 1906, it used to be one of the oldest sports car racing events until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns but has since run as a rallying event. Palermo was home to the grand depart of the 2008 Giro d'Italia. The initial stage was a 28.5-kilometre-long (17.7 mi) TTT (Team Time Trial).\nThe Internazionali Femminili di Palermo is an annual ladies professional tennis event held in the city, which is part of the WTA Tour.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nBeing Sicily's administrative capital, Palermo is a centre for much of the region's finance, tourism and commerce. The city currently hosts an international airport, and Palermo's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses. The economy mainly relies on tourism and services, but also has commerce, shipbuilding and agriculture. The city, however, still has high unemployment levels, high corruption and a significant black market empire (Palermo being the home of the Sicilian Mafia).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nPalermo has a local railway called the Palermo metropolitan railway service.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nPalermo's public bus system is operated by AMAT which covers a net area of 340 km (211 mi). About 90 different routes reach every part of the city.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nPalermo has a public tram system finalized in 2015 and operated by AMAT. There are 4 lines:\n\nRoccella \u2014 Central Station\nBorgo Nuovo \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCEP \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCorso Calatafimi \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\n\n\n=== Coaches ===\nThe local coach company, AST, with its coaches totalling 35 lines, links Palermo to all of the main cities in Sicily.\n\n\n=== Palermo Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Palermo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 63 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 48% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.4 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nPalermo is a key intersection on the Sicilian road network, being the junction between the eastern A19 motorway to Trapani, the southeastern A29 to airport and Mazara del Vallo and the southwestern A19 to Catania and A20 to Messina. Palermo is one of the main cities on European route E90. The three main national roads starting from Palermo are the SS113, SS121, SS186 and the SS624.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nPalermo International Airport, known as Falcone-Borsellino Airport (formerly Punta Raisi Airport), is located 32 km (20 mi) west of Palermo. It is dedicated to Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, two anti-mafia judges killed by the mafia in the early 1990s.\nThe airport's rail facility, known as Punta Raisi railway station, can be reached from Palermo Centrale, Palermo Notarbartolo and Palermo Francia railway stations.\nPalermo-Boccadifalco Airport is the second airport of the city.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nThe port of Palermo, founded by the Phoenicians over 2,700 years ago, is, together with the port of Messina, the main port of Sicily. From here ferries link Palermo to Cagliari, Genoa, Livorno, Naples, Tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually. It is also an important port for cruise ships. Traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes (5.5 million short tons) of cargo and 80,000 TEUs yearly. The port also has links to minor Sicilian islands such as Ustica and the Aeolian Islands (via Cefal\u00f9 in summer). Inside the Port of Palermo there is a section known as \"tourist marina\" for sailing yachts and catamarans.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== National rail ===\nThe main railway station of Palermo is Palermo Centrale which links to the other cities of Sicily, including Agrigento, Trapani and Catania, and through Messina and the strait to the rest of Italy. The railways also connect to the Palermo airport with departures every thirty minutes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe local university is the University of Palermo, the island's second oldest university.

          "We were staying in small self-catering apartment and so were wanting to find fresh produce to cook. This is a huge, rambling market and sells just about everything, not only veg, fruit, fresh meat and fish but also all sorts of household things. I had been warned that it is",
          "this was the third market we visited in Palermo, it was busy, some tourists as well, people shouting their goods, prices are fine, but just beware of the street food, it is expensive, they charge more than they deserve for what they serve, the so called street restaurantes are",
          "Typical Sicilian market with all the foids you could eish for from fruit and vegetables to meat and fish and not forgetting olives! Wish we had markets like this in the UK!",

          "I love the markets in Palermo, they are really Sicilian ones. You can find here fresh food and you can feel the rhythm of the local people. We bought here really fresh fish and shrimps, and also vegetables. If you just want to feel the taste of Sicily you have to go and visit",
          "Even on Sunday, when the market is closed, you'll find several restaurants with delicious seafood and the best al dented pasta. Palermo has really great food,",

          "We hit all 3 during our stay and this was the best- certainly in terms of food and number of vendors. Saw veggies never see in the States and all sorts of fresh fish. Easy just to wander and watch the locals shop. Lots going on even on a weekday. If limited on time I would start",
          "This farmer's market is incredible, but I love farmers' markets. The sea-life, fruits and vegetables are beautifully piled everywhere. The sellers are constantly yelling, singing, entertaining. Lots of sellers shout, \"Dai, dai, dai dai!\" Which means, \"Please, please, c'mon,",

          "We were staying just a couple of blocks away from this interesting street market, but the first day we had trouble finding it since the streets are little alley ways with no marked names. But once we finally found it it was a great experience. You have to go early in the morning",

          "Ballar\u00f2 market is one of the most famous market in Italy. It is a mix of colors, smells, aromas, flavors and voices. It's a unique chaos, sometimes there are few people and you can watch the vendors with no stress.",

          "The owner seems friendly at first, singing and joking and happy to give you free samples. But wait until you pay! He charged 10 euros for 1 jar of ricotta di bufala. Ricotta di bufala (buffalo) is in general more expensive than sheep or cow; however, the very best one is still",
          "We stumbled upon this area by chance, real lively a colourful market . Gorgeous produce ... fresh artichoke and beautiful fruit and vegetables . Wonderful displays of fish and meat as well.",
          "Our private driver introduced this small market to us, at the end of our journey. The market is an authentic and amazing place to see what the Sicilians eat and buy. Wide variety of food and product is sold here, fruits, fish, bread, pizza etc. for some euros We tasted",
          "We toured Mercato Ballaro while in Palermo twice, once by ourselves at night and during a guided tours during the day. The market is a wonderful place to see what the Sicilians eat and buy. We were surprised on the wide variety of produce being sold and how diverse the produce",
          "A place the tourist should avoid. Contrary to what some reviews say this is not Sicilian culture. First of all it is almost impossible to find a parking space. Then if you manage to find one you would end up in this market walking among people selling rags and second hand",
          "This was the largest market we saw in Palermo and I just loved it. It was very vibrant and lots of banter and shouting from the local sellers. There was a good selection of street food and we tried a plate of Sicilian cheese and sausage. There was a good selection of fish,",
          "Mercato Ballaro is by far the best market in Palermo. You can find everything from fresh produce, meat, spices, pasta and various knickknacks. The colors, the smells, the ambiance and the merchants make it a unique experience. You can also eat on site and taste some of the great",

          "The largiest and, in my opinion, the loveliest market in the city centre: surely better than the socalled \"mercato della Vucciria\", that is so famous mainly because of the fine, homonymous painting by Renato Guttuso, now (August 2017) shown in an exhibition in the Palazzo dei",
          "Very underwhelming local market. Went a second time to make sure I hadn't missed anything, but really not sure why some people go on about it. It really isn't anything special. Most small towns in France have a bigger and more exciting weekly market. The fish stalls are",
          "Horrible, dirty and nothing special. If you know what vegetables look like, and don't want to see dirty fish out in the sun then I wouldn't bother with this place. The locals fighting in street finished me off..",
          "After being almost a week on a ship, a cute little market was just what I needed. I walked around for a little while, buying some nuts and fruits which tasted excellent. I see that the place has gotten some not so good reviews, but I think it depends on your expectations. I",

          "This is a living, breathing open air market in the best tradition. Fresh produce, seafood, meat and to top it off--Sicilian street food! But there is more, street vendors selling all kinds of everyday items for the home. I got two aprons in azzurri blue made by local",
          "This market is not the place to don your finest. Be casual, leave your valuables in the hotel safe and begin your journey into the past. Here, at the Ballar\u00f2 Street Market, you'll find yourself stepping into the Twilight Zone of Palermo's history. You'll never again see a more",
          "This was the second market we had been to that day. We went to the so called big tourist market called Vuccario but frankly it was a waste of time. It is not big and not touristy. Even the waiter at the bar said that it has shrunk nowadays. So we went to Mercato Ballaro which",
          "When we arrived in Palermo Cruise Terminal we took a taxi van. The taxi driver, in more than 3 hours, drove us along many places in Palermo. One of these places was Mercato Ballaro. A market for the sale of fish, fruit and vegetables, all displayed in colourful stalls. See some",
          "We went to that so called street market thinking that we would find street food, as local specialities such as arancini, cannoli, etc. but they dont really have street food. It is basically a street market in which local producers or re sellers sells their goods. So mostly you",
          "We loved our visits to this lively market. We stayed in an apartment in Palermo and bought lunch there. Motzarella, tomatoes, olives, basil, bread and wine. The merchants are super friendly. The fish displays are incredible and the sausages, salamis mouth-watering. A great,",
          "Big city market, very busy. I was surprised that I could not find the fruit that I wanted there. Not especially interesting, but worth a short stroll. Go to the monuments and museums instead.",
          "It was just ok, underwhelmed and not well organized. It was supposed to be one of the better ones in Palmero. The smaller fish market at Catania was more enjoyable.",
          "I found this market very usual. Vegetables, fish, cheese, olives etc. Nothing special. If you need to get some groceries - thats a place. If you looking for some authentic stuff - try something else.",
          "Good to see the amazing produce and the vibrancy of the market as they provide insights into life in Palermo! We wish we were in an apartment so that we could have an opportunity to use the fantastic seafood, vegetables and fruit in a feast.",
          "Either if you want to buy something or just enjoy the bright colors of fruits and vegetables, you must visit this place if you want to get in touch with the other side of the Palermo culture, besides the churches and palaces and museums. The street life is full of views, smells,",
          "Great big market full of fresh fruit and vegetables, spices, delis. Busy atmosphere with stall owners yelling and people everywhere. Really good experience. Also good place to buy food, prices are cheap",
          "We had seen the other main markets before this and most of the produce, fish, and other goods looked quite similar. We then entered a place where there were murals and very quickly felt unsafe and came upon so much trash everywhere and seedy looking people rooting through",
          "My wife and I visited Mercato Ballaro on a random Wednesday and it was rainy and overcast but the vendors were open and ready for business. Its worth a visit but I was not impressed over Mercato del Capo. We only walked through and didn't haggle much about buying from vendors",
          "At Ballaro market you can see and feel real South Italian spirit. Fresh vegetables and fruits everywhere, lot's of scooters passing, street food and spices.",
          "If you like spitting fighting burping and dri and smells this is the place to be ..stall holders sneezing all over their goods ..disgusting place",
          "Worst meal of a 6 week trip. Ordered pasta bianca with salmon and was served chopped meat... there were TWO dishes with SAME name!! They were reluctant to correct so we let it go. Pizza was overpriced and tasted very cheap. Souvenirs looked like they were all 'made in China',",
          "If you want a huge variety of food, spices, cheap clothes and accessories, this is definitely the right market for you. Our hosts told us more about the other 2 (vucchiara and capo). The first one is great at night time for its street food and the second one quieter and smaller",
          "You could almost find anything in this market: from souvenirs to fish; from wine to cheeses ! Prices are affordable. The best thing about it, is the authenticity of the people, their screams, their bids, their laughter and the fusion of colors :)",
          "I was in Palermo for eight days, and for several of those days prepared my own meals with fresh, wonderful and very affordable ingredients I bought at this market. What was best too, is that it was only a few blocks from where I stayed. Perfect! The market has everything from",
          "I loved it and went several times as it was not far from where we were staying. I bought eggs, tomatoes, olives, cheeses, butter. Enjoyed watching all the \"action\". We also took the walking food tour, and our guide brought us here so we learned where to get fabulous arrancina",
          "Don t eat there,4 shrimp are 5 e,it is really dirty,there is a lot of sea food,the bill on a piece of paper and we payed more then we ate.",
          "People when u write that Vucchiria market or Capo are the best this is not true. The only unique experience we had after visiting the 3 of them was in Ballaro- close to Central station. Many stands with fresh seafood, meat, cheeses and of course fruits and vegetables but also",
          "A real itialian market where lots of people go shopping their meat, fish, vegetables, fruites and spices. It is very colorful and you ll see a lot of things. Small restaurants are located there and you can have fresh fish dishes or taste fresh fruits. Many residents eat their",
          "Loved this experience. Vendors signing out their prices, people grilling intestines, women arguing about prices. A rich mix of history, flavors, sights and sounds. I didn't buy anything but it was fun to people watch.",
          "Where locals and tourists collide with the freshest foods, seafood and meat and herbs and fruits and vegetables, olives and almonds and spices; clothing; tchotchkes of various souvenir worthiness; street food and the mix of people and sounds that make markets just a great spot",
          "We went yesterday with eagerness to this market but we're really disappointed. Firstly do not expect anything like the European markets in Spain, France or Germany. The Italian markets are much less sophisticated and don't have much in the way of cooked take home food. The",
          "We went to the Balaro market a couple times during our recent stay in Palermo. This is a good place to feel a part of everyday life in Sicily. There were many shops for meats, seafood, vegetables and spices. We bought quite a bit to bring home as souvenirs. The street foods",
          "In addition to being \"museum freaks\" we are \"market freaks\". Wherever we are in the world.....markets are are go to. Ballaro did not disappoint. The fresh ginger was gorgeous......the WHITEST mushrooms were a feast for the eyes.....fab looking eggplant....zucchini in all",
          "A great market for lots of fresh food especially fish and olives. I agree with some other reviewers and certain parts of the market seemed a little dirty, but having not seen any other markets in Sicily I can't compare... It mostly seemed fine to me. Everyone that served us was",
          "I get a sense of dred at the idea of returning as I was nearly hit multiple times by barely legal mopeds driven by children. BE CAREFUL OF THE CRAZY DRIVERS! The markets closed very early however the produce on offer was great. I really found it to be quite the melting pot with",
          "You will be undecided between taking tons of pictures of the colourful and lively place and atmosphere and tasting all the specialties offered by this varied and genuine market. Take your time to absorb all its smells, scenes and never-ending \"song-like\" shouts of the sellers",
          "I never saw anything quite like this place except in Morrocco. Would I ever go alone? Never, but my husband is from Palermo and did feel very safe. You can buy anything and everything for the house, kitchen, etc., etc., I could have spent all day in there and wish I could",
          "What a great market. We were only going to buy a few things for antipasti but there Were so many choices of vegetables Fruits, cheeses, seafood that we ended up buying enough food & wine for dinner",
          "This is a great lovely market. Although perhaps not the largest or most beautiful market in the world it is among the liveliest, melodic and active markets to be found. Meander thru, my wife and I felt safe and try some of the great street food, fried large round rice balls",
          "Quite large and interesting, but from a tourist standpoint, unless you are staying nearby and have a kitchen of no value. Many other markets are superior. Spices available. When you get to the end of the main market, turn around and go back, do not go to the rest of the market",
          "This is an authentic market with the authentic market atmosphere-people shouting out saying who knows what to attract customers to their stalls, fish and animal carcasses being skinned and chopped in every direction. The produce, the people, the theatrics and the colours made me",
          "I've been to produce markets in several countries, but this is something else! Great fruit and veggies, of course, but this really is food as theater: men with big knives chopping and skinning and yelling loudly. Not for the squeamish - there are skinned animal bodies hanging",
          "Took a cab here from Mercurre Palermo Excelsior to do some local shopping. Was a cold, drizzly morning but had fun looking at local food products. Bought some nuts, candy, olive oil, fresh strawberries, sundried tomatoes. Great experience. Negotiated with cab drivers for the",
          "The Vucciria is a great place but Ballaro is the ultimate street market in Palermo. This is what people talk about when they say Palermo is closer to Africa than to Europe. It's load, it's busy, it's very cheap. You walk around wishing you had a kitchen and a house full of",
          "A sprawling market for locals to do their daily shopping. There were lots of carts of seafood including baccala` (salted cod, a typical dish for the region) and vongole (clams), fruits (some juicy looking strawberries), and veggies, in particular carciofi (artichokes) and",
          "If you are in market atmosphere, love colourful stands with local production, you will like the place. If you are not market lover, it is just the market like the others. We liked all the markets in Palermo and could not say which is the best :) the are all alike.",
          "Ballaro market seems to be the most popular of the three street markets in Palermo. You seem to just turn up a street and before you know it you're there. We turned left and seemed to just follow the stalls through to the other side. Afterwards we felt that we must have only",
          "So I was reading that this market was open later than others, and at about 9:00 i said hey, why don't i go get some night life street food. I started walking there and the neighbourhood started to slowly feel less and less friendly before i arrived in the market, where i",
          "Nothing special Just another food market. Los of fruits and fresh seafood. The vendors are very friendly.",
          "Avalanche of sites, smells and sounds. Fish, veggies, fruit, meat and some take away food. Useless to buy unless you have a kitchen but unforgetable.",
          "One of my favorite stops in Palermo. I can spend hours wandering the alleys and taking photos. It is loud, smells, gritty, colorful and full life. Most vendors can immediately identify a tourist. I have lived in Italy over five years and still look like a \"straniera.\" If you",
          "Today's Sunday, so we weren't sure if the Ballaro Market would be operating. We'd read conflicting reports that they were open on Sundays, were only open in the morning on Sundays, or weren't open at all. Well they were definitely open when we got there around midday, and doing",
          "This is a great market and if I lived here I'm certain I would be a regular customer. The seafood looked like it had just been caught. There was even a stand selling live giant snails. Another had some exotic looking eel. Well worth a look.",
          "We went to all the main Palermo markets & Ballaro was by far the best. Meat, fish, cheese, spices, fruit, veg, household items & much more. Some of the freshest & largest vegetables I've ever seen! We saw a group that paid for a tour, but why would you when you can easily walk",
          "A lovely market with a wide range of fruit, veg and meat/fish, plus other 'stuff'. A nice market to walk through.",
          "Interesting market with vendors selling fish mostly, but also many other items. Found a bakery with a delicatessen and purchased fresh buns, with Parma ham and italian cheese. Delicious and cheap. Great area to wonder around and not far from the Cathedral.",
          "If you want to experience the true Palermo and buy some freash and delicius produce, go here. It is charming and full of vibriant life.",
          "This market has it all! It's like a little international village with food and vendors from all corners of the globe. There is no dearth of traditional Italian food-stuffs like eggplant, tomatoes, and zucchini. But there are so many other cuisines represented and some very odd",
          "i ordinarily don't like making disparaging comments about places that i have visited. making comparisons to other places is alway poor form. but compared to other markets that i have visited in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam and London Ballaro is a tip. literally a tip.",
          "There are several street markets in Palermo. The Ballaro is one of the oldest. It gives you a flavor for life in Sicily and you can get lunch or a snack at any of several cafes where you can have fresh prawns taken right off of the ice and grilled while you wait.",
          "Ballaro market really was one of the most exciting, noisy, exotic, and colorful and interesting market I walked in. There were hundreds of merchants and a huge diversity of food, especially fish, seafood and veggies. I was really happy here, making photos, speaking with the",
          "Going to the markets in Palermo are a fantastic experience! You don't want to miss Ballaro market, and I highly recommend collecting a picnic while you are there.",
          "When in Palermo don't miss Ballaro!!! It's a topical street market where you can find food, garment and more. It's unbelievable because you are in the heart of Sicily Soul. Don't miss a walk inside it.",
          "We had our boat in Palermo for almost a month and this is where we shopped. Need sausage, they take you behind the counter and let you taste the seasoning. Then they pack it and tie it off to the length you want, only in Palermo! The true experience, find some shade, a cold",
          "Not big, very colorfull. Suggest buing some fruit, which were of a good quality and not a rip-off in the same time. Plenty of seafood - which on the other hand I did not risk buying due to conditions they are often stored in. Generally an interesting experience.",
          "This is a wonderful place to head when in Palermo it is not too far from the Teatro Massimo. It is colourful and noisy and everything that you would expect from a market in Palermo! Wander round, look at the stalls, dodge the scooters and watch the locals, hours of",
          "This is an open air market in various narrow streets in the center of Palermo, not far from the train station. You don't find places like this in Europe and they are disappearing in Asia and Africa. Altogether there are Km of food markets, butcher, vegetables, fish, bread fruit",
          "Tremendous fresh quality and a great variety of fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, sausage, cheese, breads, olives, street foods, and other things related to food. Lots of people, hollering, hawking, laughing, eating and selling. And of course, people like you who are just there",
          "We were here in July 2013th but somehow we missed to visit Balaro. When we realised we were just one street away for a couple of times, while on the central bus/train station, we were even more sorry for not visiting this little piece of true Sicilian atmosphere you can sense on",
          "Take your whole morning to stroll trough the market and enjoy the vivid colours and strong scents of fruits veggies, meat and fresh fish! this was personally one of the best experiences in Palermo, to experience the city and locals, the way of life and decently pick up some",
          "Perhaps it was too late but this was very disappointing and definitely not worth the trouble/visit. If you're from a large city where selling on the street (NYC, Chinatown etc.), this was nothing special. The products were plastic toys and other mass produced items and the food",
          "The food I bought was great, the atmosphere is great as well. There's everything from souvenirs like magnets to fresh fruit, fish, meat, a great variety of cheeses, sweets and beverages. The people who work there are nice and helpful. Beware of pickpockets, though.",
          "The biggest food market in Palermo with a lots of tempting stalls, from fish to veg, olives, meat, olive oil, cheese, fruits...you name it Ballaro has it all, you will surely end up with few shopping bags after visiting this place...the staff are so friendly(screaming a bit loud",
          "A few hundred meters away from the central train station of Palermo, the Ballaro market is one of the oldest and most famous of the city, I visited it one morning while waiting for the train, a walk of about 20-30 minutes from the many scenic and stalls , street vendors, stalls",
          "Here you can still feel the dynamism and excitment of a true traditional market, which is a \"species\" in extinction threated these days by supermarkets as well as shopping malls. A pity! You will also notice the generosity of this fertile Sicilian land and of its seas and will",
          "Loads on offer. Tons to buys, smell and see. We even stopped for lunch to take it all in. Amazing. If you are staying in Palermo self catering do not shop anywhere else for you food!",
          "Liked the food vendors especially the cheese and fruit but was hoping to see crafts of sicily. In stead we saw junk from China very disappointing.",
          "must visit the markets in Palermo...stunning and varied produce with tastes offered by stall owners..lush fresh vegetables fish and fruit",
          "This market was awful. People were not friendly and is not worth visiting. All cafes there rip you off. Waitress accidentally gave us an Italian menu and English menu. English menu was exactly the same except the price was much higher then on what the Italian menu showed!",
          "Many know Vucciria market, but the locals go to Ballaro market! We found Ballaro Market it much more interesting. You can find all kinds of local specialties with shops and cafes along the way. Make sure to have the mini cannolis. Warming, some fish merchants mix old & new",
          "Do all your food and more shopping at Ballaro. Open everyday. Watch your bag. Try all the different things in season. And cheese and olives and more. My children 7 & 9 love it too. Especially if you nibble as you go. Its not too big either",
          "We flew to Palermo and had the chance to hang around for a few hours before getting a train to Cefalu. As the airport transfer bus had driven past all the major architectural sites very slowly in traffic, we had a decent look at them all, so decided to explore the Ballaro Market",
          "To preface this review we love local markets and enjoy seeing the local produce, pastries, meats and especially the fishes. If you want supermarket trappings then this is not your place, though there are more 'organized' shops throughout the market. Wonderfully fresh goods,",
          "We stopped by the market before lunch and enjoyed walking through it and purchasing some fresh fruit and spices as souvenirs for people back home. The fruits were very fresh and delicious.",
          "If you like market streets, then Ballaro is worth a visit. Everything from the everyday things you never get around to buying at home to some decent touristy things. Lots of variety.",
          "In the heart of the old town just off Free to all. We visited in February on a three day stay in the town. We had not sought out the market but came across it wandering the interesting streets. Great atmosphere and colour and interesting to see so much diverse products. A touch",
          "Men shouting to sell their potatoes, fresh swordfish being chopped right there, fruits and veggies and knock off shoes and peoples yard sales- you can find it all here and it's a blast to wander through and try the food. We went on a Sunday morning and it was so lively and",
          "We stumbled on this market while wandering through Palermo one afternoon. The produce selection is remarkable and you will see seafood for sale that is lacking in most major aquariums - let alone your local supermarket.",
          "While other Europeans might be familiar to this style of market, I'm not sure there are many like it in the United States. It's very real, very Palermo, very down-to-earth. If you want a better idea of the real city and not just surface tourism, this is a great place to go.",
          "I have to say we have matkets in the uk and this is nothing special.Just a market selling daily produce. Did not get any sense of sicilian life but bought some cheap cheese to take home. I come from the north of the uk with plenty of markets that are better.",
          "A great place to watch and experience Sicilian life! Be prepared to be squeezed by the crowds and vehicles and also go in proper footwear as the market streets can be wet and slippery.",
          "A loud experience, but not a very big market. There is a difference between the other markets of Catania that sell more clothes and electronics.",
          "This is the place where you can see how different origins mingled into 1 area and soak up the atmosphere. Such markets are already far and few in other parts of the world. Street food in this market such as chickpea fritters, potato herb croquettes were fantastic and the produce",
          "We brought our kids here to enjoy some street food, a cold drink and to soak up some real Palermo atmosphere. Apart from having to dodge a number of motor bikes screaming through the market place, it was a great experience",
          "The real Palermo. Real food, real produce, fresh seafood. This was crowded and noisy and great fun! We managed to get some food - assert yourself or others will push in and you'll stand for ages - we ate freshly cooked whole spiced calamari, chickpea fritters, potato herb",
          "This is where to find the real Palermo...the sights, the smells, the noise, the faces, all the different origins mingled into one area... There are three markets in this city, all of which are amazinf. Sit down, have a cremino, and watch!",
          "This is a place of colours, smells, sounds.I have enjoyed here so much. If you're visiting Palermo than Ballaro Market should be on your visit list. So sorry we didn't eat there, it would be great experiance. We only bought some fruits for later, which was very delicious.",
          "We were told to come and sample the local produce and we tried a local food, pannelli which dates back to Arab times and is only found in Palermo. It is made from chickpea flour which is deep fried and eaten in a roll. Yum and all for the price of an euro. Bargain fruit as well",
          "I loved Ballaro market. It was colourful, lively and there are some real characters. The fresh produce was very tempting. We ate at a fish place which my friends enjoyed. I'm veggie and had the chickpea patty thing which I'd read about previously and it hit the spot on a hot day",
          "You just have to love the life and vibrancy of the open air markets in Sicily. They pulse with life, character and the most wonderful array of fresh vegetables and fruit, seafood, cheeses - all the culinary delights of life.",
          "Everything at your fingertips and of fresh quality. No one seems to want to serve you unless you just stand there and try and make eye contact. If everyone was a little bit more friendly and a little pride taken in their worlplace it would be a magical experience.",
          "The best market I have been so far. Lively, crowded, full of food of all kind. Guides usually recommend Vucciria market which is small and offers much less comparing to Ballaro. We bought good fruit there and took as much photos as we liked - no one bothered. Going to Palermo",
          "Don't go here if you are hungry! If you ignore this advice, you will end up buying much too much of the excellent produce on display in this lively and colourful street market. Eat at one of the many small foodstalls that can be found here. The raw seafood is so fresh that it",
          "We visited markets all over Italy and this one is probably one of the largest ones we've ever visited. A lot going on - alot of fresh fruits, veggies and fish! No issues with prices not being as advertised. I bought a bunch of herbs, dried tomatoes and other stuff with no",
          "A very sad market. The area is shabby, the vendors appear depressed, do not greet the visitors and don't even try to sell or engage the people with their awful looking food often crawling with flies. Seems like it is the same produce table after table although there is a good",
          "If you want to live the authentic sicilian atmosphere, this is the place!A colorful market, full of smells, sounds and food obviously!The visit will take less than one hour and a visit is recommended to Street Food lovers.",
          "After paying 3 visits to this market which is close to where we are staying we realised that the market is not particularly good, and that most shopkeepers will do their best to rip you off. Items that are advertised at a specified price get rung up at higher prices, or the",
          "I enjoyed walking thru the market with our Streat Food Tour..on my own..perhaps I would have gotten a bit lost..?? Maybe not..but it was full of local colour...smells...flavours.. and sights!I do love a good colourful market!!",
          "Local flavor indeed! I wouldn't travel to this neighborhood at night or as an alone female. It was a cornucopia of sights, smells and sounds! Go if you love open air markets but nothing too spectacular.",
          "Be prepared for the hustle and bustle of this authentic market offering all sorts of extremely good value fresh fruit and veg - mostly locally sourced. Apart from the mad cap scooterists who seemed to think it entirely appropriate to barge through narrow crowded streets this",
          "The market is a photographers dream, both for the many wonderful food offerings and for the many characters who play supporting roles as vendors, not to mention the colorful parade of shoppers and browsers. Go be one and buy the makings of a fantastic Sicilian meal, then",
          "Here is the heart of real shopping. You must be there early, meander, listen, look, squeeze and learn how to calculate euros/ kilos.",
          "A very scenic and wonderful market in the open air.Prices can be very cheap and locals know what they want.It,s comparable to Catania,s market in size and produce.",
          "We were here in the fall a couple of years ago. We had intended to visit it but got there even earlier than planned, during a pedicab taxi ride. There were more folks shopping here than at the other markets that we visited. It felt the most working class of all the food markets,",
          "Ballaro Market is my favorit food market in Palermo. Fresh food and good atmosphere. Been there many times since 2007, last time in april 2013.",
          "We walked through the market on our way to the Palazza Normanni. It has all the usual foods and assorted stuff you usually find in markets. We found we had to be careful of the motorcycles that seemed to always come from behind you. We bought some olives to snack on. Doesn't",
          "Our landlady said that the Ballaro was 'dead' as a market - and I would agree. There is very little fresh food there and much was poor quality. All the locals use the Capo not far away which has much more variety and some excellent fresh food..",
          "Makes me sad to think of the exhorbitant pricing and availabilty of fresh produce at home.... The variety of produce combined with the smells and the noise of the sellers hustling their wares is almost intoxicating. Would consider self catering to be able to get the ingredients",
          "Great atmosphere, well worth a visit - even if you are not buying it costs nothing to look. If you are self catering get your fresh produce here! It also possible to buy canned and bottled drinks at very cheap prices. Good for stocking up on beers!",
          "I visited this place few times during my stay in Palermo. It is very vibrant and amazing place to explore typical sicilian cuisine. Fish, vegetables, meat and street food... this is where people from Palermo shop. Do not forget to visit it at night. There are fews pubs with very",
          "Forget about Virruchia market, this is where Palermo shops for their food. Amazing fish market and veggies, meat etc. Mouth was watering as we walked past the stalls. If you're a foodie and love visiting food markets, then you must come here.",
          "I wish we'd been self-catering in palermo after wandering through this fascinating market. It's a photographer's dream and a great place to wander while you eat snacks from the stalls",
          "The Ballaro street market, which runs for 3 blocks, in Palermo is the best of the street markets for food. Fruits, vegies, fish and meat are the strengths here, plus a few stalls selling some general items like spices, cheese, bread and other groceries. Everything is very fresh",
          "Ballaro market was typical of street markets worldwide. Obviously a local favourite for daily produce and miscellaneous products .",
          "A stroll through the market is a great way to spend a morning in Palermo. Amazing sights: beautiful and cheap fruits and vegetables, seafood like you can't imagine. Enjoy the very entertaining vendors and pick up a little snack.",
          "I love going to markets in foreign cities. Whether it's the fun of bartering in Istanbul or seeing how beautifully food is displayed in France, I really enjoy tthem. While there's nothing \"pretty\" about the Ballaro Market, it's fascinating to see the huge fish being expertly",
          "Our hotel was very close to here so we had a lovely walk through the market everyday. There is local fresh fruit and veg as well as fresh fish and meat on offer. As anywhere where fish is on sale there is a fishy aroma however it is not unbearable and most times I hardly noticed",
          "It's in a little alley so don't be nervous to walk back there! Tons of fresh produce and meats. Personally, we didnt buy anything but it was neat to go look and see how people buy their food locally. I would def. go back! :)",
          "If you are one of those tourists who find misery, dirt and derelict \"pictoresque\" you may like it. My heart sinks for the people who live in those conditions. Put away the camera and ask how is it that things have been let so much out of hands.",
          "The market is an experience worth having. We walked on a Saturday morning, and the sights and sounds were a \"cultural experience\" that helped define Palermo for us.",
          "Messy, dirty, smells fish, flies on the fruits and worst thing of all, bikes going through every minute with meat, fish and fruits exposed, I would not have bought a single thing to eat from this market. Streets around have a miserable feel, trash absolutely everywhere,",
          "This place rocks! It is loud and noisy and colorful and full of life. The wares are in your face and I wish I had a kitchen to use so I could buy those huge mushrooms I saw or the strawberries that were stacked up precisely or those olives that had my mouth watering. The smells",
          "Today we bought fresh tomatoes, olives, mozzerala di buffala and a couple of beers, in an ancient market full of singing vendors with home grown produce. This hodge-podge, long, narrow market, is full of people, locals shopping on their Vespas, tourists taking in the sights,",
          "Great market for fruit and veg and particularly fish. If you're shopping for your own cooking best to shop further in as big fish counters near entrance (Station end) seem to cater for restaurant/large quantities buyers.",
          "If this is your first market, it will be great, if it is your fifth, then not-so-great. There is nothing here that sets it apart from plenty of other markets around the world.",
          "If you want to see one of Palermo markets, chose this one. Fish and vegetable stalls, noise and crowd - all as you imagine should be on a southern market. Shame you can buy more as a tourist (unless you chose self catering).",

          "This is a real look back at history. Yes it's all a bit tired. being under constant restoration, but as a feel for the place it is like being back in the 18th century. Felt like Roman Polanski could come round the corner at any time - although invisible in a mirror! One",
          "This is a Palazzo that was lived in by the Princes of Mirto four several hundred years. It varies in terms of preservation and some of it is threadbare and tatty. The most interesting thing about it though is that it is a real window on the luxury and splendor of the living",

          "This Palazzo was occupied by a noble family until relatively recently. It is hard to resist its oddball charm. Many surprises along the way including an excellent clock collection (non working unfortunately). A worth the effort of discovering its location",
          "Wasn't terribly impressed with this. Thought it was going to look like a home as I'd understood all furniture etc was original, but it didn't really. Couldn't make any sense of how people lived in it as a home and more info on the family would have been good as although there",

          "You get an idea of how the Italian aristrocrats lived. The furnishings and room decorations are rather frayed but you can get an idea of how it was in the past. Is it worth the pay and go see? It's depend on your taste. If you like to see the inside of palazzo and original",
          "As a fan of Il Gattopardo loved being able to experience walking through a palazzo that has retained its' history. While some of the fittings are copies the overall impression does not suffer for this. Yes, it is limited access currently but, there is a phased restoration and",
          "We enjoyed the visit especially as aged EU citizens we got in free. The ceilings on the first floor were lovely. The private apartments on the second were rather dreary & where did they sleep?",
          "Went here almost by accident as it scarcely gets a mention in the guide books. A 18th century aristocratic town house with the interior just as it used to be. Plans for restoration but see it now!",
          "We forgot about siesta time and had to wait a short while before being allowed in but this was a treasure worth waiting for. A superbly decorated and preserved Sicilian villa in the centre of Palermo the Palazzo Mirto is hidden behind Carrefour's supermarket. It has a rich",

          "One of the best things we did on this trip to palermo (our 2nd visit). Gives you the opportunity to see what life was like for the very wealthy in this city. Such extravagance and beauty! It's really worth seeing",
          "We were recommended this by the owner of the Bagheria villa where we stayed in one of the 'cottages', as it had been in her family before being given to the State. I'm very pleased she did as it was one of the highlights of our visit to Palermo. This is one of the few palazzi",
          "At just \u20ac2 to enter it is a fantastic museum. It has not been recreated in quite the original fashion as when it was occupied by the original family, but more as a reference to the styles of the periods and as examples of the magnificent artifacts once in private ownership and",
          "Enjoyed the artifacts, but wasn't really set up like when the family lived there. We used a printed self-guide in English that described some special items in each room, but there was so much more.",
          "its a magnificent Palazzo in the centre of Palermo. you can park 2 minutes away in Piazza Marina a walk to the palazzo. fantastic baroc decoration, shame you cant take phots and no guide available, i would certanly go back.",
          "The Palazzo Mirto is hidden away just off Piazza Marina - you need to look carefully to find it. We went there late in the afternoon and only saw two other visitors. Unfortunately, there was no guide and the signs were only in Italian - since our Italian is limited, this meant",
          "Never did manage to see this as despite being listed in our guide book as open daily it was, along with a number of other places we had hoped to see, closed on Sunday afternoon and Monday.",
          "The only drawback was that one is not allowed to take photos inside. This however meant I spent my time admiring the many rooms and their contents with no distractions. It really felt as if I had walked onto the sets of \"Il Gattopardo\" and would find Burt Lancaster reading a",
          "Very nice building with nice furniture.all the furniture desgin for each room seprately and completly special for that room and all together nice to visit",

          "We went through in early December 2012 and were the only visitors in the museum. It was definitely worth the time to see how the ruling class lived. We were the only people being escorted by our guide and, since it was a quiet day for them, it let us into the dining room which",
          "I was in Palermo on 1st January. The most of the shops and museums were closed but Mirto Palazzo was open!! The rooms were well decorated and well maintained. I was impressed at carriages outside also.",
          "Palazzo Mirto is a few yards from Piazza Marina on Via Merlo in La Kalsa. We were not sure what to expect (we were the only visitors) but it turned out to be a real treasure. We were accompanied by an attendant over two floors of a richly furnished aristocratic palace which just",
          "An extraordinary building with superb furniture, porcelain and glass and interesting pictures. We were there about 2 hours.",
          "That was the year that the da Mirto family gave up the Palazzo to the city. And it appears to have stayed precisely the same since then. It's a fascinating place, a real insight into how the well-off of the 19th century lived...and how they could run out of money to support",
          "We visited this old palazzo as we were wandering the streets of Palermo. It was the home of a rich family who have only fairly recently moved on (probably to some tax haven!) It has the feeling of a family home with photos dotted around and no doubt was the scene of lavish",
          "Take a fascinating step back in time, as you stroll through the sumptuously decorated rooms of Palazzo Mirto. Though the staff seems bored and are not particularly helpful, the beautiful palazzo speaks for itself. Highly recommended.",

        "wiki": "The Church of San Cataldo is a Catholic church located at Piazza Bellini in central Palermo, Sicily, Italy. Erected in 1154 as a notable example of the Arab-Norman architecture which flourished in Sicily under Norman rule on the island, the church is annexed to that of Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio. Since the 1930s, it belongs to the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. \nIn 2015, it received status as a World Heritage site.\n\n\n== History and overview ==\n\nFounded around 1160 by admiral Majone di Bari, in the 18th century the church was used as a post office. In the 19th century it was restored and brought back to a form more similar to the original Mediaeval edifice.\nIt has a rectangular plan with blind arches, partially occupied by windows. The ceiling has three characteristics red, bulge domes (cubole) and Arab-style merlons. The church provides a typical example of the Arab-Norman architecture, which is unique to Sicily. The plan of the church shows the predilection of the Normans for simple and severe forms, derived from their military formation. Moreover, the building shows how international the language of Norman architecture was at the time, as the vocabulary which marks parts of the church, like the bell tower, can be tracked down in coeval buildings like the cathedral of Laon and the Abbaye aux Dames in Caen, both in Northern France, or the cathedral of Durham in England. At the same time, the church shows features shared by Islamic and Byzantine architecture, such as the preference for cubic forms, the blind arches which articulate the external walls of the church and the typical spherical red domes on the roof.\nThe interior has a nave with two aisles. The naked walls are faced by spolia columns with Byzantine style arcades. The pavement is the original one and has a splendid mosaic decoration. Also original is the main altar.\nThe old City Wall can be seen running underneath the Church.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Description page in Italian",

          "After visiting the famous neighbor Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio, aka La Martorana make a short stop. The Outside is under construction but you still can see the three cupolas. Mignon, delicate and very beautiful, a perfect place to think, admire, pray.",
          "I stopped in here on a photography tour and really enjoyed taking a moment to sit and enjoy the inside of this church, which is fairly unique. The ticket was 2.20 euro and apparently I could have used it for several other sites along the \u201cRoute of the Sacred.\u201d",
          "Powerful in its simplicity and very spiritual. Amazing history of this church. Stone work inside amazing.",
          "This small Norman chapel a wonderful. Plain, without adornment and almost stark in its simplicity. You feel you are transported back in time. A real contrast to its decorated neighbour. There is a small admission charge but really no more than a donation. The ticket gives a",
          "So many beautiful churches in Palermo, this one is set spectacularly a bit above the Bellini square, which makes it especially beautiful.",
          "This church is one of the early churches started around 1160 and is very Norman in appearance, although the red bulge domes show Islamic and Byzantine influences. This was inevitable in a city where Muslims and Christians, among others lived in harmony for many years under the",
          "San Cataldo is the oldest church on Piazza Bellini. Unlike La Martorana next to it, it was not stylistically upgraded over time. It is a pure example of 12th Century architecture and Christianity, a simple and sparsely decorated space that invites quiet meditation and prayer.",
          "This church is built in the 12 Century and relatively (compared to many around it) unadorned. Visited two years ago whilst it was being repaired. Repairs now finished and it is a lovely peaceful haven",
          "Although small, this is a building of such historic importance that no traveller to Palermo should miss it. The fabric has been very sensitively restored by the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, whose chapel it is.",
          "San Cataldo is situated right next to the La Martorana church, very near the Quattro Canti intersection. For anyone on his way to visit the Cathedral and the Norman Palace, a short stop at San Cataldo and La Martorana is worthwhile and recommended.",
          "The outside of this church is Norman with Muslim influence, the inside a combination of Byzantine-style mosaic, frescoes and more modern statues and altar, Baroque-style, combining to form very rich decoration. Less impressive than Capella Palatina, but definitely worth a visit.",
          "This old church is perhaps worth a view if you find this kind of church architecture interesting. The interior is very plain and stark.The adjacent Martorana church of the same era is far more interesting and truly gorgeous and only costs \u20ac2 entry.",
          "Val and I came upon this place while looking for La Martorano. It\u2019s a little different from all the highly decorated churches we\u2019ve been to which makes it interesting and very worth the stop.",
          "We visited this church while in Piazza Bellini and were glad we did. we had originally thought it was Arab Mosque because of the strange domes but it was a chapel built by a rich mnfor n]himself. Too bad they 'washed' to for public use yers ago. It was probably spectacular on",
          "Unlike most of the churches in this style, the mosaics and other decoration is gone. This demonstrates how heavy the walls and how small the windows were. I found that quite interesting. As there were few crowds, you can sit quietly for a few minutes and contemplate the",
          "For architecture's sake I had to see this one. Not garishly decorated but a wonderful blend of Arab and Norman confluence that make one see Palermo's history. Best photo op is from the 2nd floor of the Parliament building!",
          "Spare but wonderful. Ancient and distinctive. See it at different times of day. We did. The light changes how it looks even more than the typical church. It has a tremendous spirituality, as far as I am concerned. If I lived in Palermo, this is where I would pray. Right next to",
          "I had been in this church before but the rest of the group had not so we went in. It is a nice Church but they should collect donations rather than charging to enter. The exterior is the main appeal to this church.",
          "Built in 12th century and originally a chapel of a palazzo, this church in the Arab-Norman style is a complete contrast to the other churches nearby. Very plain inside with no works of art or statues and just some small, high windows and mosaic flooring, it is the beauty of the",
          "Both the exterior and the interior of San Cataldo are very simple. However, this small church has its charm in showing the walls, arches, vaults and stone domes with a beautifully decorated floor with a large mosaic of white marble with colored tiles",
          "As a contrast to the ugly rebuilding in Baroque style of La Martorana, its neighbour San Cataldo also dating from the12th century is almost untouched. The interior is serene; there are no mosaic decorations, but the Arab-Norman architecture makes it very interesting!",
          "The marvel of this church is its simplicity and austerity. Small windows, no big paintings or statues give to this intimate chapel the sense of peace and communion with divinity so missed in our days. A must see in Palermo.",
          "This is in my opinion one of the most beautiful sites and views of Palermo city. This very old church has a mixture of roman, gothic and arabic architecture. With the palm tree in front and the arabic (eunuch) cupolas it looks very exotic. Very simple and though so beautiful to",
          "There was a fee charge to enter the Church of San Cataldo. I had never encounter this before. I did not think the Catholic Church allowed such practices..",
          "Built in the 12th century this Arab-Norman church belongs to the Papal Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. This church is in the heart of Palermo and is next to the Unesco site of La Martorana and across the square from Santa Caterina. The Church is not",
          "I like this little chapel. It has virtually no decoration inside but the architecture is truly fascinating. Each of the columns has a different capitol and the sheer simplicity helps it to feel more personal and spiritual.",
          "Unlike so many Palermo churches, it's the plain interior of this building that makes it so special. Rather than wall mosaics, admire the plain but elegant stone work and the 3 beautifull domes. Also look down at what's under your feet..",
          "I loved this little church because it is so different from anything else in the area. The very plain architecture is Arab-Norman from the 12th century. Since the 1930's it belongs to the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.",
          "I loved this little church - from it's unique external to its very understated internal yet architecturally interesting internal structure",
          "After all the baroque churches we visited this little church was utter bliss. Absolutely unadorned and in its simplicity quite enchanting. A place for reflection and peace. A Must-See in Palermo",
          "This probably looks more impressive from outside, \u00een terms of architecture. Inside it is very simple, no painting, no mosaic, but peaceful beauty.",
          "A very small church - but one that utterly enchants. The light diffused through the small windows in the dome, the reflective quality of the stone and marble columns, the sheer simplicity of the space fulfills its function perfectly. Add in the beauty of the mosaic floor and you",
          "The church of San Cataldo looks like a mosque because Arab architects designed it. It is actually Norman. The inside is quite stark with little decoration.",
          "San Cetaldo, unlike other churches of the period, is devoid of mosaics. It has a slightly austere beauty to it. There is little to see beyond the architecture, but it is a gem.",
          "This tiny church, which during the nineteenth century did duty as a post office, was well worth a visit. Of great age and architectural interest it stands in complete contrast to the many baroque churches which you can find all over Palermo. M\u00e9rite un d\u00e9tour !",
          "No worth it as a destination in itself but worth it of you are visiting La Martorana next door. It's interesting to see an undecorated Arab Norman church and compare with the amazing mosaic of the the other Arab Norman churches.",
          "Stumbled upon this when looking for something else. It's beautiful in a very simple way. Calm, and quiet. Loved it.",
          "It feels wrong to give such an old (built 1154) example of Arab-Norman architecture just two stars, but there is just not a lot to see in here. Especially after you see possibly the greatest artwork on earth in the mosaics found next door at Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio. Plus,",
          "If you want to visit Palermo, you should visit this Church. With a iconic style, not much bigger, but very beautiful for sure!",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Saint Rosalia (1130\u20131166), also called La Santuzza or \"The Little Saint\", and in Sicilian as \"Rusulia\", is the patron saint of Palermo in Italy, and three towns in Venezuela: El Hatillo, Zuata, and Anzo\u00e1tegui. She is especially important internationally as a saint invoked in times of plague (disease). Today she is being invoked by the citizens of Palermo to protect the city from Covid-19.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nRosalia was born of a Norman noble family that claimed descent from Charlemagne. Devoutly religious, she retired to live as a hermit in a cave on Mount Pellegrino, where she died alone in 1166. Tradition says that she was led to the cave by two angels. On the cave wall she wrote \"I, Rosalia, daughter of Sinibald, Lord of Roses, and Quisquina, have taken the resolution to live in this cave for the love of my Lord, Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\n== 1624 plague ==\nIn 1624, a plague beset Palermo. During this hardship Saint Rosalia appeared first to a sick woman, then to a hunter, to whom she indicated where her remains were to be found. She ordered him to bring her bones to Palermo and have them carried in procession through the city.The hunter climbed the mountain and found her bones in the cave as described. He did what she had asked in the apparition. After her remains were carried around the city three times, the plague ceased. After this Saint Rosalia was venerated as the patron saint of Palermo, and a sanctuary was built in the cave where her remains were discovered.Her post-1624 iconography is dominated by the work of the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck, who was trapped in the city during the 1624-1625 quarantine, during which time he produced five paintings of the saint, now in Madrid, Houston, London, New York and Palermo itself. In 1629 he also produced Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo and Coronation of Saint Rosalia to assist Jesuit efforts to spread her cult beyond Sicily.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\n\nThe feast of Saint Rosalia is on September 4.The celebration, called the festino, is still held each year on July 14, and continues into the next day. It is still a major social and religious event in Palermo. In 1995, 1996, 1997 and 2001 the celebration was produced by Studio Festi.Also on September 4 there is an event related to the festino and St. Rosalia; a tradition of walking barefoot from Palermo up to Mount Pellegrino. In Italian American communities in the United States, the July feast is generally dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel while the September feast, beginning in August, brings large numbers of visitors annually to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in New York City.\n\n\n== In biology ==\nSaint Rosalia was proposed as the patron saint of evolutionary studies in a paper by G.E. Hutchinson. This was due to a visit he paid to a pool of water downstream from the cave where St. Rosalia's remains were found, where he developed ideas based on observations of water boatman.\n\n\n== In Art ==\nSaint Rosalia was an important subject in Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, particularly in sacre conversazioni (group pictures of saints flanking the Virgin Mary) by artists such as Riccardo Quartararo, Mario di Laurito, Vincenzo La Barbara, and possibly Antonello da Messina. But it was Flemish master Anthony Van Dyck (1599-1637), who was caught in Palermo during the 1624 plague, who produced the most paintings of her (see also above). His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward. Van Dyck's series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by Gauvin Alexander Bailey and Xavier F. Salomon, both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague. Recently the New York Times published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of the Covid-19 virus..\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Catholic saints\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Herbermann, Charles, ed.

The church is a synthesis of Sicilian Baroque, Rococo and Renaissance styles.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1310 the last will of the rich Benvenuta Mastrangelo determined the foundation of a female monastery under the direction of the Dominican Order. The new monastery was dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria and was erected in the area  where the old palace of George of Antioch, admiral of Roger II of Sicily, stood.In 1532 the widening of the building was decided. Between 1566 and 1596 the church was rebuilt under the supervision of the Mother Prioress Maria del Carretto. For a long time the architectural project was attributed to Giorgio di Faccio, architect of another church of Palermo, San Giorgio dei Genovesi. However, more recent studies show the involvement of architects like the Florentine Francesco Camilliani and the Lombard Antonio Muttone, already engaged in the project of Piazza Pretoria. The dome was designed by Francesco Ferrigno. The church was inaugurated on 24 November 1596. Many years later, on 16 March 1664, the church was consecrated by the archbishop of Palermo Pietro Martinez y Rubio in the presence of the Viceroy of Sicily Francesco Caetani, 8th Duke of Sermoneta.During the 19th century the church was damaged on several occasions: during the uprising of 1820-1821, the Sicilian revolution of 1848, the Gancia revolt, the insurrection of Palermo (1860) and the Sette e mezzo revolt (1866).\n\n\n== Art ==\n\n\n=== Paintings ===\nOil on canvas:\n\nDeposition of Christ, school of Jusepe de Ribera\nJesus under the Cross, unknown author\nLast Supper, unknown author\nThe Adulteress, unknown author\nWashing of the Feet, unknown author\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel, unknown author\nTransfiguration, unknown author\nThe Virgin intercedes for the souls in Purgatory, unknown author\nImmaculate, unknown author\nAdoration, unknown author\nBirth of the Virgin, unknown author\nPious V blesses Andrea Doria, unknown author\nAlbigensian massacre, unknown author\nStake of the forbidden books, unknown author\nOur Lady of the Rosary, unknown authorFrescoes:\n\nTriumph of Saint Catherine, Filippo Randazzo\nGlory of the Dominican Sisters, Filippo Randazzo\nTriumph of the Dominican Order, Vito D'Anna\nAllegories of the four continents, Vito D'Anna\nThe Soul in glory rises to Heaven, Antonio Filocamo and Paolo Filocamo\nExaltation of the Eucharist, Antonio Filocamo and Paolo FilocamoThe church houses other precious artworks (statues, altars and frescoes) designed or made by artists like Giacomo Amato, Giovanni Battista Ragusa, Andrea Palma, Antonello Gagini, Francesco Sozzi, Alessandro D'Anna and Ignazio Marabitti.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMartorana\nChiesa di San Cataldo\nPiazza Bellini\nPiazza Pretoria\nFontana Pretoria\nPalazzo Pretorio\nChurches in Palermo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Image gallery\n(in Italian) Profile of the church - arte.it\n(in Italian) History of the church - Provincia Regionale di Palermo\n(in Italian) Image gallery and history of the church - viviapalermo.com",

        "wiki": "Piazza Marina is a square of Palermo. It is located down the Cassaro street, in the quarter of the Kalsa, within the historic centre of Palermo. The square is dominated by the great Garibaldi Garden.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Middle Ages the area of Piazza Marina was a swamp connected to the ancient port of Palermo, the Cala. During the 14th century the area was cleared. In the Spaniard period, the space of the square was used by the Inquisition (whose headquarters was the adjacent Palazzo Chiaramonte) for its convictions.\nIn 1863, Giovan Battista Filippo Basile designed the Garibaldi Garden, named after national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi, at the centre of Piazza Marina. This garden is famous because the biggest Ficus macrophylla of Europe is situated in it. In the zone of Piazza Marina are also located several buildings like Palazzo Chiaramonte, Palazzo Galletti di San Cataldo, Palazzo Fatta, Palazzo Notarbartolo di Villarosa Dagnino, Palazzo delle Finanze, the Hotel de France, the Teatro Libero, the churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, San Giovanni dei Napoletani and Santa Maria della Catena and the Fontana del Garraffo.\nOn March 12, 1909, the New York police officer Joe Petrosino was killed in Piazza Marina during a top secret mission against the Mafia. Later a small memorial (an engraved brass plate on a pole) was erected on the square in his remembrance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGiardino Garibaldi\nFontana del Garraffo\nPalazzo Chiaramonte\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Church of the Ges\u00f9 (chiesa del Ges\u00f9), Church of Saint Mary of Gesu (chiesa di Santa Maria di Ges\u00f9) or Casa Professa is one of the most important Baroque churches in the Italian city of Palermo and in all of Sicily.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Jesuits arrived in Palermo in 1549, and by the late 16th century began building a church adjacent to their mother house (Casa Professa) using a design by the Jesuit architect Giovanni Tristano. The original design called for a single nave with large transepts and several side chapels, but it was changed by the early 17th century, to a more grandiose layout typical of Jesuit architecture. Natale Masuccio removed the chapels' dividing walls to add two side naves to the central one. The church was consecrated in 1636.\nThe interior decoration included marble bas-reliefs on the tribuna depicting the Adoration of the Shepherds (1710\u201314) and Adoration of the Magi (1719\u201321), by Gioacchino Vitagliano, after designs attributed to Giacomo Serpotta - both reliefs survive. A fresco of the Adoration of the Magi was also added to the walls of the second side-chapel to the right by Antonino Grano in the 1720s. The church also contains a relief of the Glory of St Luke by Ignazio Marabitti.\nIn 1892, cavaliere Salvatore Di Pietro, former rector of the Casa Professa, philanthropist, prefect of studies at the seminary, and member of the Theological College, of the Academy of sciences, letters and arts and of the Accademia di storia patria, convinced in 1888 the minister of public education, Paolo Boselli, to decree the church a national monument.\nIn 1943, during the Second World War, a bomb collapsed the church's dome, destroying most of the surrounding walls and most of the wall paintings in the chancel and transepts. These frescoes were replaced during two years' restoration work, after which the church reopened on 24 February 2009 with a solemn mass presided over by Paolo Romeo, archbishop of Palermo, and attended by several Jesuits and civil and military officials.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe facade is divided into two sections by a cornice. In the lower part there are three portals, above are niches with statues of St Ignatius of Loyola, a Madonna with Child and Francis Xavier. The upper section is divided by pilasters and framed on both sides with corbels and statues of saints. The facade is surmounted by a curved-segmented gable and the Jesuit emblem. Masucci originally planned belfries, but these were not completed, and the current 18th-century campanile was built on the adjacent Palazzo Marchesi. Behind the church, the Jesuit chapter houses the town library.\nThe layout is in the shape of a Latin cross. The nave is 72.10 m long, 42.65 m wide and 70 m high and is decorated with polychrome marbles, stucco and frescoes. In particular, the marble reliefs with their figural and ornamental motifs on the pillars and the marble mosaics are unique. The rebuilt structure has a double dome and stained glass windows.\n\n\n== Decorations (selected) ==\nDecorations by:\n\nPietro Novelli\nVito D'Anna (fresco depicting scenes from the life of Saint Rosalia)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(in Italian) G.

          "we discobered the church by accident and we decided to pay for the entrance and I have to say I would rather spent more money here than in the famous Cathedral on V. Emanuele. There are a lot of interesting paintings and marble carvings and also a tapestery museum. We were very",
          "You will be amazed when you enter this church. History jumps out at you from every angle. You will be lucky if you find it open. It is in a poor area not far from the Ballaro market, maybe that is why you are so surprised and captivated when you enter the building.",
          "Beautiful architecture and a monument to the beliefs of the day. They certainly don't build them like this any more, capturing beauty, spirituality and moment in time long gone.",
          "A nondescript exterior hides this incredibly ornate Sicilian Baroque church. Worth a visit for the incredibly detailed marble carvings, some of which seem impossible.",
          "Yet another beauty from Palermo's incredible selection of churches. A very peaceful atmosphere to take in after the colourful stimulation and noise of the city streets.",
          "Here was another church that did not look like anything special, but the interior was amazing. I am glad we took the time to stop inside to see the marnle inlay & relief sculptures adorning the walls in addition to the fresco ceilings. Very memorable!",
          "My wife generally doesn't care for the Baroque style. This church's restoration style continously flows throughout the entire church. It's very beautiful and really worth the look see.",
          "So much beauty was in front of my wife and I's as we checked into a place that had this great view every day from the rooftop terrace. We did manage to enter on a random Thursday and there is so much beauty to take in. Its off the path and less likely to be packed or a wait. It",
          "I am not a big church visitor but let me tell you this was just amazing! The architectural and craftsmanship were astonishing, I was truly speechless when I saw this church, do not judge this by the outside, you might even just walk by it. The marble inlay work, the detail, it",
          "Covered with hand painted tiles, the interior of this church is breathtaking. My jaw dropped as I entered. It's beautiful! Bright, light-filled space with colourful tiles, lively (and lovely) detailing. The exterior is appealing, but the interior is awesome.",
          "This is one of the most average churches in Palermo. Palermo is not a city, which has a lot of attractions to offer so I guess that is why this sight is so high on the list. If you do not like churches this will probably disappoint you.",
          "The interior of this church is mesmerizing! the ceilings everything is so beautifully ornamented, it was one of my favorite churches in Palermo. The place also has inside a small museum and in the upper floor a small chapel. We end up being there more than one hour. An",
          "If you are for the first time in Palermo, you will have a lot to do. There are so many things to see and to visit, but this church is really unique. I'm not religious and normally I don't care about churches, but this one you have to see. Is stunning!",
          "Don't be fooled with a simple and usual outside Baroque facade. Inside, this Church is astonishing, so please enter, you wont regret it. I think the interior is in the top 10 worldwide I've seen. So much decorations, marble and stucco work is a feast for the eyes, words cannot",
          "Loved this church. A very distinctive style of baroque you can only find in Sicily when ruled by Spain. Great flashes of grotesque masks and colored inlaid marble-some of the best examples in the world. Just south of the Barallto market.",
          "Luscious, luxurious, whatever the label you want to add, this is a baroque masterpiece. We visited when a wedding was taking place, and were able to witness the people's fervor and devotion to the church rites, incredibly, the church was empty and clean in just a few minutes so",
          "The most beautiful church of palermo, though on the inside. This church has the nicest decorations inside i have ever seen. Every wall has paintings, statues, ornaments etc. a must see",
          "Intricate, beautiful rare gem of a church so densely adorned with marble it's hard to believe. Great paintings as well. Fantastic bas relief marble sculptures that tell us stories and offer the sculptor's lens into bible legends. Just beautiful.",
          "The pictures posted here do not do justice to the intricate and colourful work that occupies every recess of the church. You could easily spend over an hour tracing the vines and peacocks that lead to roses and putti in relief. My neck was sore by the end of it!",
          "We had visited many beautiful Baroque churches in Palermo and elsewhere but this was one of the most beautiful. It is relatively small and not on the main tourist site lists. Do not miss going here. It is magical.",
          "This is a cute little church hidden in a local neighborhood close to the Quattro canti. You have to pay 5 euros to get in, but it's worth it. A great example of Baroque art, this church is a great destination for everyone visiting Palermo. The decorations inside are amazing.",
          "I spent two hours in this stunning example of Baroque art. There wasn't an empty Place on the walls but instead they were covered with mosaics and inlay Stone work. After one week of church going in Palermo this one was my favorite Place to feed a need for beauty.",
          "Magnificent baroque decoration, exquisite work in marble throughout, and ceiling done in a marvellous modern painting commissioned after the original roof of the church was wrecked in WW2 bombing. Awe-inspiring!",
          "Sicilian Baroque style with every square inch covered by relief sculptures and fabulous patterns. Even if you feel you've seen more than your share of churches in Italy, don't miss this one.",
          "This is well worth a visit, and was free to get in. So much beautiful architecture in Palermo, but inside this church is far more impressive than the inside of the Cathedral!",
          "This is a Baroque church with amazingly detailed decoration. Make sure you don't miss the unusual ceiling paintings!",

          "The incredible baroque church took us completely by surprise. Well worth a visit. Its also in a very historic part of Palermo so there are lots of other things to see. Our surprise fave was City Hall where we got a private tour by one of the security guards.",
          "This was not down as one of the main attractions of Palermo and is down some side streets, but the interior was very impressive baroque and on it is on a grand scale. There's a small fee to visit (and a museum which we did not have time to see)",
          "Of all the churches we visited this one was the most remarkable. The interior is simply the most outrageous riot of Baroque that you are likely to see anywhere. You may love it or hate it but it really is unforgettable. It is also one of a route of 4 churches in the Kalsa",
          "We came across the Chiesa del Gesu quite by accident while walking from Emeriti to the market. Chiesa del Gesu Via Ponticello daily 7 \u2013 12 and 4 \u2013 6.30pm Most spectacular church and Casa Professa Piazza Casa Professa 8 \u2013 11am and 5 \u2013 6.30 Daily. Baroque art 16C and used in",
          "This church has a very ornate interior. Lots of inlay stone work and stucco sculptures . This is a Baroque style of church and was a Jesuit church. This style is very different from most churches in Italy so if you have not yet seen a Baroque church this is a great one to see.",
          "The artwork on the walls is pretty amazing. And then you view it up close and realize it's all intricately fitted hand-cut marble! The marble work in this church is truly amazing, from the floors, to the walls, and the ceiling. Too bad they don't allow pictures.",
          "Worth visiting on a walking tour of central Palermo, this ornate baroque church has a simple exterior and a beautiful ornate interior with attractive ceiling painting.",
          "As with many of the churches in Palermo this one has two names, so be careful when looking for it. (In fact we found a few with THREE different names.) this is the first church in Sicily founded by the Jesuits. This church is Sicilian baroque at its top. Camera worthy wherever",
          "Interesting church amidst interesting neighbourhood. Spent some time in there gazing at the ceilings. Go there and see why.",
          "This Church was very near the hotel we were staying at and I popped in as I was passing by. The fairly plain fa\u00e7ade of the Church gives no clue to the magnificent interior which awaits you. Yes the Baroque features are probably way over the top for most tastes but you cannot",
          "House and furniture lovers will enjoy this. Allow plenty of time - we didn't and were rushing towards the end as they were waiting to close. My favourite room was the Chinese Salon",
          "Beauty and history are the two are here represented in a church that express the might of the catholic religon in the past centuries. Every touristi should see it",
          "I wasn't sure if I wanted to visit this church since I'm non that much into baroque, Eventually I popped in and paid my 5-euro fee: I was guided through this splendid church, its crypt and its oratorio's and museum by a kind, young lady called Francesca, who acquainted me with",

          "Had seen this church in the guidebook & thought I would like to go. Then I passed it on the way to the Ballaro Market, which is just round the corner from here. It is so unassuming from the outside that I didn't even realise it was the same place I wanted to see. It is the most",
          "I agree with recent reviews, this church has a plain facade but the interior is breathtaking in its decoration. There is an entry fee, but well worth it. One of the attendants also offered information without being pushy.",
          "A riot of colour in this Jesuit church, in elaborate Baroque marble inlay - walls - columns - floors. The facade was used for the film \"The Godfather\".",
          "Of all of the churchs in Sicily, this has the most over the top interior design. The Jesuits really went for it in terms of church decoration. The Jesuit 'Men in Black' feature in a heroic role in many of the decorations. It is in a rough area, so take care with valuable",
          "This was my No. 1 place to visit in Palermo. It is quite breathtaking, with every square inch covered in amazing carvings, inlaid stone work or frescos. The workmanship is wonderful and the overall impression is almost too much to believe. We nearly did not go in as the",
          "This was not at the top of the list of churches, but in our opinion, it was more impressive than the Martorana. Definitely worth seeing, and there are a lot of great restaurants nearby.",
          "A place that leaves you speachless. Behind a nace fa\u00e7ade hides a wonderfully decorated environment, full of \"mixed marbles\" with stannin colors. It's difficult to embrace everything with the eye right away (also for the dimensions of the church), take your time to wander (and",
          "When you walk up the stairs, and are still looking to a normal church's entry.. you go inside.. and it's not Palermo! It's something else. It's just perfect! Men's most astonishing marble perfect work.. Not as Sheikh Zayed Mosque.... but just beautifull! You could stay there for",
          "Beautiful interior with all the marble. Neighbourhood a bit rough. One of my favourite churches in Palermo.",
          "From the marble bas-reliefs ,to the ceiling paintings and the stained glass there is a festival of beauty . The work in the stones that almost seemed paintings are really amazing !!!! Something unforgettable !!",
          "A church and a museum. Very well preserved and admirably atmospheric. The visit costs 5 euros and you get to ghe see the small museum and the crypt (which is nothing special). A great place to see in Palermo.",
          "Plain exterior hides an interior that is more than the eye can take in. Baroque stucco to the extreme, with added marble inlays and flooring. Truly excellent craftsmanship and well worth a visit.",
          "A plain exterior but once inside this is a magnificent church. It is possible to look inside for free but to get full access to the fabulous decorations, art works, wood carvings, marble etc. etc. it is worth paying the entrance fee and be guided around. Be aware the church",
          "We were brought here on a private tour. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special but our tour guide parked the vehicle and to go inside and see for yourself. We walked up the stairs, opened the doors and stepped inside. I'm sure our mouths dropped oped and all we",
          "Magnificent church from the inside! Amazing decoration in barock style! This church is jesuits', as I understood. Free of charge. Definitively recommended!",
          "This is absolutely my favourite church in Palermo. Very very rich decorated with marble art works,stuccoes..and are all clean without being covered by the dust or smoke. If you visit it at about 5pm, you'll find angels and animals looks brilliant under the sun light that falls",
          "This is the main church of the Jesuits in Palermo. We have also visited the Chiesa del Gesu in Rome. This church is so breathtaking, I think it rivals the Vatican. Nothing was spared, it is the epitome of magnificence, a must see for those who appreciate the great churches of",
          "A highly decorated baroque church. It screams over decoration on every level and it shouldn't appeal to our streamlined simple tastes, but it works and is a huge surprise after the plan exterior.",
          "This is a splendid example of Baroque building. The artistic part is undoubtedly predominant inside, decorated with the same baroque style, for lovers of this genre is undoubtedly a must-visit place.",
          "Every surface was either sculpted white marble, mosaics and we received a tour of the sacristy (beautiful carved wood) and art museum. Absolutely gorgeous. We loved it.",
          "Do not miss this church ! First rate baroque architecture and amazing marble decorations. There is a small charge but the passionate and knowledgeable guides are included in the entry price. Leave at least an hour for the entire visit.",
          "The sculptures, paintings and marble were too ostentatious for my taste in church architecture. However looked at separately, they were splendid and the view down the nave was superb.",
          "Do not even dare to miss this Church. The Interiors heavily decorated with the marble carvings will deeply touch you with the extraordinary craftsmanship",
          "The Gesu church is not easy to find, but we passed it by accident. I am not a typical church fan, but this one is worth mentioning. Gesu is regularly looking from the outside, although it has a stair which invites you to enter. A bigger contrast with the regular outside is not",
          "a rich church where you can admire the beautiful mosaics , I was lucky enough to see an Orthodox rite",
          "wow. What a beautiful church. The level of detail in the interior decoration is simply stunning. Do not miss this one. It does not look like much from the outside but the inside is spectacular. One of the mostly richly decorated churches I have ever been in.",
          "The church is incredible and once it is fully restored, it will be even more magnificent. Well worth the visit.",
          "One of my favourite churches in Palermo, located in Piazza Casa Professa. If you're only here for a short stay, put this on your list.",
          "This church is beautiful. Every inch is decorated with intricate motifs and statues. Apparently the church was bombed during WW II but rebuilt/reopened in 2009. I can only imagine the time and effort that was spent. Highly recommend a visit if you have time.",
          "This church is absolutely gorgeous. Every inch is richly decorated. It was a visually overwhelming experience. Out of the 14 churches we visited in Palermo this one stood out for me. It is indeed a gift to humanity that the Allied bombing of Palermo did not destroy this church.",
          "We stopped in to view the interior of the church and were surprised to see how beautiful it was inside relative to the simple outside. Every inch of the interior is covered with something. The ceiling, walls and alter are magnificent. It is worth a visit to view the Baroque",
          "La Professa, by another name. Where most churches in Palermo show the meeting of cultures, the entirely unified decoration of this church shows the power of the Jesuits. It's worth seeing, just for the contrast, but once inside, don't forget to do something about your jaw",
          "Overwhelming. Ornate - a work of art. You could visit 100 times and discover something new each time.",
          "This church epitomizes beautiful baroque interior. The artistry of the main sanctuary and side chapels is amazing: stone, sculptures and reliefs, inlays, stained glass, mosaics. The delightful side chapels have different decorative twists, leading to significant competition",
          "The church is so beautifully decorated inside you will be amazed. Their were cherubs everywhere and as others have said every square inch of the walls are covered with something. Be prepared to be overwhelmed. Gorgeous. You can view on your own without paying a fee.",
          "This is probably the most important baroque church in Sicily, and there are many, in fact it's importance could stretch far wider than that. It is a complete over-the-top masterpiece. A must see.",
          "The church was closed and so we were not able to visit interior. But there us easy access to this church and would normally be open. The facade is more austere than others which U.S. interesting given the rich architectural history if the city.",
          "I'm generally not a fan of the Baroque style. It's far too over-the-top for me. However, this church is a must-see simply because it is over-the-top for the Baroque style. Our tour guide mentioned that he had heard it described as looking like whipped cream, and once that",
          "The exterior is unimpressive, but the interior is excellent. This is the oldest Jusuit church in Sicily. The marble work on the pillars and altars is exquisite. A must see if you are in Palermo.",
          "This church doesn't look like much on the outside but inside every inch is decorated with animals, birds and cherubs from the biblical creation stories. Not well lighted but interesting if you are in the neighborhood.",
          "The art work and restoration were excellent. Damaged during the war it was restored in a beautiful fashion. A must see in Palermo",
          "This church was recommended and we went out of our way to find it. Close to Ballaro markets it didn't look anything impressive from outside, but there is a wow factor once stepped inside. Partcularly stunning are the brilliantly coloured ceiling frescoes which left me curious as",
          "I was passing by and saw this church, and too a photograph. A passer by invited me to go inside, and I did. Inside the story is totally different. It is very nice, and full of marble engravings! I was impressed! Photos depict the scene you find inside!",
          "Though plain on the outside this church is amazing on the inside. One may say it is a bit ostentatious. I am not really in to visiting churches, but this one is definitely worth visiting, even though it is a little (and I stress a little) bit off the beaten track.",
          "This is by far one of the best, if not the best church I saw in Palermo. The location is a little off the church parade on Vittoria Emmanuel but it is worth the excursion. I find church artistry can sometimes blend and blur but there is an arresting magnificence to del gesu",
          "Near Piazza Bellini and therefore close to San Cataldo and La Mortorana you might as well pull this one in as well. It is spectacular inside especially as it was so damaged during WW2.There's a lot to take in as it's almost over decorated. See it though.",
          "This church looks plain on the outside but walk inside and WOW! every surface is carved, or painted or mosaic or marble patterns. I've seen a lot of churches but nothing like this one. The frescos on the ceiling were unique, there's a huge one of Jesus calling the faithful which",
          "Incredible church like nothing I've seen before. One wonders what got into them. A bit off the tourist trail but if churches are your thing you have to go there.",
          "Just an ordinanry church on the outside... Just walk in and discover an amazing and truely unique church. Quite splendid, and beautiful.",
          "When we went to see this church we expected it to be quite plain inside -- we'll we got that wrong. It is unbelieveably amazing with the marble work and the statues everywhere. It is very beautiful and definitely worth a visit.",
          "This was a real feast for the eyes. In addition to the usual christian icons there are stucco decorations of centaurs, unicorns, cerubs, dogs, horses etc. Well worth a visit.",
          "Often people doesn't want visit churches so I suggest to chose the best in different style to have an idea. This is full of marble buil by the spanish in 1600 more or less with Jesuit prists living still around",
          "We learnt this by our guide. Is the only way to explain the rich style of this church so full of marble. Each square metre has a meaning and there aren't explanations around, you really need a guide, not be afraid to spend money for your culture",
          "This is one of the churches that were recommended to our B&B owner. We paid the 4 Euro ticket to walk around the interior and the several museum displays in the back. Talking to one of the guides was very helpful. Monica was the one that speaks great English and was",
          "a stunning interior to a huge church which is accessed from a not so great street, was a real surprise to look in!",
          "This baroque church is really beautiful. The walls are covered in marble decorations, being delicate rather than flamboyant. You can enter the back of the church and see the overall picture without paying. However it is well worth paying to be able to see all the beautiful",
          "This church is a masterpice of Spanish style, so rich of marble also if was bombed during the second world war",
          "It took us ages even with GPS Google maps preloaded to just find this place. You do have to navigate round busy palamero, where the buildings are high and he streets are long and winding! This was worth the getting lost, some of the most enchanting Christian architectural",

          "Instead of the usual displays of Baroque sculpture and painting in a church, this building features a seemingly endless series of cut marble decorations, finely fitted into a mosaic-like pattern covering the walls of the interior. Check the hours before you go, because it closes",
          "The baroque interior of the Church is out-of-this world literally! It's like an icing cake and took the sculptors almost half a century to make but the outcome is simply brilliant! One could only imagine the grandeur and splendour of Palermo then. Of many churches that I have",
          "This is a beautiful baroque church with gorgeous decorations, stuccoes, columns. We almost missed going down to the crypt - nothing much there but still interesting. There always seem to be weddings going on here and there was one while we were there- nice cultural experience.",
          "Enough pietra dura for a whole Taj Mahal! And some lovely cherubs too. It was very badly damaged by allied bombing in WWII so it is remarkable to reflect that much of this amazing craftsmanship was done in fairly recent times, and the skills are not completely dead.",
          "I am not a fan of Baroque but this is really well done. As always, Sicily has its own twist on things and this is not an exception. The marble intarsio walls were exceptional.",

        "wiki": "The Palatine Chapel (Italian: Cappella Palatina), is the royal chapel of the Norman palace in Palermo, Sicily. This building is a mixture of Byzantine, Norman and Fatimid architectural styles, showing the tricultural state of Sicily during the 12th century after Roger II's father and uncle conquered the island.\nAlso referred to as a Palace church or Palace chapel, it was commissioned by Roger II of Sicily in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the mosaics being only partially finished by 1143. The sanctuary, dedicated to Saint Peter, is reminiscent of a domed basilica. It has three apses, as is usual in Byzantine architecture, with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical columns. The muqarnas ceiling of the nave and the chapel's rectilinear form show the Fatimid influence in the building's construction\n\n\n== Mosaics ==\n\nThe mosaics of the Palatine Chapel are of unparalleled elegance as concerns elongated proportions and streaming draperies of figures. They are also noted for subtle modulations of colour and luminance. The oldest are probably those covering the ceiling, the drum, and the dome. The shimmering mosaics of the transept, presumably dating from the 1140s and attributed to Byzantine artists, with an illustrated scene, along the north wall, of St. John in the desert and a landscape of Agnus Dei. Below this are five saints, the Greek fathers of the church, St. Gregory of Nissa, St. Gregory the Theologian, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom and St. Nicholas. The three central figures, St. Gregory, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, allude to the Orthodox cult known as the Three Hierarchs, which originated fifty years earlier. Every composition is set within an ornamental frame, not dissimilar to that used in contemporaneous mosaic icons. \nThe rest of the mosaics, dated to the 1160s or the 1170s, are executed in a cruder manner and feature Latin (rather than Greek) inscriptions. Probably a work of local craftsmen, these pieces are more narrative and illustrative than transcendental. A few mosaics have a secular character and represent oriental flora and fauna. This may be the only substantial passage of secular Byzantine mosaic extant today.\n\n\n== Muqarnas ceiling ==\nThe structure is influenced by Fatimid art style, with the nave ceiling taking from Fatimid art through the use of Muqarnas. The nave is similar to Islamic reception halls with the presence of the muqarnas vaulted ceiling and arches along the colonnade. There is also an indication of Kufic script in the Cappella Palatina, this however, is highly debated by scholars because the inscriptions were removed later. It is thought to be likely that these Kufic inscriptions were intended for the structure due to the presence of Kufic inscriptions in other structures built for or by King Roger II. The Cappella Palatina is also influenced by the Islamic style of having rectilinear patterns, uncommon to European art at the time.The hundreds of facets of the Muqarnas ceiling were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and zoomorphic designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Egyptian Fatimid Art, these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals.\n\nMost muqarnas are made out of stucco or stone but the muqarnas in the Cappella Palatina are molded and carved with wood. There are arch shaped panels as the main construction and hidden panels that help center wood cuts for the small vaults in the muqarnas. The muqarnas has 5 horizontal tiers that allow a smooth transition from the ceiling to the walls of the nave. The ceiling is supported by horizontal cavetto wood moldings that touch the upper part of the windows. There are 8 point stars on the ceiling of the nave that are created with an overlay of two squares at a 45-degree angle. The muqarnas ceiling was built most likely after the mosaics of the nave ordered by William I.\n\n\n== Chapel ==\n\nThe chapel combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the Norman architecture and door decor, the  Arabic arches and ceiling designs and script adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian cross.\nThe Cappella Palatina is built along an east-west axis. On the west side resides the throne platform and on the east side is the sanctuary with the nave connecting these two sides, with domes over each side.  Along the northern wall of the sanctuary is the royal balcony and the northern chapel, where the King would watch and listen to the liturgy on special feast days. Along the nave runs two rows of colonnades, with windows in between each colonnade. The chapel was decorated with gold, pearls, porphyry, silk and marble.\n\n\n== Nave ==\nThe nave, constructed under Roger II, did not contain any Christian images. These were added later by Roger II's successors, William I and William II. The nave's ceiling consists of Arab, Greek and Latin inscriptions.\nThe frame for the royal throne sets against the west wall of the nave. There are six steps leading up to where the throne would be, along with two heraldic lions in two roundels upon the spandrels over the throne frame gable.\nPart of the nave of the Cappella Palatina\nThe nave had different forms of decoration from the north and south to the east and west. Intricate lasing from the ceiling mold outline the arches of the nave in the north and South. These outlines are accompanied by oval medallions and cartouches.  In the East and West, the decoration is similar to the muqarnas ceiling but is missing some molding for the borders of the ceiling.\n\n\n== Sanctuary ==\n\nAs an expression of Norman culture, St. Dionysius and St. Martin are represented in the sanctuary. Mosaics are of Byzantine culture in their composition and subjects. The apex of the dome consists of the Pantokrator, with rows of angels, prophets, evangelists and saints. The Byzantine motif ends abruptly with scenes from Christ's life along the south wall of the southern transept arm, while the north wall consists of warrior saints.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nSlobodan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107 considers the Palatine Cappella a reflection of Middle Byzantine art. Illustrating architectural and artistic genius to juxtapose Sicily's \"melting pot\" culture.\nAccording to European historians, Roger II made the decision to make the throne room and chapel equal in the main part of the Cappella Palatina in order to send a message to the Papacy and other rulers of Europe that he was going to stay in Sicily and there was nothing they could do about it.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAgnello, Fabrizio. \u201cThe Painted Ceiling Of The Nave Of The Cappella Palatina In Palermo: An Essay On Its Geometric And Constructive Features.\u201d Muqarnas Online, vol. 27, no. 1, 2011, pp. 407\u2013447., doi:10.1163/22118993-90000170.\nBooms, Dirk. \u201cThe Normans: The Conquest.\u201d Sicily: Culture and Conquest: by Dirk Booms and Peter Higgs, New York, 2016, pp. 178\u2013220.\nBritt, Karen C. \u201cRoger II of Sicily: Rex, Basileus, and Khalif?

          "This is the chapel at the Norman Palace and is rightly one of the must-see sites in Palermo. It is extremely richly decorated inside with detailed mosaics and a lot of gold. It is also interesting for the mixtures of traditions and styles with the Romano-Byzantine mosaic",
          "Housed in the recently reorganised Norman Palace there are few adequate superlatives. You just have to see it- ideally in the winter months when smart phone infection is least prevalent",
          "wow! just do not miss it. one of the most beautiful churches I saw in Sicily, so different from the east cost but still amazing.",
          "It's definitely not the biggest, nor the most impressive from the outside but holy smokes, this place is without a doubt jaw dropping on the inside. A must go for visitors of the city!",
          "Best presented mosaics in Sicily, as they are so well lit. Much easier to appreciate than Monreale or Cefalu.",
          "Since I live in an Orthodox country I am always interested in the Katholic statues on the churches. This church had a lot of Katholic Saints and their statues which was great for me. The building itself is very big and very well maintained. It has a beautiful garden outside",
          "The highlight of my visit to Palermo. I almost lost this opportunity as it closed around mid day on 1st November(Tutti Santi). However I went back the next day and was truly impressed by this beautiful chapel. Not to be missed.",
          "It was mind-blowing - I flew 7500 km to see this and it was worth every Euro. The history created context - but I came for the art",
          "Wow! The room was a riot of gold and mosaics, telling the stories of Peter and Paul but in the iconic Byzantine style and with an arabic ceiling. Quite the fusion! A picture paints a thousand words so it's better to look at the photos really! When we came out of the chapel",

          "I missed this place on two previous visits, it was closed for government functions, what else is new. Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, all came, built the Palace and left. Then, the Normans embellished it in the 12th & 13th Centuries and the Spanish added the grand facade in the",

          "Well worth the fee, the effort, the cues. This is the best historic-artistic-architectural site in Palermo. There will be crowds. If they ebb and flow, don't rush. Take time to be in the right places to fully appreciate the stunning beauty of this place. Stay inside for at least",
          "A must when in Sicily. An unbelievably grand and gorgeous interior, of glittering gold mosaics and Moorish stalactite ceilings. Never seen anything like it in all our European travels so far. 2,000kg of gold apparently used in its design. That wonderful blend of Arab/Norman",
          "So much history and art to explore in the beautiful Cappella Palatinate. Make sure this is on your itinerary.",
          "This is a beautiful place, the mosaics are incredible! highly recommend to see. the only downside is the available space - the is not much room to wonder around- there were few tours whilst we were there and they have taken a lot of space, so we had to wait for them to leave to",

          "Not as big as Monreale but of higher quality as befits the king's private chapel. Gold mosaics line the whole apse. Thankfully we got there early as later on lots of tours arrived making it uncomfortably full. I think they restrict the numbers entering when it gets busy. Not",

          "I added this to my itinerary fairly last minute but the visit was well worth it. I was only able to get a ticket for the whole palace which included the chapel visit even though online it said they could be bought separately (I wasn't really interested in the palace itself).",

          "The Royal Palace is only open on days when the Sicilian Parliament is sitting, but you can usually get into the Palatine Chapel and it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. It\u2019s medieval and combines Arabic and Norman styles, so you\u2019ll find it promoted in literature as part of the",

          "This chapel was in the true sense awe inspiring. The influences of all the invaders can be seen and the use of gold tiling brings the pictures alive. If there is one thing that you see whilst in Palermo, see this.",
          "There are plenty of churches in Palermo and around. However, this one has the most impressive and gorgeous interior of them all. The gold colour and all the details were astonishing and it is definitely one of the first thing you should do when visiting Palermo.",

          "So much to see so little time. We found the audio guide of little use.It was very difficult to orientate yourself with the things the guide was talking about. this inspire of the fact that everything was numbered. Having said that we could have hired a guide which I recommend",
          "This is another step up from the mosaics at Ravenna. Do try and pick a quiet time so you can look around at the ceilings without too many obstacles. Find out how to turn the flash off on your phone but photos are permitted",

          "It's inevitable to queue to see such a unique wonder, comparable to the Sistine chapel in wealth and magnificence. It must endure millions of visitors each year, but it is so well preserved, it is almost unbelievable. It is a jewel from top to bottom, almost overwhelming.",

          "One of the worst museum organizers I have seen, buy the ticket not on site but somewhere else, no toilet, found a toilet but works only with 50 cent, paid full ticket but was told second floor is closed (for no reason without even mentioning anywhere), and no proper description of items in English. Simply Frustrating!!!!",

          "Looked great, too expensive in my opinion. Walk took about 30 mins, cost 12 euro per person. \nNice, but too expensive compared to how much there was to see. The garden was nice though :)",
          "A very beautifully decorated church located inside the Norman Palace. Unfortunately, this and the gardens were the only places we could visit (early May 2019) as the rest was undergoing renovations. We paid \u20ac9 entrance fee, I felt it was a bit on the expensive side.(We weren't told that half the palace was off limits)",
          "Spectacular chapel, amazing historical place and a surprising mixture of catholic and Islamic heritage in a same place. It\u2019s amazing to see the mosaics in the marble floor, similar to Alhambra in Spain, and the incredible ceiling filled \u2026",

        "wiki": "Santa Maria dello Spasimo, or Lo Spasimo, is an unfinished Catholic church in the Kalsa neighborhood in Palermo, Sicily, on Via dello Spasimo.\nConstruction of the church and accompanying monastery of the Olivetan Order began in 1509 with a papal bull from Julius II, on land bequeathed by Giacomo Basilic\u00f2, a lawyer and the widower of a rich noblewoman.  The Spasimo or Swoon of the Virgin was a controversial idea in late medieval and Renaissance Catholic devotion. The church commissioned the  painting by Raphael, Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary, or Lo Spasimo di Sicilia, as it is also known.  This was completed in Rome in about 1514-165, but in 1622 the Spanish Viceroy of Naples twisted arms and obtained its sale to Philip IV of Spain, and it is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.\nThe church was never completed because of the rising Turkish threat in 1535, where resources meant for the church were diverted to fortifications of the city against any possible incursions.  Even in its unfinished states, Lo Spasimo shows the late Gothic style architecture that permeated building practices in Palermo at the time as well as the Spanish influence in the city.The church now hosts open air musical, theatrical and cultural events because of its lack of a roof.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPenny, Nicholas,  National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Sixteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume I, 2004, National Gallery Publications Ltd, ISBN 1-85709-908-7\nBellafiore, Giuseppe.

        "wiki": "Porta Nuova is a monumental city gate of Palermo. It represents the entrance of the Cassaro (the main and most ancient street of the city) from Corso Calatafimi (the way to Monreale) and is located beside Palazzo dei Normanni, royal palace of Palermo. The gate was built to celebrate the Charles V's conquest of Tunis (1535) and his visit to the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the historian Tommaso Fazello the original gate was built in the 15th century. The building was initially called \"Porta dell'Aquila\" (\"Gate of the Eagle\"), but the people of Palermo got used to call it \"Porta Nuova\" (\"New Gate\").After the Charles V's conquest of Tunis, the Emperor came to Sicily. He entered in Palermo through this gate on 5 September 1535. In order to commemorate this event, the Senate of Palermo decreed to rebuild the gate in a more sumptuous style. The Viceroy of Sicily Marcantonio Colonna set off the construction in 1583. The gate was completed in 1584. The Viceroy renamed it \"Porta Austriaca\" (\"Austrian Gate\"). For this reason the building was also called \"Porta Imperiale\" (\"Imperial Gate\"). But nevertheless, the name \"Porta Nuova\" continues to be used.\nThe gate was destroyed in 1667 because of a fire erupted inside the warehouse of the building. The Senate of Palermo commissioned the architect Gaspare Guercio to rebuild the gate. The work was completed in 1669.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe facade leading to the Cassaro has the typical style of the triumphal arches. The facade leading to the Corso Calatifimi and Piazza Indipendenza presents four big telamones depicting the Moors defeated by Charles V.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCassaro\nCorso Calatafimi\nPalazzo dei Normanni\nPiazza Indipendenza\nPorta Felice\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) History of the gate - Provincia Regionale di Palermo",

In 1581 the works of accommodation of the fountain on the square.\nThe large central fountain is the focal point for sixteen nude statues of nymphs, humans, mermaids and satyrs. Since eighteenth century in 1860, the fountain was considered the representation of corrupt municipalities, and Palermo nicknamed the square with the nudity of the statues, the Square of Shame (Piazza della vergogna.) This may have also been reflecting the prevailing influence of the Spanish Inquisition during that time. \n\n\n== Description ==\nAt the center of the square is the Fontana Pretoria (1554), by Francesco Camilliani, occupying a large part of the extension that strongly characterizes the Plan Praetorian.\nThree of the four sides are enclosed by buildings: the Praetorian Palace (the town hall) built in fourteenth century and renovated in nineteenth century, the Church of St. Catherine (end of sixteenth century), and two baronial palaces: Palazzo Bonocore and Palazzo Bordonaro. The fourth side of the square with a staircase descends to Via Maqueda.",

          "Located next to Quatro Canti, the Pretoria Square is the place where Fontana della Vergogna (Fountain of Shame) is located. Some of the buildings around the fountain are sadly neglected, yet the fountain has been recently renovated and looks amazing. I'm trying to figure out",
          "The Sicilians do things differently and this piazza is, somehow, emblematic of the difference between Sicilians and the peninsula. In stark contrast to the dominant Norman/Arab architecture, this piazza is dominated by the Mannerist Fontana della Vergogna (Fountain of Shame), so",
          "The story of the Piazza is a metaphore of the culture of Palermo and Sicily. On the front of the Municipal building we enjoyed the most important events of the history of Sicily through the plaques of remembrace",
          "We walked across to the Pretoria Fountain which was very pretty although the square itself was run down with derelict buildings and graffiti. We had some great views of the fountain from Saint Catherine of Alexandria Monastery but up close the statues don't really have the same",
          "You'll find the Piazza and the famous Fontana di Vergogna (Fountain of Shame) at the end of a narrow passage. The place is very depressing \u2013 surrounded by tall buildings that look threatening down on you and make you feel like you lack air. Foolishly designed close to a convent",
          "Easy to find it. Nice square but buildings should be renovated around. Good to visit together with other sights in the neighborhood.",
          "This is a large fountain is a relatively small space. There is much to look at and discover but some of the statuary seems quite modern in style and could have come from the mid-twentieth century rather than the renaissance. It is worth a detour if time allows.",
          "The design is unimaginative, the quality of sculpture is so-so, the piazza itself is unimpressive. If it wasn't for the nudity and the scandal it generated (including the name), guidebooks would hardly mention it. Since you will pass it after visiting two terrific nearby",
          "Atmospheric intimate piazza, with ancient buildings all around, peeling but grand and the fountain with its statues and carvings in the middle.Reminded me very slightly of the Trevi in Rome but it's not so elaborate or quite so beautiful. But the whole thing is glorious.Real,",

        "wiki": "Palermo ( p\u0259-LAIR-moh, -\u2060LUR-, Italian: [pa\u02c8l\u025brmo] (listen); Sicilian: Palermu, locally [pa\u02c8l\u025bmm\u028a]; Latin: Panormus, from Greek: \u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, romanized: P\u00e1normos) is a city of Southern Italy, the capital of both the autonomous region of Sicily and the Metropolitan City of Palermo. The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nThe city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz. Palermo then became a possession of Carthage. Two Greek colonies were established, known collectively as Panormos or \"All-Port\"; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century BC. As Panormus, the town became part of the Roman Republic and Empire for over a thousand years. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0645\u200e), the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the primary residence and power base of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and King Conrad IV.\nThe population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285, while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people. In the central area, the city has a population of around 676,000 people. The inhabitants are known as Palermitani or, poetically, panormiti. The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the Italian language and the Palermitano dialect of the Sicilian language.\nPalermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and tourism capital. It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Art Nouveau churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music. Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture. Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.\nIn fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe. It is the main seat of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale. The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area.Roman Catholicism is highly important in Palermitan culture. The Patron Saint of Palermo is Santa Rosalia whose Feast Day is celebrated on 15 July. The area attracts significant numbers of tourists each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish markets at the heart of Palermo, known as Vucciria, Ballar\u00f2 and Capo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPalermo lies in a basin, formed by the Papireto, Kemonia and Oreto rivers. The basin was named the Conca d'Oro (the Golden Basin) by the Arabs in the 9th century. The city is surrounded by a mountain range which is named after the city itself. These mountains face the Tyrrhenian Sea. Palermo is home to a natural port and offers excellent views to the sea, especially from Monte Pellegrino.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nPalermo experiences a hot-summer subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa) with moderate seasonality. Summers are very long, hot and dry due to the domination of subtropical high pressure system, while winters are mild and changeable, with rainy weather due to the polar front. Temperatures in autumn and spring are typically warm. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual air temperature of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F); it is one of the warmest cities in Italy. It receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year. Snow is a rare occurrence having snowed about a dozen times since 1945. Since the 1940s to nowadays there have been at least five times when considerable snowfall has occurred. In 1949 and in 1956, when the minimum temperature went down to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), the city was blanketed by some centimetres of snow. Snowfalls also occurred in 1981, 1986, 1999 and 2014. The average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F); from 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in February to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from November to May, the average sea temperature exceeds 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nPalermo is surrounded by mountains, which form a cirque around the city. Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about 1,333 metres (4,373 ft) high. However, historically, the most important mount is Monte Pellegrino, which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain. The mount lies right in front of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"Italian Journey\".\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\nToday both the Papireto river and the Kemonia are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of Mondello.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nShown above are the thirty five quarters of Palermo: these thirty five neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known, are further divided into eight governmental community boards.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nPalermo has a large architectural heritage and is notable for its many Norman buildings.\n\n\n=== Palaces and museums ===\n\nPalazzo dei Normanni (the Norman Palace), a notable example of Norman architecture, this palace houses the Cappella Palatina.\nZisa (1160) and Cuba, magnificent castles/houses historically used by the kings of Palermo for hunting. The Zisa today houses the Islamic museum. The Cuba was once encircled by water.\nPalazzo Natoli\nPalazzo Chiaramonte\nPalazzo Abatellis. Built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical Catalan Gothic style, with Renaissance influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by Francesco Laurana (1471) and the Malvagna Triptych (c. 1510), by Jan Gossaert and the famous Annunziata by Antonello da Messina.\nThe Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas is one of the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from Etruscan, Carthaginian, Roman and Hellenistic civilisations. It houses all the decorative remains from the Sicilian temples of Segesta and Selinunte.\nPalazzina Cinese, royal residence of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and location of the Ethnografic Museum of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nPalermo Cathedral: Located at Corso Vittorio Emanuele, corner Via Matteo Bonello, its long history has led to an accumulation of different architectural styles, the latest being the 18th century.\nCappella Palatina, the 12th century chapel of the Palazzo dei Normanni, has outstanding mosaics in both Western and the Eastern traditions and a roof by Saracen craftsmen.\nSan Giovanni dei Lebbrosi\nSan Giovanni degli Eremiti (St. John of the Hermit Order): Located near the Palazzo dei Normanni, a 12th-century church notable for its bright red domes, a remnant of Arab influence in Sicily. In his Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily, F. Elliot described it as \"... totally oriental... it would fit well in Baghdad or Damascus\". The bell tower is an example of Norman architecture.\nChiesa della Martorana: Also known as Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio (St Mary of the Admiral), the church is annexed to the next-door church of San Cataldo and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original layout was a compact cross-in-square (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern apses adjoin directly to the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture. The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church. The interior decoration is elaborate, and includes Byzantine mosaics.\nSan Cataldo: Church, on the central Piazza Bellini, which is a good example of Norman architecture.\nSanta Maria della Gancia\nSanta Caterina: This church is located behind Piazza Pretoria and built between 1566 and 1596 in the baroque style.\nSanta Maria della Catena: This church was built between 1490\u20131520. Designed by Matteo Carnilivari: The name derives from chains that were once attached to one of the walls.\nSan Domenico: Located near Via Roma, it is known as the \u201cPantheon of illustrious Sicilians\u201d.\nSan Giuseppe dei Teatini: Located near the Quattro Canti, it is an example of Sicilian Baroque.\nOratorio di San Lorenzo Working in stucco, Rococo sculptor Giacomo Serpotta, his brother Giuseppe and his son Procopio, decorated the church (1690/98\u20131706) with such a profusion of statuary, and an abundance of putti, the walls appear alive. In October 1969, two thieves removed Caravaggio's Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence from its frame. It has never been recovered.\nOratorio del Rosario: Completed by Giacomo Serpotta in (1710\u201317)\nSanta Teresa alla Kalsa, which derives its name from Al-Khalisa, an Arabic term meaning elected, was constructed between 1686-1706 over the former Emir's residence, is one of the best examples of Sicilian Baroque. It has a single, airy nave, with stucco decorations from the early 18th century.\nSanta Maria dello Spasimo was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired Raphael to paint his famous Sicilia's Spasimo, now in the Museo del Prado. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.\nChurch of the Gesu (Church of Jesus): Located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of Basilian monks. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the frescos. The interior has a Latin cross plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in St Anne's Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.\nSan Francesco di Assisi: this church was built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an earthquake. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa\u00e7ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in Renaissance style, as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by Antonio, Giacomo Gagini and Francesco Laurana. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.\nChurch of the Magione: Officially known as the church of the Holy Trinity. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the Cistercian monks.\n\n\n=== Squares and public monuments ===\n\nQuattro Canti is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (mandamenti). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa\u00e7ades so the square has an almost octagonal form.\nPiazza Pretoria was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by Francesco Camilliani, the Fontana Pretoria.\nThe monument to Charles V on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631.\n\n\n=== City walls ===\n\nPalermo has at least two rings of city walls, many pieces of which still survive. The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city \u2013 the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east\u2013west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo.\nIn the medieval period the walled city was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east\u2013west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner there was a defence, Castello a Mare, to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at Santa Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porta Nuova.Several gates in the city wall survive. Images of the wall can be seen here.\n\n\n=== Opera houses ===\n\nUp until the beginning of 20th century there were hundreds of small opera theatres known as magazzeni in the city of Palermo.\n\nThe Teatro Massimo (\"Greatest Theatre\") was opened in 1897. It is the biggest in Italy (8,000 m2, 86,000 sq ft), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Paris Opera and the Vienna State Opera), renowned for its perfect acoustics. Enrico Caruso sang in a performance of La Gioconda during the opening season, returning for Rigoletto at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.\nThe Teatro Politeama was built between 1867 and 1874.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe cathedral has a heliometer (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, la Meridiana, on the floor, running precisely north\u2013south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year.\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of time and the calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24\u2011hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to know when the vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter.\nThe Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo Botanical Garden), founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of 10 hectares (25 acres).\nOne site of interest is the Capuchin Catacombs, with many mummified corpses in varying degrees of preservation.\nClose to the city is the 600-metre-high (2,000 ft) Monte Pellegrino, offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.\nAnother good panoramic viewpoint is the promontory of Monte Gallo (586 m, 1,923 ft), near Mondello Beach.Moreton Bay fig of >30 m girth and of 32m height can be found on the Piazza Marina. This Ficus macrophylla is most probably the thickest tree in Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ===\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites include the Palazzo Reale with the Cappella Palatina, the Chiesa di San Giovanni degli Eremiti, the Chiesa di Santa Maria dell\u2019Ammiraglio, the Chiesa di San Cataldo, the Cattedrale di Palermo, the Palazzo della Zisa and the Ponte dell\u2019Ammiraglio. This makes Italy the country with the most UNESCO world heritage sites, and Sicily the region hosting the most within Italy.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, there were 1.2 million people living in the greater Palermo area, 655,875 of which resided in the City boundaries, of whom 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female. People under age 15 totalled 15.6% compared to pensioners who composed 17.2% of the population. This compares with the Italian average of 14.1% people under 15 years and 20.2% pensioners. The average age of a Palermo resident is 40.4 compared to the Italian average of 42.8. In the ten years between 2001 and 2010, the population of Palermo declined by 4.5%, while the population of Italy, as a whole, grew by 6.0%. The reason for Palermo's decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and to Northern Italy. The current birth rate of Palermo is 10.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.3 births.\nAs of 2006, 97.79% of the population was of Italian descent. The largest immigrant group came from South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka): 0.80%, other European countries (mostly from Albania, Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia and Ukraine): 0.3%, and North Africa (mostly from Tunisia): 0.28%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nEvidence of human settlement in the area now known as Palermo goes back to at least the Mesolithic period, perhaps around 8000 BC, where a group of cave drawings at nearby Addaura from that period have been found.  The original inhabitants were Sicani people who, according to Thucydides, arrived from the Iberian Peninsula (perhaps Catalonia).\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nIn 734 BC the Phoenicians, maritime traders from northern Canaan, built a small settlement on the natural harbor of Palermo, which became known as Ziz (Punic: \ud802\udd11\u202c\ud802\udd09\ud802\udd11, \u1e62Y\u1e62). It became one of the three main Phoenician colonies of Sicily, along with Motya and Soluntum. However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.\nThe first settlement is known as Paleapolis (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"Old City\", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis (\u039d\u03b5\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) or \"New City\". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab al-qa\u1e63r (castle, stronghold, see also alc\u00e1zar). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street (decumanus), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.\nCarthage was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement P\u00e1normos (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"all port\" due to its large anchorage, from which the present name of the city developed. The Phoenicians began using the Greek name on the city's coinage from the 5th century BC. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 BC the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275 BC. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several Germanic tribes. The first were the Vandals in 440 AD under the rule of their king Geiseric. The Vandals had occupied all the Roman provinces in North Africa by 455 establishing themselves as a significant force. They acquired Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily shortly afterwards. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic conquest under Theodoric the Great began in 488; Theodoric supported Roman culture and government unlike the Germanic Goths. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. Sicily was the first part of Italy to be taken under control of General Belisarius who was commissioned by Eastern Emperor. Justinian I solidified his rule in the following years.\n\nThe Arabs took control of the island in 904, and the Emirate of Sicily was established. Muslim rule on the island lasted for about 120 years. Palermo (Bal'harm during Arab rule) displaced Syracuse as the capital of Sicily. It was said to have then begun to compete with C\u00f3rdoba and Cairo in terms of importance and splendor. For more than a hundred years Palermo was the capital of a flourishing emirate.  The Arabs also introduced many agricultural crops which remain a mainstay of Sicilian cuisine.\n\nAfter dynastic quarrels however, there was a Christian reconquest in 1072. Normans conquered Palermo after a long siege. Indeed, the feat proved difficult because the Normans had never besieged such a populous city with such powerful walls. After 5 months siege, Normans built numerous stairs and war machines and finnally conquered the city. The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles, including Robert Guiscard and his army, who is regarded as a hero by the natives.  It was under his nephew Roger II of Sicily that Norman holdings in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula were promoted from the County of Sicily into the Kingdom of Sicily. The kingdom's capital was Palermo, with the King's Court held at the Palazzo dei Normanni. Much construction was undertaken during this period, such as the building of Palermo Cathedral. The Kingdom of Sicily became one of the wealthiest states in Europe.Sicily fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1194. Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor Frederick II. Muslims of Palermo emigrated or were expelled during Holy Roman rule. After an interval of Angevin rule (1266\u20131282), Sicily came under control of the Aragon and Barcelona dynasties. By 1330, Palermo's population had declined to 51,000.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nFrom 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the Kingdom of Spain, and again between 1717 and 1718. Palermo was also under Savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718\u20131720 as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht. It was ruled by Austria between 1720 and 1734.\n\n\n=== Two Sicilies ===\nAfter the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Sicily was handed over to the House of Savoy, but by 1734 it was in Bourbon possession. Charles III chose Palermo for his coronation as King of Sicily. Charles had new houses built for the growing population, while trade and industry grew as well. However, Palermo had become just another provincial city as the Royal Court resided in Naples. Charles' son Ferdinand, though disliked by the population, took refuge in Palermo after the French Revolution in 1798. His son Alberto died on the way to Palermo and is buried in the city.\nWhen the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was founded, the original capital city was Palermo (1816) but a year later moved to Naples.\n\nFrom 1820 to 1848 Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on 12 January 1848, with a popular insurrection, the first one in Europe that year, led by Giuseppe La Masa. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was Ruggero Settimo. The Bourbons reconquered Palermo in 1849, and remained under their rule until the time of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The general entered Palermo with his troops (the \u201cThousands\u201d) on 27 May 1860. After the plebiscite later that year Palermo, along with the rest of Sicily, became part of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861).\n\n\n=== Italian unification and today ===\n\nThe majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoy kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libert\u00e0. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, Ernesto's father, and built by the Rutelli & Mach\u00ec building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.\nDuring the Second World War, Palermo was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces in 1942 and 1943, until its capture during the Allied invasion of Sicily on 22 July 1943. The harbour (main objective of the air attacks) and the surrounding quarters were effectively destroyed, as was a considerable part of the city, with heavy civilian casualties.  When American troops entered Palermo in 1943 they were greeted with \"a thunderous welcome by what seemed the entire population demonstrating their feelings about Facsist rule.\"   The two captured Italian generals claimed that they were happy because in their view \"the Sicilians were not human beings but animals\". Anti-sicilian prejudice was part of the fascist regime's world view, being promoted by pro-fascist newspapers, particularly in the north of Italy.In 1946 the city was declared the seat of the Regional Parliament, as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the Palazzo dei Normanni.\nA theme in the city's modern age has been the struggle against the Mafia, Red Brigades and outlaws such as Salvatore Giuliano, who controlled the neighbouring area of Montelepre. The Italian state effectively has had to share control of the territory, economically and administratively, with the Mafia.\nThe so-called \"Sack of Palermo\" was one of the dramatic consequences of this problem. The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that resulted in the destruction of a great number of historical buildings and green areas, filling the city with poor buildings, mainly between the 1950s and the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.\nThe Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo. A CNN article in July 2019 indicated that Sicilian Mafia activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the town of Passo Rigano. \"According to Italian police, the mafia not only engages in extortion there, but also has a large role in the town's legal economy -- with its involvement in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling.\" The police investigation at the time also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area mafia and American organized crime,  particularly the Gambino crime family. According to La Repubblica, \"Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned\".\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n\n==== Patron saints ====\n\nThe patron saint of Palermo is Saint Rosalia, who is widely revered.\nOn 14 July, people in Palermo celebrate the annual Festino, the most important religious event of the year. The Festino is a procession which goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the Black Death in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a sanctuary marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.\nBefore 1624 Palermo had four patron saints, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were Saint Agatha, Saint Christina, Saint Nympha and Saint Olivia.\nSaint Lucy is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called cucc\u00eca. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.\nSaint Benedict the Moor is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.\nThe ancient patron of the city was the Genius of Palermo, genius loci and numen protector of the place, that became the laic patron of the modern Palermo.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nPalermo hosts a professional football team, Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica Palermo, commonly referred to as simply Palermo, who currently compete in Serie D, having been excluded from Serie B after the 2018\u20132019 season.\nAfter the bankruptcy occurred in the summer of 2019, a new club was formed by the company Hera Hora Srl.\nThe Targa Florio was an open road endurance car race held near Palermo. Founded in 1906, it used to be one of the oldest sports car racing events until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns but has since run as a rallying event. Palermo was home to the grand depart of the 2008 Giro d'Italia. The initial stage was a 28.5-kilometre-long (17.7 mi) TTT (Team Time Trial).\nThe Internazionali Femminili di Palermo is an annual ladies professional tennis event held in the city, which is part of the WTA Tour.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nBeing Sicily's administrative capital, Palermo is a centre for much of the region's finance, tourism and commerce. The city currently hosts an international airport, and Palermo's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses. The economy mainly relies on tourism and services, but also has commerce, shipbuilding and agriculture. The city, however, still has high unemployment levels, high corruption and a significant black market empire (Palermo being the home of the Sicilian Mafia).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nPalermo has a local railway called the Palermo metropolitan railway service.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nPalermo's public bus system is operated by AMAT which covers a net area of 340 km (211 mi). About 90 different routes reach every part of the city.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nPalermo has a public tram system finalized in 2015 and operated by AMAT. There are 4 lines:\n\nRoccella \u2014 Central Station\nBorgo Nuovo \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCEP \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCorso Calatafimi \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\n\n\n=== Coaches ===\nThe local coach company, AST, with its coaches totalling 35 lines, links Palermo to all of the main cities in Sicily.\n\n\n=== Palermo Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Palermo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 63 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 48% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.4 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nPalermo is a key intersection on the Sicilian road network, being the junction between the eastern A19 motorway to Trapani, the southeastern A29 to airport and Mazara del Vallo and the southwestern A19 to Catania and A20 to Messina. Palermo is one of the main cities on European route E90. The three main national roads starting from Palermo are the SS113, SS121, SS186 and the SS624.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nPalermo International Airport, known as Falcone-Borsellino Airport (formerly Punta Raisi Airport), is located 32 km (20 mi) west of Palermo. It is dedicated to Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, two anti-mafia judges killed by the mafia in the early 1990s.\nThe airport's rail facility, known as Punta Raisi railway station, can be reached from Palermo Centrale, Palermo Notarbartolo and Palermo Francia railway stations.\nPalermo-Boccadifalco Airport is the second airport of the city.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nThe port of Palermo, founded by the Phoenicians over 2,700 years ago, is, together with the port of Messina, the main port of Sicily. From here ferries link Palermo to Cagliari, Genoa, Livorno, Naples, Tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually. It is also an important port for cruise ships. Traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes (5.5 million short tons) of cargo and 80,000 TEUs yearly. The port also has links to minor Sicilian islands such as Ustica and the Aeolian Islands (via Cefal\u00f9 in summer). Inside the Port of Palermo there is a section known as \"tourist marina\" for sailing yachts and catamarans.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== National rail ===\nThe main railway station of Palermo is Palermo Centrale which links to the other cities of Sicily, including Agrigento, Trapani and Catania, and through Messina and the strait to the rest of Italy. The railways also connect to the Palermo airport with departures every thirty minutes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe local university is the University of Palermo, the island's second oldest university. It was officially founded in 1806, although historical records indicate that medicine and law have been taught there since the late 15th century. The Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo botanical gardens) is home to the university's Department of Botany and is also open to visitors.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns - sister cities ===\nPalermo is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Twin City Trivia ===\nIn Robert Roswell Palmer and Joel Colton's majestic text-book for University education in the subject of history, A History of the Modern World Palermo is used to exemplify the south of Europe in context of the 1848 Revolutions, and Copenhagen for the opposite cardinal direction: \"...from Copenhagen to Palermo and from Paris to Budapest.\" In this manner, Palermo is twinned to Copenhagen and reversed.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nEleonora Abbagnato, ballet dancer\nSimonetta Agnello Hornby, writer\nMario Balotelli, footballer\nMario Bardi, painter\nPaolo Borsellino, judge\nBruno Caruso, painter, illustrator, graphic designer and political activist\nMarco Cecchinato, tennis player\nGiovanni Falcone, judge\nFranco Franchi, actor\nPietro Grasso, magistrate and President of the Senate\nCiccio Ingrassia, actor\nUgo La Malfa, politician\nLouise of Orl\u00e9ans, Queen of The Belgians\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies, Queen of Spain\nSergio Mattarella, president of Italy\nVittorio Emanuele Orlando, Prime Minister of Italy\nAmelia Pinto, opera singer\nSalvatore Schillaci, footballer\nEnzo Sellerio, photographer, publisher, and collector\nGiacomo Serpotta, sculptor\nGiuseppe Serpotta, sculptor\nAntonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin\u00ec, Prime Minister of Italy\nGiuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, writer\nDelia Vaccarello (1960-2019), journalist and activist for LGBT rights\n\n\n=== Honorary citizens ===\nPeople awarded the honorary citizenship of Palermo are:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOutline of Palermo\nArab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale\nList of mayors of Palermo\nHugo Falcandus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nSee also: Bibliography of Palermo\n\nAppleton, D (2005).

          "Loud, colorful, diverse, tasty, multicultural,vibrant, rich, fun... this is the essence of Sicilian culture in Palermo. Dont miss it even if you are not interested in food market. I recommend to visit it early in the morning before gets crowded. I was on an 8 hour Palermo visit",
          "Mercato is ok, but You can buy all this friuts and vegetables everywhere in every corner in Palermo, I try street food there - be carefully, they do not care about taste and freshnes, is better to eat in restaurant.",
          "If you want to see competition this market has heaps of stall holders trying to win your business.Most stalls are food oriented mostly fruit and vegetables but also lots of fish meat cheese stalls too.Surprisingly very few bakery style stalls.But absolutely bustling",
          "If you are interested in getting in touch with local customs related to daily purchasing of fresh food...",
          "This place is not set up nor even tries to cater to tourists. That\u2019s not the point, you go there to experience how locals shop, see some amazingly interesting fruits, veggies, and watch interesting Italians do there thing. Our boat was in the harbor for a month and this was",
          "Absolute madness, this the market you all want to see. It's loud, colourful, vibrant, exciting. The stall holders seem to have their own language which they vell at the top of their lungs, it's brilliant. Probably not for the squeamish or the p.c health patrols but it a real",
          "Didn\u2019t find this market very atmospheric or interesting. It\u2019s just a regular local market with vegetables and clothing and necessary kitchen items. The bars and cafes weren\u2019t very appealing and the fish we had in one wasn\u2019t great. Maybe we went a little late in the afternoon to",
          "This market is famous for the Palermo Street food and was on our \u201cmust list\u201d but we left without eating a thing. The spleen sandwich is a local delicacy but the smells of the fresh fish sold every few feet killed my appetite. The rest of the street food is mostly fried and quite",
          "I really don\u2019t know what some people are expecting . Sure Sicily is very hot in the summer so don\u2019t expect air conditioning here . It\u2019s really about fruits and meat and the locals come here to buy . Yes it\u2019s loud but you knew this before you came . That is what makes the market",
          "Packed, loud, crowded and really hot (much hotter than the streets around it). Definitely don't take anyone with sensory issues!! Fruit, veg, some street food and a load of tourist tat is what's for offer.",
          "In Palermo there are three old tipical Market: Ballaro', Capo and Vucciria. A lot of people every day crowd the markets to buy food and other things.",
          "In a July 38 degrees Celsius heat, we made our way to find the market and get a taste of the famous Palermo Street Food. What a disappointment. Many fruits and vegetables stands/store, 3 or 4 stands/restaurants with pre-fried fish and pre-fried arancini. Nothing typical,",
          "You can buy any fresh food you want - fish, shellfish, meat, cooked food, vegetables fruit. The market stretches over such a long area and is full of activity and things to buy, even non-edible things. I wished I had been staying in a self-catering apartment so that I could buy",
          "Beware all markets called Mercato in Italian. Your hotel or b&b host may recommend you shop there but I advise you against it. Watch for pickpockets and petty thieves. Also, merchants know you are not from there, so prepare to pay a premium for the goods you buy. Choose a",
          "Took a walk through as we had a couple of hours spare. It's busy and buzzing in places. Excellent displays of fruit, veg, meat and a huge variety of fish. Some of the traders of gifty items charge more than tourist shops though, beware!",
          "Everything you would expect in a market. Lots of fish, fish mongers, tourists, daily shoppers. The main areas are busy with lots of people. There are some sit down restaurants toward the end of the market. An easy walk from the train station.",
          "This market has been here since time immemorial - and it shows.If you have any interest in traditional Italian food,then this place is a must visit. The stalls straggle along a series of old cobbled streets, selling fruit,vegetables, meats, cheeses, spices - the goes on. Several",
          "Palermo is a great city with plenty to do. However I must have missed a trick here, but these markets did not feel special at all. To the extent I would say food markets in Birmingham are better. Maybe we went at a bad time (Saturday after lunch), but we walked through it all in",
          "Then you will love this one. This is essentially a food market selling fruits, veggies, meat and seafood. Bi It it\u2019s not just selling this stuff but how it\u2019s sold that makes it interesting. The spruikers call out at the top of their voices trying to attract you attention. See",
          "We were disappointed with this market. It appeared to be a market for locals, selling everything but it was dirty and we actually felt uneasy walking around due to males just hanging about. Not somewhere I'd revisit or recommend particularly.",
          "I can't compare this to other markets in Palermo, but I can compare it to other markets in Europe. It is good but not necessarily mind-blowing. If you've never been to a food market than I would definitely recommend it, otherwise not a must-see. Hard to get photos as it's",
          "Lovely place if you\u2019re a foodie like me and my partner. You can try lots of different things in small portions, some places even give you free tasters. Great way to try different typical dishes in a short time for small money. Also lovely selection of fresh fruits (and fresh",
          "Sprawling bustling Palermo's largest street market with fruit, vegetables, meat and one eye-catching smiling fish-monger stood with cleaver behind massive slabs of tuna and nearly half a swordfish. Noisy as some stall-holders shout out their wares. Occasionally, a scooter",
          "We found lots of interesting fish and ingredients as well as some very good value kitchen equipment. yes a bit grubby but a peck of dirt is important.",
          "Local markets are the places you have to go to see the real place. The ordinary Palermos. But what a dirty place no garbage taken away and the prices where just cheating.",
          "The Mercato Ballaro differed from the other markets we visited in Sicily as it was much more diverse with international foods and lots of loud hawking of their wares by the vendors. Many of them were speaking the Sicilian dialect. Since we were staying in a hotel, we didn't",
          "We visited on a drizzly, rainy morning, but that did not seem to diminish the enthusiasm of the market sellers or their customers. We arrived by mid morning, when most of the stalls were already set up. We enjoyed the banter back and forth as the sellers hawked their wares,",
          "Give it a try and get lost through the diversity! I really loved this place because of its mixture and we found there everything we needed, we enjoyed the local food and even the crowd. It is really nice to see how people take mercato so serious in a world full of markets and",
          "We visited Mercato Ballero almost daily while staying in the Historic district of Palermo. Everything was fresh and we enjoyed varieties of meats, cheeses, vegetables and fruits. There are also many wonderful spices for gifts and make a great addition to bring some \"Sicily\"",
          "There were so many stalls selling everything from vegetables, bread, fish, bread and even Indian vegetables!! I was amazed to see the Indian vegetables! There were vendors singing and selling their wares! Crowded and a proper market.",
          "A lively market with stalls selling everything from fruit, vegetables, fish and cheeses to household goods and tools. Interesting to wander through and experience the life of Palermo.",
          "This was a busy spot when we arrived . Fabulous variety of fresh produce and fish and meats. Great spot to pick up some lovely fruit and breads.",
          "La vita Bella market full of atmosphere and street food buzzing place well worth a visit whilst in Palermo",
          "This market has fresh products in good prices. Is worth it to shop for breakfast or even a nice liht meal.",
          "I always visit the local markets in Europe. Ballaro market didn't disappoint. Table after table of fresh fish, olives, vegetables, herbs, and many other items. The locals go daily to buy their food for the day. Its exciting to watch the venders interact with the customers.",
          "A sensory delight. We did the market as part of a walking tour. The colours were magnificent and the sizes of the fruit and vegetables was exceptional. We were happy to watch Swordfish being butchered and were given a taste of local made sweets. Overall an exceptional visit.",
          "Go here or Capo not the vanishing Vuccheria despite old guide books. Mix of tat and market goods for residents. Fruit and veg sellers particularly egalitarian and will sell nice tomatoes to anyone. Other stall holders seem to have an eye for the tourist mark and aim to palm",
          "Our host recommended a visit here. It was an amazing experience, mingling with the local people shopping. It is a big market, stretching along several streets, noisy, but we felt as if we were experiencing the true exssence of Palermo. So many stalls, such cheap fresh produce,",
          "Historic but not special. Looked like any number of flea markets around the world. I was hoping for more, but was disappointed. Had it not been raining, maybe we would have enjoyed it more, but i felt the market in Catania was just as good.",
          "We were staying in small self-catering apartment and so were wanting to find fresh produce to cook. This is a huge, rambling market and sells just about everything, not only veg, fruit, fresh meat and fish but also all sorts of household things. I had been warned that it is",
          "this was the third market we visited in Palermo, it was busy, some tourists as well, people shouting their goods, prices are fine, but just beware of the street food, it is expensive, they charge more than they deserve for what they serve, the so called street restaurantes are",
          "Typical Sicilian market with all the foids you could eish for from fruit and vegetables to meat and fish and not forgetting olives! Wish we had markets like this in the UK!",
          "Passed through here just before lunch, and saw a real variety of food and drink stalls, Very bright and vibrant. Only concern was for safety of my son, who did not like having to be moved away from the constant stream of passing scooters.",
          "We came down the street from the city center and admired all the different produce, especially fruit and seeds and olives. We had some sardines as well, very tasty.",
          "I love the markets in Palermo, they are really Sicilian ones. You can find here fresh food and you can feel the rhythm of the local people. We bought here really fresh fish and shrimps, and also vegetables. If you just want to feel the taste of Sicily you have to go and visit",
          "Even on Sunday, when the market is closed, you'll find several restaurants with delicious seafood and the best al dented pasta. Palermo has really great food,",
          "Great place to visit the the colours the smells were fantastic, the fruit and fish have to be experienced would never shop in the supermarket !!!",
          "What a vibrant Market selling fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, spices, pasta, cheese, bread. You can eat your way round Sicily. Lots of stalls cooking fish, Sausage,street food to buy and taste. Husband particularly liked the freshly cooked octopus. Shoes, clothing,",
          "You can buy food, drink, clothes, chinese and even pictures of flowers or Jesus if you like (see one of my pictures). It\u2019s colorful, loud and crowded rather touristic than local but worth to see anyway if you are already in Palermo. If you want to taste local, street food",
          "Mercato Ballaro is a very lively and interesting place full of curiosities. One of the beating hearts of Palermo.",
          "We hit all 3 during our stay and this was the best- certainly in terms of food and number of vendors. Saw veggies never see in the States and all sorts of fresh fish. Easy just to wander and watch the locals shop. Lots going on even on a weekday. If limited on time I would start",
          "This farmer's market is incredible, but I love farmers' markets. The sea-life, fruits and vegetables are beautifully piled everywhere. The sellers are constantly yelling, singing, entertaining. Lots of sellers shout, \"Dai, dai, dai dai!\" Which means, \"Please, please, c'mon,",
          "Palermo's Ballar\u00f2 market is crazy, full of smells (many good and some not so good), crowded, loud and on the verge of being extremely chaotic. But isn't that what you would expect from a market in Palermo? I found it fun and exciting to visit. A chance to see Palermo and the",
          "Every city has a great market like this one. A chance to see what is happening on the local food front. Fish and meat, veg and fruit. Olives, salamis and cheese. Try the sheep ricotta with varying flavours, have a granita if it's hot ( or even if it's only warm !) stop for a",
          "Just resign yourself to getting lost and becoming a little disoriented in this vast marketplace whose parameters are kind of nebulous. It is reminiscent of a North African souk. It begins about half a mile south of Palazzo Reale and spits you out somewhere around the Central",
          "ballaro market is a foodie's dream, so many stalls with the stall holders calling to each other or competing, sounded like parrots. amazing vegetables, fish and seafood, ricottas, salamis stands that stretch out over many streets and alleyways. you can buy great chickpea",
          "We visited on a busy Saturday morning and were amazed at the variety and quality of produce on offer. Local farmers were alongside butchers, fishmongers and olive sellers. I have never seen bigger Tuna fish and some of the vegetables had to be seen to be believed. We were",
          "This market offers a great selection of food depending on what is in season. It has a real vibe about it and market holders will let you try the produce. See the the real Palermo by walking along the whole of the market. Fresh fish, cheese and a whole section of fruit/veg.",
          "Honestly can't understand how anybody gave this place a good review. The market was dirty and smelly and to be honest my partner felt unsafe. Relieved to get away from the place.",
          "We visited the market on a sunny Friday morning. It was lots of fun to see the locals doing their shopping and hearing the market vendors cry out special offers in Italian. Lots of different things to have a look at. A must do!",
          "I loved everything about this street market. The selection and prices were amazing and I felt that I was an Italian citizen shopping for my household just for a moment.",
          "We were staying just a couple of blocks away from this interesting street market, but the first day we had trouble finding it since the streets are little alley ways with no marked names. But once we finally found it it was a great experience. You have to go early in the morning",
          "... and too smelly and chaotic. It is a place to visit if you enjoy crowds and if you want to buy something convenient, although my idea of standing in a disorderly queue is not my idea of convenience or fun.",
          "Even if you are not planning on buying fruits and vegetables the Mercato Ballaro is a fun place to walk through. The produce always looks great and is interesting to compare prices and products. Since you will be out strolling around to take in your next sightseeing location,",
          "Ballar\u00f2 market is one of the most famous market in Italy. It is a mix of colors, smells, aromas, flavors and voices. It's a unique chaos, sometimes there are few people and you can watch the vendors with no stress.",
          "We go to this market every time we visit Palermo. Most probably best one in Sicily. Selection of local produce including cheeses , vegetables, seafood and meat at good prices. Worth visiting.",
          "We were staying in Palermo in a self catering apartment as I like to buy the local produce and cook it. Ballero is one of three markets in Palermo open every day as far as I could make out. I enjoyed walking through it with no idea what to cook until I got inspiration from the",
          "The owner seems friendly at first, singing and joking and happy to give you free samples. But wait until you pay! He charged 10 euros for 1 jar of ricotta di bufala. Ricotta di bufala (buffalo) is in general more expensive than sheep or cow; however, the very best one is still",
          "We stumbled upon this area by chance, real lively a colourful market . Gorgeous produce ... fresh artichoke and beautiful fruit and vegetables . Wonderful displays of fish and meat as well.",
          "Our private driver introduced this small market to us, at the end of our journey. The market is an authentic and amazing place to see what the Sicilians eat and buy. Wide variety of food and product is sold here, fruits, fish, bread, pizza etc. for some euros We tasted",
          "We toured Mercato Ballaro while in Palermo twice, once by ourselves at night and during a guided tours during the day. The market is a wonderful place to see what the Sicilians eat and buy. We were surprised on the wide variety of produce being sold and how diverse the produce",
          "A place the tourist should avoid. Contrary to what some reviews say this is not Sicilian culture. First of all it is almost impossible to find a parking space. Then if you manage to find one you would end up in this market walking among people selling rags and second hand",
          "This was the largest market we saw in Palermo and I just loved it. It was very vibrant and lots of banter and shouting from the local sellers. There was a good selection of street food and we tried a plate of Sicilian cheese and sausage. There was a good selection of fish,",
          "Mercato Ballaro is by far the best market in Palermo. You can find everything from fresh produce, meat, spices, pasta and various knickknacks. The colors, the smells, the ambiance and the merchants make it a unique experience. You can also eat on site and taste some of the great",
          "A rather small street market, few places to eat and not impressive at all, if you have spare time you can go , otherwise go somewhere else.",
          "The largiest and, in my opinion, the loveliest market in the city centre: surely better than the socalled \"mercato della Vucciria\", that is so famous mainly because of the fine, homonymous painting by Renato Guttuso, now (August 2017) shown in an exhibition in the Palazzo dei",
          "Very underwhelming local market. Went a second time to make sure I hadn't missed anything, but really not sure why some people go on about it. It really isn't anything special. Most small towns in France have a bigger and more exciting weekly market. The fish stalls are",
          "Horrible, dirty and nothing special. If you know what vegetables look like, and don't want to see dirty fish out in the sun then I wouldn't bother with this place. The locals fighting in street finished me off..",
          "After being almost a week on a ship, a cute little market was just what I needed. I walked around for a little while, buying some nuts and fruits which tasted excellent. I see that the place has gotten some not so good reviews, but I think it depends on your expectations. I",
          "Just interesting to walk through. Not worth a special trip. Those whonhave been to North African souks or Asian markets will be deceived.",
          "The food was not fresh. There were not that many restaurant or a great variaty of vegetables and fruit. We ate there and moat of the food was left on the plates. Would not recomment it to anyone!",
          "All of the travel guides rave about Ballaro Market, so maybe I was expecting too much, but this market was completely underwhelming. Wasted a lot of time trying to find it, because the maps were unclear, but when we finally found it, in the middle of a run-down section of the",
          "Markets are open 7 days - then at night the stalls close and the area becomes \"party central plus eateries. This is the place to see Sicilian life at its best . Huge market site selling anything and everything editable - crazy jumble of stalls with lots of noisy spruiking by the",
          "Much to see in the Ballaro market. Typical large seaside market with lots of seasonal veg, fruit, fish, meat. Crowded & busy! The octopus fast food stand was great! Visit!",
          "This is a living, breathing open air market in the best tradition. Fresh produce, seafood, meat and to top it off--Sicilian street food! But there is more, street vendors selling all kinds of everyday items for the home. I got two aprons in azzurri blue made by local",
          "This market is not the place to don your finest. Be casual, leave your valuables in the hotel safe and begin your journey into the past. Here, at the Ballar\u00f2 Street Market, you'll find yourself stepping into the Twilight Zone of Palermo's history. You'll never again see a more",
          "This was the second market we had been to that day. We went to the so called big tourist market called Vuccario but frankly it was a waste of time. It is not big and not touristy. Even the waiter at the bar said that it has shrunk nowadays. So we went to Mercato Ballaro which",
          "When we arrived in Palermo Cruise Terminal we took a taxi van. The taxi driver, in more than 3 hours, drove us along many places in Palermo. One of these places was Mercato Ballaro. A market for the sale of fish, fruit and vegetables, all displayed in colourful stalls. See some",
          "We went to that so called street market thinking that we would find street food, as local specialities such as arancini, cannoli, etc. but they dont really have street food. It is basically a street market in which local producers or re sellers sells their goods. So mostly you",
          "We loved our visits to this lively market. We stayed in an apartment in Palermo and bought lunch there. Motzarella, tomatoes, olives, basil, bread and wine. The merchants are super friendly. The fish displays are incredible and the sausages, salamis mouth-watering. A great,",
          "Big city market, very busy. I was surprised that I could not find the fruit that I wanted there. Not especially interesting, but worth a short stroll. Go to the monuments and museums instead.",
          "It was just ok, underwhelmed and not well organized. It was supposed to be one of the better ones in Palmero. The smaller fish market at Catania was more enjoyable.",
          "I found this market very usual. Vegetables, fish, cheese, olives etc. Nothing special. If you need to get some groceries - thats a place. If you looking for some authentic stuff - try something else.",
          "Good to see the amazing produce and the vibrancy of the market as they provide insights into life in Palermo! We wish we were in an apartment so that we could have an opportunity to use the fantastic seafood, vegetables and fruit in a feast.",
          "Either if you want to buy something or just enjoy the bright colors of fruits and vegetables, you must visit this place if you want to get in touch with the other side of the Palermo culture, besides the churches and palaces and museums. The street life is full of views, smells,",
          "Great big market full of fresh fruit and vegetables, spices, delis. Busy atmosphere with stall owners yelling and people everywhere. Really good experience. Also good place to buy food, prices are cheap",
          "We had seen the other main markets before this and most of the produce, fish, and other goods looked quite similar. We then entered a place where there were murals and very quickly felt unsafe and came upon so much trash everywhere and seedy looking people rooting through",
          "My wife and I visited Mercato Ballaro on a random Wednesday and it was rainy and overcast but the vendors were open and ready for business. Its worth a visit but I was not impressed over Mercato del Capo. We only walked through and didn't haggle much about buying from vendors",
          "At Ballaro market you can see and feel real South Italian spirit. Fresh vegetables and fruits everywhere, lot's of scooters passing, street food and spices.",
          "If you like spitting fighting burping and dri and smells this is the place to be ..stall holders sneezing all over their goods ..disgusting place",
          "Worst meal of a 6 week trip. Ordered pasta bianca with salmon and was served chopped meat... there were TWO dishes with SAME name!! They were reluctant to correct so we let it go. Pizza was overpriced and tasted very cheap. Souvenirs looked like they were all 'made in China',",
          "If you want a huge variety of food, spices, cheap clothes and accessories, this is definitely the right market for you. Our hosts told us more about the other 2 (vucchiara and capo). The first one is great at night time for its street food and the second one quieter and smaller",
          "You could almost find anything in this market: from souvenirs to fish; from wine to cheeses ! Prices are affordable. The best thing about it, is the authenticity of the people, their screams, their bids, their laughter and the fusion of colors :)",
          "I was in Palermo for eight days, and for several of those days prepared my own meals with fresh, wonderful and very affordable ingredients I bought at this market. What was best too, is that it was only a few blocks from where I stayed. Perfect! The market has everything from",
          "I loved it and went several times as it was not far from where we were staying. I bought eggs, tomatoes, olives, cheeses, butter. Enjoyed watching all the \"action\". We also took the walking food tour, and our guide brought us here so we learned where to get fabulous arrancina",
          "Don t eat there,4 shrimp are 5 e,it is really dirty,there is a lot of sea food,the bill on a piece of paper and we payed more then we ate.",
          "People when u write that Vucchiria market or Capo are the best this is not true. The only unique experience we had after visiting the 3 of them was in Ballaro- close to Central station. Many stands with fresh seafood, meat, cheeses and of course fruits and vegetables but also",
          "A real itialian market where lots of people go shopping their meat, fish, vegetables, fruites and spices. It is very colorful and you ll see a lot of things. Small restaurants are located there and you can have fresh fish dishes or taste fresh fruits. Many residents eat their",
          "Loved this experience. Vendors signing out their prices, people grilling intestines, women arguing about prices. A rich mix of history, flavors, sights and sounds. I didn't buy anything but it was fun to people watch.",
          "Where locals and tourists collide with the freshest foods, seafood and meat and herbs and fruits and vegetables, olives and almonds and spices; clothing; tchotchkes of various souvenir worthiness; street food and the mix of people and sounds that make markets just a great spot",
          "We went yesterday with eagerness to this market but we're really disappointed. Firstly do not expect anything like the European markets in Spain, France or Germany. The Italian markets are much less sophisticated and don't have much in the way of cooked take home food. The",
          "We went to the Balaro market a couple times during our recent stay in Palermo. This is a good place to feel a part of everyday life in Sicily. There were many shops for meats, seafood, vegetables and spices. We bought quite a bit to bring home as souvenirs. The street foods",
          "In addition to being \"museum freaks\" we are \"market freaks\". Wherever we are in the world.....markets are are go to. Ballaro did not disappoint. The fresh ginger was gorgeous......the WHITEST mushrooms were a feast for the eyes.....fab looking eggplant....zucchini in all",
          "A great market for lots of fresh food especially fish and olives. I agree with some other reviewers and certain parts of the market seemed a little dirty, but having not seen any other markets in Sicily I can't compare... It mostly seemed fine to me. Everyone that served us was",
          "I get a sense of dred at the idea of returning as I was nearly hit multiple times by barely legal mopeds driven by children. BE CAREFUL OF THE CRAZY DRIVERS! The markets closed very early however the produce on offer was great. I really found it to be quite the melting pot with",
          "You will be undecided between taking tons of pictures of the colourful and lively place and atmosphere and tasting all the specialties offered by this varied and genuine market. Take your time to absorb all its smells, scenes and never-ending \"song-like\" shouts of the sellers",
          "I never saw anything quite like this place except in Morrocco. Would I ever go alone? Never, but my husband is from Palermo and did feel very safe. You can buy anything and everything for the house, kitchen, etc., etc., I could have spent all day in there and wish I could",
          "What a great market. We were only going to buy a few things for antipasti but there Were so many choices of vegetables Fruits, cheeses, seafood that we ended up buying enough food & wine for dinner",
          "This is a great lovely market. Although perhaps not the largest or most beautiful market in the world it is among the liveliest, melodic and active markets to be found. Meander thru, my wife and I felt safe and try some of the great street food, fried large round rice balls",
          "Quite large and interesting, but from a tourist standpoint, unless you are staying nearby and have a kitchen of no value. Many other markets are superior. Spices available. When you get to the end of the main market, turn around and go back, do not go to the rest of the market",
          "This is an authentic market with the authentic market atmosphere-people shouting out saying who knows what to attract customers to their stalls, fish and animal carcasses being skinned and chopped in every direction. The produce, the people, the theatrics and the colours made me",
          "I've been to produce markets in several countries, but this is something else! Great fruit and veggies, of course, but this really is food as theater: men with big knives chopping and skinning and yelling loudly. Not for the squeamish - there are skinned animal bodies hanging",
          "Took a cab here from Mercurre Palermo Excelsior to do some local shopping. Was a cold, drizzly morning but had fun looking at local food products. Bought some nuts, candy, olive oil, fresh strawberries, sundried tomatoes. Great experience. Negotiated with cab drivers for the",
          "The Vucciria is a great place but Ballaro is the ultimate street market in Palermo. This is what people talk about when they say Palermo is closer to Africa than to Europe. It's load, it's busy, it's very cheap. You walk around wishing you had a kitchen and a house full of",
          "A sprawling market for locals to do their daily shopping. There were lots of carts of seafood including baccala` (salted cod, a typical dish for the region) and vongole (clams), fruits (some juicy looking strawberries), and veggies, in particular carciofi (artichokes) and",
          "If you are in market atmosphere, love colourful stands with local production, you will like the place. If you are not market lover, it is just the market like the others. We liked all the markets in Palermo and could not say which is the best :) the are all alike.",
          "Ballaro market seems to be the most popular of the three street markets in Palermo. You seem to just turn up a street and before you know it you're there. We turned left and seemed to just follow the stalls through to the other side. Afterwards we felt that we must have only",
          "So I was reading that this market was open later than others, and at about 9:00 i said hey, why don't i go get some night life street food. I started walking there and the neighbourhood started to slowly feel less and less friendly before i arrived in the market, where i",
          "Nothing special Just another food market. Los of fruits and fresh seafood. The vendors are very friendly.",
          "Avalanche of sites, smells and sounds. Fish, veggies, fruit, meat and some take away food. Useless to buy unless you have a kitchen but unforgetable.",
          "One of my favorite stops in Palermo. I can spend hours wandering the alleys and taking photos. It is loud, smells, gritty, colorful and full life. Most vendors can immediately identify a tourist. I have lived in Italy over five years and still look like a \"straniera.\" If you",
          "Today's Sunday, so we weren't sure if the Ballaro Market would be operating. We'd read conflicting reports that they were open on Sundays, were only open in the morning on Sundays, or weren't open at all. Well they were definitely open when we got there around midday, and doing",
          "This is a great market and if I lived here I'm certain I would be a regular customer. The seafood looked like it had just been caught. There was even a stand selling live giant snails. Another had some exotic looking eel. Well worth a look.",
          "We went to all the main Palermo markets & Ballaro was by far the best. Meat, fish, cheese, spices, fruit, veg, household items & much more. Some of the freshest & largest vegetables I've ever seen! We saw a group that paid for a tour, but why would you when you can easily walk",
          "A lovely market with a wide range of fruit, veg and meat/fish, plus other 'stuff'. A nice market to walk through.",
          "Interesting market with vendors selling fish mostly, but also many other items. Found a bakery with a delicatessen and purchased fresh buns, with Parma ham and italian cheese. Delicious and cheap. Great area to wonder around and not far from the Cathedral.",
          "If you want to experience the true Palermo and buy some freash and delicius produce, go here. It is charming and full of vibriant life.",
          "This market has it all! It's like a little international village with food and vendors from all corners of the globe. There is no dearth of traditional Italian food-stuffs like eggplant, tomatoes, and zucchini. But there are so many other cuisines represented and some very odd",
          "i ordinarily don't like making disparaging comments about places that i have visited. making comparisons to other places is alway poor form. but compared to other markets that i have visited in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam and London Ballaro is a tip. literally a tip.",
          "There are several street markets in Palermo. The Ballaro is one of the oldest. It gives you a flavor for life in Sicily and you can get lunch or a snack at any of several cafes where you can have fresh prawns taken right off of the ice and grilled while you wait.",
          "Ballaro market really was one of the most exciting, noisy, exotic, and colorful and interesting market I walked in. There were hundreds of merchants and a huge diversity of food, especially fish, seafood and veggies. I was really happy here, making photos, speaking with the",
          "Going to the markets in Palermo are a fantastic experience! You don't want to miss Ballaro market, and I highly recommend collecting a picnic while you are there.",
          "When in Palermo don't miss Ballaro!!! It's a topical street market where you can find food, garment and more. It's unbelievable because you are in the heart of Sicily Soul. Don't miss a walk inside it.",
          "We had our boat in Palermo for almost a month and this is where we shopped. Need sausage, they take you behind the counter and let you taste the seasoning. Then they pack it and tie it off to the length you want, only in Palermo! The true experience, find some shade, a cold",
          "Not big, very colorfull. Suggest buing some fruit, which were of a good quality and not a rip-off in the same time. Plenty of seafood - which on the other hand I did not risk buying due to conditions they are often stored in. Generally an interesting experience.",
          "This is a wonderful place to head when in Palermo it is not too far from the Teatro Massimo. It is colourful and noisy and everything that you would expect from a market in Palermo! Wander round, look at the stalls, dodge the scooters and watch the locals, hours of",
          "This is an open air market in various narrow streets in the center of Palermo, not far from the train station. You don't find places like this in Europe and they are disappearing in Asia and Africa. Altogether there are Km of food markets, butcher, vegetables, fish, bread fruit",
          "Tremendous fresh quality and a great variety of fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, sausage, cheese, breads, olives, street foods, and other things related to food. Lots of people, hollering, hawking, laughing, eating and selling. And of course, people like you who are just there",
          "We were here in July 2013th but somehow we missed to visit Balaro. When we realised we were just one street away for a couple of times, while on the central bus/train station, we were even more sorry for not visiting this little piece of true Sicilian atmosphere you can sense on",
          "Take your whole morning to stroll trough the market and enjoy the vivid colours and strong scents of fruits veggies, meat and fresh fish! this was personally one of the best experiences in Palermo, to experience the city and locals, the way of life and decently pick up some",
          "Perhaps it was too late but this was very disappointing and definitely not worth the trouble/visit. If you're from a large city where selling on the street (NYC, Chinatown etc.), this was nothing special. The products were plastic toys and other mass produced items and the food",
          "The food I bought was great, the atmosphere is great as well. There's everything from souvenirs like magnets to fresh fruit, fish, meat, a great variety of cheeses, sweets and beverages. The people who work there are nice and helpful. Beware of pickpockets, though.",
          "The biggest food market in Palermo with a lots of tempting stalls, from fish to veg, olives, meat, olive oil, cheese, fruits...you name it Ballaro has it all, you will surely end up with few shopping bags after visiting this place...the staff are so friendly(screaming a bit loud",
          "A few hundred meters away from the central train station of Palermo, the Ballaro market is one of the oldest and most famous of the city, I visited it one morning while waiting for the train, a walk of about 20-30 minutes from the many scenic and stalls , street vendors, stalls",
          "Here you can still feel the dynamism and excitment of a true traditional market, which is a \"species\" in extinction threated these days by supermarkets as well as shopping malls. A pity! You will also notice the generosity of this fertile Sicilian land and of its seas and will",
          "Loads on offer. Tons to buys, smell and see. We even stopped for lunch to take it all in. Amazing. If you are staying in Palermo self catering do not shop anywhere else for you food!",
          "Liked the food vendors especially the cheese and fruit but was hoping to see crafts of sicily. In stead we saw junk from China very disappointing.",
          "must visit the markets in Palermo...stunning and varied produce with tastes offered by stall owners..lush fresh vegetables fish and fruit",
          "This market was awful. People were not friendly and is not worth visiting. All cafes there rip you off. Waitress accidentally gave us an Italian menu and English menu. English menu was exactly the same except the price was much higher then on what the Italian menu showed!",
          "Many know Vucciria market, but the locals go to Ballaro market! We found Ballaro Market it much more interesting. You can find all kinds of local specialties with shops and cafes along the way. Make sure to have the mini cannolis. Warming, some fish merchants mix old & new",
          "Do all your food and more shopping at Ballaro. Open everyday. Watch your bag. Try all the different things in season. And cheese and olives and more. My children 7 & 9 love it too. Especially if you nibble as you go. Its not too big either",
          "We flew to Palermo and had the chance to hang around for a few hours before getting a train to Cefalu. As the airport transfer bus had driven past all the major architectural sites very slowly in traffic, we had a decent look at them all, so decided to explore the Ballaro Market",
          "To preface this review we love local markets and enjoy seeing the local produce, pastries, meats and especially the fishes. If you want supermarket trappings then this is not your place, though there are more 'organized' shops throughout the market. Wonderfully fresh goods,",
          "We stopped by the market before lunch and enjoyed walking through it and purchasing some fresh fruit and spices as souvenirs for people back home. The fruits were very fresh and delicious.",
          "If you like market streets, then Ballaro is worth a visit. Everything from the everyday things you never get around to buying at home to some decent touristy things. Lots of variety.",
          "In the heart of the old town just off Free to all. We visited in February on a three day stay in the town. We had not sought out the market but came across it wandering the interesting streets. Great atmosphere and colour and interesting to see so much diverse products. A touch",
          "Men shouting to sell their potatoes, fresh swordfish being chopped right there, fruits and veggies and knock off shoes and peoples yard sales- you can find it all here and it's a blast to wander through and try the food. We went on a Sunday morning and it was so lively and",
          "We stumbled on this market while wandering through Palermo one afternoon. The produce selection is remarkable and you will see seafood for sale that is lacking in most major aquariums - let alone your local supermarket.",
          "While other Europeans might be familiar to this style of market, I'm not sure there are many like it in the United States. It's very real, very Palermo, very down-to-earth. If you want a better idea of the real city and not just surface tourism, this is a great place to go.",
          "I have to say we have matkets in the uk and this is nothing special.Just a market selling daily produce. Did not get any sense of sicilian life but bought some cheap cheese to take home. I come from the north of the uk with plenty of markets that are better.",
          "A great place to watch and experience Sicilian life! Be prepared to be squeezed by the crowds and vehicles and also go in proper footwear as the market streets can be wet and slippery.",
          "A loud experience, but not a very big market. There is a difference between the other markets of Catania that sell more clothes and electronics.",
          "This is the place where you can see how different origins mingled into 1 area and soak up the atmosphere. Such markets are already far and few in other parts of the world. Street food in this market such as chickpea fritters, potato herb croquettes were fantastic and the produce",
          "We brought our kids here to enjoy some street food, a cold drink and to soak up some real Palermo atmosphere. Apart from having to dodge a number of motor bikes screaming through the market place, it was a great experience",
          "The real Palermo. Real food, real produce, fresh seafood. This was crowded and noisy and great fun! We managed to get some food - assert yourself or others will push in and you'll stand for ages - we ate freshly cooked whole spiced calamari, chickpea fritters, potato herb",
          "This is where to find the real Palermo...the sights, the smells, the noise, the faces, all the different origins mingled into one area... There are three markets in this city, all of which are amazinf. Sit down, have a cremino, and watch!",
          "This is a place of colours, smells, sounds.I have enjoyed here so much. If you're visiting Palermo than Ballaro Market should be on your visit list. So sorry we didn't eat there, it would be great experiance. We only bought some fruits for later, which was very delicious.",
          "We were told to come and sample the local produce and we tried a local food, pannelli which dates back to Arab times and is only found in Palermo. It is made from chickpea flour which is deep fried and eaten in a roll. Yum and all for the price of an euro. Bargain fruit as well",
          "I loved Ballaro market. It was colourful, lively and there are some real characters. The fresh produce was very tempting. We ate at a fish place which my friends enjoyed. I'm veggie and had the chickpea patty thing which I'd read about previously and it hit the spot on a hot day",
          "You just have to love the life and vibrancy of the open air markets in Sicily. They pulse with life, character and the most wonderful array of fresh vegetables and fruit, seafood, cheeses - all the culinary delights of life.",
          "Everything at your fingertips and of fresh quality. No one seems to want to serve you unless you just stand there and try and make eye contact. If everyone was a little bit more friendly and a little pride taken in their worlplace it would be a magical experience.",
          "The best market I have been so far. Lively, crowded, full of food of all kind. Guides usually recommend Vucciria market which is small and offers much less comparing to Ballaro. We bought good fruit there and took as much photos as we liked - no one bothered. Going to Palermo",
          "Don't go here if you are hungry! If you ignore this advice, you will end up buying much too much of the excellent produce on display in this lively and colourful street market. Eat at one of the many small foodstalls that can be found here. The raw seafood is so fresh that it",
          "We visited markets all over Italy and this one is probably one of the largest ones we've ever visited. A lot going on - alot of fresh fruits, veggies and fish! No issues with prices not being as advertised. I bought a bunch of herbs, dried tomatoes and other stuff with no",
          "A very sad market. The area is shabby, the vendors appear depressed, do not greet the visitors and don't even try to sell or engage the people with their awful looking food often crawling with flies. Seems like it is the same produce table after table although there is a good",
          "If you want to live the authentic sicilian atmosphere, this is the place!A colorful market, full of smells, sounds and food obviously!The visit will take less than one hour and a visit is recommended to Street Food lovers.",
          "After paying 3 visits to this market which is close to where we are staying we realised that the market is not particularly good, and that most shopkeepers will do their best to rip you off. Items that are advertised at a specified price get rung up at higher prices, or the",
          "I enjoyed walking thru the market with our Streat Food Tour..on my own..perhaps I would have gotten a bit lost..?? Maybe not..but it was full of local colour...smells...flavours.. and sights!I do love a good colourful market!!",
          "Local flavor indeed! I wouldn't travel to this neighborhood at night or as an alone female. It was a cornucopia of sights, smells and sounds! Go if you love open air markets but nothing too spectacular.",
          "Be prepared for the hustle and bustle of this authentic market offering all sorts of extremely good value fresh fruit and veg - mostly locally sourced. Apart from the mad cap scooterists who seemed to think it entirely appropriate to barge through narrow crowded streets this",
          "The market is a photographers dream, both for the many wonderful food offerings and for the many characters who play supporting roles as vendors, not to mention the colorful parade of shoppers and browsers. Go be one and buy the makings of a fantastic Sicilian meal, then",
          "Here is the heart of real shopping. You must be there early, meander, listen, look, squeeze and learn how to calculate euros/ kilos.",
          "A very scenic and wonderful market in the open air.Prices can be very cheap and locals know what they want.It,s comparable to Catania,s market in size and produce.",
          "We were here in the fall a couple of years ago. We had intended to visit it but got there even earlier than planned, during a pedicab taxi ride. There were more folks shopping here than at the other markets that we visited. It felt the most working class of all the food markets,",
          "Ballaro Market is my favorit food market in Palermo. Fresh food and good atmosphere. Been there many times since 2007, last time in april 2013.",
          "We walked through the market on our way to the Palazza Normanni. It has all the usual foods and assorted stuff you usually find in markets. We found we had to be careful of the motorcycles that seemed to always come from behind you. We bought some olives to snack on. Doesn't",
          "Our landlady said that the Ballaro was 'dead' as a market - and I would agree. There is very little fresh food there and much was poor quality. All the locals use the Capo not far away which has much more variety and some excellent fresh food..",
          "Makes me sad to think of the exhorbitant pricing and availabilty of fresh produce at home.... The variety of produce combined with the smells and the noise of the sellers hustling their wares is almost intoxicating. Would consider self catering to be able to get the ingredients",
          "Great atmosphere, well worth a visit - even if you are not buying it costs nothing to look. If you are self catering get your fresh produce here! It also possible to buy canned and bottled drinks at very cheap prices. Good for stocking up on beers!",
          "I visited this place few times during my stay in Palermo. It is very vibrant and amazing place to explore typical sicilian cuisine. Fish, vegetables, meat and street food... this is where people from Palermo shop. Do not forget to visit it at night. There are fews pubs with very",
          "Forget about Virruchia market, this is where Palermo shops for their food. Amazing fish market and veggies, meat etc. Mouth was watering as we walked past the stalls. If you're a foodie and love visiting food markets, then you must come here.",
          "I wish we'd been self-catering in palermo after wandering through this fascinating market. It's a photographer's dream and a great place to wander while you eat snacks from the stalls",
          "The Ballaro street market, which runs for 3 blocks, in Palermo is the best of the street markets for food. Fruits, vegies, fish and meat are the strengths here, plus a few stalls selling some general items like spices, cheese, bread and other groceries. Everything is very fresh",
          "Ballaro market was typical of street markets worldwide. Obviously a local favourite for daily produce and miscellaneous products .",
          "A stroll through the market is a great way to spend a morning in Palermo. Amazing sights: beautiful and cheap fruits and vegetables, seafood like you can't imagine. Enjoy the very entertaining vendors and pick up a little snack.",
          "I love going to markets in foreign cities. Whether it's the fun of bartering in Istanbul or seeing how beautifully food is displayed in France, I really enjoy tthem. While there's nothing \"pretty\" about the Ballaro Market, it's fascinating to see the huge fish being expertly",
          "Our hotel was very close to here so we had a lovely walk through the market everyday. There is local fresh fruit and veg as well as fresh fish and meat on offer. As anywhere where fish is on sale there is a fishy aroma however it is not unbearable and most times I hardly noticed",
          "It's in a little alley so don't be nervous to walk back there! Tons of fresh produce and meats. Personally, we didnt buy anything but it was neat to go look and see how people buy their food locally. I would def. go back! :)",
          "If you are one of those tourists who find misery, dirt and derelict \"pictoresque\" you may like it. My heart sinks for the people who live in those conditions. Put away the camera and ask how is it that things have been let so much out of hands.",
          "The market is an experience worth having. We walked on a Saturday morning, and the sights and sounds were a \"cultural experience\" that helped define Palermo for us.",
          "Messy, dirty, smells fish, flies on the fruits and worst thing of all, bikes going through every minute with meat, fish and fruits exposed, I would not have bought a single thing to eat from this market. Streets around have a miserable feel, trash absolutely everywhere,",
          "This place rocks! It is loud and noisy and colorful and full of life. The wares are in your face and I wish I had a kitchen to use so I could buy those huge mushrooms I saw or the strawberries that were stacked up precisely or those olives that had my mouth watering. The smells",
          "Today we bought fresh tomatoes, olives, mozzerala di buffala and a couple of beers, in an ancient market full of singing vendors with home grown produce. This hodge-podge, long, narrow market, is full of people, locals shopping on their Vespas, tourists taking in the sights,",
          "Great market for fruit and veg and particularly fish. If you're shopping for your own cooking best to shop further in as big fish counters near entrance (Station end) seem to cater for restaurant/large quantities buyers.",
          "If this is your first market, it will be great, if it is your fifth, then not-so-great. There is nothing here that sets it apart from plenty of other markets around the world.",
          "If you want to see one of Palermo markets, chose this one. Fish and vegetable stalls, noise and crowd - all as you imagine should be on a southern market. Shame you can buy more as a tourist (unless you chose self catering).",
          "Best market in Palermo. Noisy, atmospheric, cheap, fresh produce. Do all my shopping here and it's a real pleasure every time.",
          "This market was literally just below our hotel room..... nice for a walk... its mostly a food market that at the lower end kind of turns into an almost car boot sale thingy?! the fresh fruit is amazing and soooooooo cheap. its just nice to have a walk and enjoy seeing all the",
          "This is a great market with masses of stalls selling fresh fish and seafood, fruit and vegetables. There are also plent of stalls selling spices and nuts - great things to take home with you! The market is noisy and busy - but that doesn't seem to deter motorcyclists from",
          "If I stayed in apartment or self catering, it would be a great place to go to get all fresh ingredients",
          "The streets of the market stalls are brisk and busy, bustling and rather invigorating, and authentic, but the general atmosphere is a sad one of fallen glory. Unreconstructed World War Two damage dominates the scene, overall, and one gets a sense of an heroic",
          "We visited during February, with virtually no tourists, just Palermitani doing their shopping. In the meat/fish area of the market we saw a very freshly slaughtered lamb ready to be dressed, the head of a very large swordfish lying on the cobblestones and various animal parts I",
          "it was nice to wonder around this market, the fruit and veg are amoungst the cheapest I've seen in italy and looked good quality. there were only men around which could be a bit uncomfortable, but I had nobody bothering me. a nice place to shop or just watch the others!",
          "A very long street lined up with stalls selling all the local produces, fish sea food, meats, cheeses and fruits. Colourful and fun, go before 2pm, although many stalls are opened after 2.",
          "To stroll through this market gives one a wonderful, authentic and local feeling, which is one of the things i allways strive to find, when i travel. Here you defintely get it all. It's loud, caotic, colourful and just an experience not to miss.",
          "The Ballaro market was a few blocks inland from our B&B. Personally, I like visiting markets in foreign countries to see people going about their lives--I regard it as a way to balance the impression generated by the formal tourist attractions. The Ballaro market did not",
          "We visited market while in Palermo. Our tour group was taking overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples and we purchased items (bread, cheese, salamis, vegetables and of course wine) to have a meal for the trip. A very nice example of Italian markets that weave through streets",
          "In my (humble) opinion the best market to visit as a tourist in Palermo although our hostess shops at and swears by Capo",
          "This is a huge market stretching through mant streets. We loved looking at the many differernt and,to us,strange foods on sale. The whole atmosphere is fascinating and worth a couple of hours. It is also close to other sights like churches,etc.",
          "A cross between a medina and a street market, if you like to look and smell and feel, this is the place to go. Piles of carefully arranged vegetables, fish stalls, lighting shops, curtains and shoes and clothes and street food and utter tumbling chaos. A feast for the eyes.",
          "This market is overflowing with fruit, veg, fish & meat. Everything is as fresh as could be, and very inticing. the selection of fish is fascinating. A cook's delight.",
          "the small streets and little squares in the Ballaro district are the setting for a abundance of impressions: fresh fish, meat, and many many sorts of vegetables. Sellers are shouting out to praise their goods and to attract your attention. Although frequented by tourists, also",
          "Through a labyrinth of streets and back alleys you are suddenly thrown into the middle of a world that could be in the 21st century or back a hundred years! The streets are full of vendors selling fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, cheeses, bread and pastries - customers arguing",
          "We stopped here for some snacks for our room - green olives, salami, semolina bread, fresh fruit. However, the best thing in the market is the place that serves panelles (fried chickpea patties in a semolina bread) and crocces (fried potato with lime).",
          "This street market is fabulous and one can find great trinkets and treats. I love markets so this is always a pleasure to explore the cities oldest expressions of the merchant trade",
          "Great street market, selling mainly fish, fruit and veg. An amazing atmosphere, full of local life. A \"must see\". An amzing array of different fruit and veg - things we don't see in the UK.",
          "My husband says that this is not very fair of me, and that all outdoor markets will have dead things out on display and people uninterested in whether you think they are rude. Yes, but usually there is something else there which redeems the experience for me. A nice place to",
          "Like a giant flea market. Kind of fun. Best during the week. We liked the arab market. Both have interesting food and flavor.",
          "An amazing array of fruit and veg - violet aubergines the size of your head; tomatoes of every variety; prickly pears by the barrow-load; beautiful, flat peaches; and the first time we had seen whole swordfish on sale. What we expect of continental markets and rarely encounter.",
          "Ballaro is a nice market in Palermo, typical street market, selling all kind of food, vegetables, meat, fresh fish (morning only!) and any kind of \"made in china\"-items you can imagine. as in any market, beware of your belongings :) DO try: the dried fish, the fresh ricotta,",
          "I've was there everyday until I leaved there!I love to see some fruits and the shop!I've bought a lot of fruits and tried so many Italian food.Everything was so nice,But just I don't like the meat shop!!",
          "they say its like a middle eastern market - but it just felt like a normal italian market with the vendors yelling out what they have on special. If you have been to istanbul this will be a let down",
          "There are three great outdoor markets in Palermo and I think this one is the best! It's located on a labyrinth of streets between Corso Tukory and Corso Vittorio Emanuele and is a visual, aromatic and gustatory feast. Vendors singing or shouting out their offerings, huge tuna",
          "If you want a small, dying glimpse of old Palermo, this is it. Open air, with scooters buzzing around you, great values on everything from eggplants to goats' heads. Do try and get there early, as the fresh fish and mat is usually gone before it gets too warm.",
          "I was born in Palermo and trust me, this is Palermo, there you can find the kind of food that you can imagine, cocked and not, with the seller that shout to attract you. It's very populous so pay attention , is not dangerous but pay attention to your wallet or to your camera",
          "This is the most authentic open market in Palermo and the closest I have ever seen in Europe to an african zoco. Food sold there is so fresh and tasty and much cheaper than any shop or supermarket. It's so funny to see how much do they scream to sell their stuff. an awesome",
          "i thought some of the reviews were over hyped but just my opinion. it is a lovely market to go buy fresh food, but i would not rate it anymore highly than a place to buy groceries....if you want fresh fish/meat, make sure you go in the morning before 10am, rather than later in",

        "wiki": "The Palazzo Alliata di Villafranca is a noble family's palace in the Palazzo Reale district of Palermo. It occupies the whole city block between the Cassaro and the back of Via dell'Universit\u00e0 and the whole of a side of Piazza Bologni.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt originated in the 16th century as the home of the powerful Beccadelli di Bologna family, originally from Bologna but settling in Sicily during the Renaissance. One member of this family was Il Panormita, a famous poet of the late Aragonese court on the island. The family also gave its name to the piazza in front of the palace, previously known as the \"Piano d'Aragona\". \nBetween 1600 and 1650 the palace was acquired by the Alliata di Villafranca and it remained their main residence in Palermo until the late 20th century. In the following century the palace was rebuilt to its current late 17th century appearance to designs by the architect Giovanni Battista Vaccarini.The monumental facade with two symmetrical doors recalls the era during which the building was used by the Kingdom of Sicily's postal service, as do a number of rooms on the ground floor. The two large stucco coats of arms by Giacomo Serpotta show the heraldic arms of the Alliata as Princes of Villafranca. A plaque on the centre of the main facade recalls Giuseppe Garibaldi's stop in the building in 1860:\n\nIn questa illustre casail 27 maggio 1860\nper sole due ore\npos\u00f2 le stanche membra\nGIUSEPPE GARIBALDI\n---\nSingolare prodezza\nfra l'immane scoppio\ndelle micidiali armi di guerra\nsereno dormiva\nil genio sterminatore\ndi ogni tirannide\nThe palace houses one of the city's main art collections, including The Stoning of St Stephen and The Tribute Money (both painted in 1639 by Matthias Stom), a major Crucifixion by Anthony van Dyck, the 1791 Birth of Prince Giuseppe Alliata Moncada, son of Prince Fabrizio Alliata Colonna and Giuseppina Moncada Branciforte, with Abundance and Fame and with the Genius of Palermo Paying Homage by Desiderio De Angelis, Saint Joseph with the Christ Child (attributed to Pietro Novelli) and works by Francesco Lojacono, Mario Rutelli and Filippo de Pisis. The documents commissioning the Van Dyck are still in the family archive. As well as paintings on canvas and card, the building's art collections include drawings, prints and stucco medallions. The building's furnishings include mirrors, Murano glass chandeliers, elaborate over-doors, maiolica flooring (including the family coat of arms), furniture, vases, works in silver, bronze, porcelain and ceramic, classical archaeological finds, wax sculptures, geological samples, marble helmets and shields, lace and embroidery.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn 1984 the building's owner princess Rosalia Correale Santacroce handed it over to the archdiocese of Palermo as its seminary. It was occasionally open to the public for short periods until 2006 during the restoration of the Sala Verde and Sala dello Stemma (2006). It next hosted exhibitions and conferences including the restoration and display of the Stom works (October 2010-May 2011) and an exhibition centred on the newly-restored Van Dyck (December 2012-January 2013). The Musicians (attributed to Gaspare Traversi) and Annunciation (Pietro Novelli) have also been recently restored. The palace was reopened to the public from 2013 onwards by the archepiscopal seminary.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\n\n=== Ground floor ===\nKitchens\nScuderie.\nRooms of the royal postal service, the 'Corrieri maggiori ereditari del Regno di Sicilia'.\n\n\n=== Main floor ===\nScalone d'onore or main staircase.\nVestibolo or vestibule, with a 1929 mosaic window by Pietro Bevilacqua showing Saint Dacius Alliata and San Leo Alliata (respectively Archbishop of Milan from 530 and a martyr in 1274), both from the Alliata family.\nSalotto Verde or Salottino Barocco, recorded as housing the Van Dyck in 1625 and thus probably the building's original private chapel, with the only surviving fresco by Gaspare Serenari, showing St Dacius Presented to the Virgin Mary, surrounded by Serpotti-style stuccowork.\nSalottino Giallo or Sala del T\u00e9.\nSalone Rosa or Sala del baccar\u00e0.\nSalone del Principe Fabrizio Alliata Colonna., with a Serpotti-style stucco ceiling of allegorical subjects and previously housing Serenari's 1756 fresco Princess Admiring the Temple of Glory, the room now houses the two works by Stom, previously in the original Quadreria or Sala dei Musici.\nFumoir or Stanza di Cuoio.\nSala dello Stemma., previously housing Serenari's 1756 fresco Fame Showing the Princes' Glory, with the four seasons in stucco (workshop of Serpotta) at the corners of the room. The paintings were damaged by earthquakes and finally destroyed in bombing during the Second World War. It now houses two 1613-1618 works attributed to Pietro D'Asaro, Orpheus Singing to the Animals and Shipwreck or the Miraculous Haul of Fish\nSala dei Musici., previously a 'quadreria' or art gallery\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Palazzo Alliata di Villafranca (Palermo) at Wikimedia Commons\nUn viaggio all'interno dei fastosi saloni dello storico Palazzo Alliata di Villafranca, a Piazza Bologni (in Italian).

The building, after the automation of the lighthouse, went into ruin and the Municipality of Palermo plans to turn the lighthouse into a Museum even because it makes part of the Nature Reserve of Capo Gallo.The tower and the lantern are painted white; the lantern dome grey metallic. The lantern is positioned at 40 metres (130 ft) above sea level and emits two long white flashes in a 15 seconds period visible up to a distance of 16 nautical miles (30 km; 18 mi). The lighthouse is completely automated and managed by the Marina Militare with the identification code number 3198 E.F.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of lighthouses in Italy\nMondello\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nServizio Fari Marina Militare",

          "Great views, transparent water and possibility to find a really lonely place even on weekend. Just continue walking or riding further, do not stop at first crowded spots. Grab some street food and cold drinks there from vans and continue walking. You wont find sand beaches so be",
          "We took a small boat trip from the old Harbour beyond the Torre H\u00f4tel - to go to Isla delle Femine, Women's Island and Grotto d'Olio. Both snorkeling and diving options with qualified, knowledgeable staff- good coffee and croissants for break - and fabulous views. They can also",
          "Not obvious to find but it's worthy. The reserve is on the north end of Mondello, the street leads to the Torre hotel and beyond that, there is a road that leads to a yatch club at the foot of impressive rocky cliffs. That's the start of the reserve. The concrete path goes all",
          "Clear transparent water, waves, rocks, cliffs, rustle of the grass, lighthouse near the @end of land@ - it is all there",
          "The road to the lighthouse (Faro) is only 2 km long but it gives you a chance to see the wildlife of the island. Feel the heat of the day, listen to the goats voices and their bells ringing and enjoy the changable beauty of the mountain -on one side and the sea - on the other",
          "This place is very beautiful Little getaway from Mondello city. Mondello itself did not impress us (dirty) but this area was very nice! Worth the walk to the end!",
          "Enjoy the blue and green hues of the sea, the amazing view, the steep mountain on the back, the triumph of nature and sun",
          "The Nature Reserve is a short walk from the main piazza in Mondello. It is quiet, has a beautiful view, but is quite windy. There are several private areas that rent out chairs by the day. We just walked down the rocks to the water and enjoyed the moment.",
          "Very beautiful and relaxing day! Walking a lot...easy walk. Wish I had the swimming suit with me...did not expect such a good weather.",
          "We couldn't visit as the nature reserve as it was closed due to fire risk. Very disappointing but understandable. Before travelling check that it will be open, especially in hot weather, in spring or autumn.",
          "Really nice beach, as we don't like sandy beaches. Good views for snorkelling. We really enjoyed this beach also because it was way more quiet than sandy beaches.",
          "A magical place where many people go to get married. The beautiful sea that surrounds the area coupled with ragged cliffs and warm breeze makes it a lovely location for a picnic or a place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Palermo.",
          "The Riserva starts just west of Mondello. Follow the winding main roads and you'll find it easily. There are beautiful places to snorkel and swim all long the shore, both before and especially after the small marina. There is not a lot of flat space for towels, but the water",
          "We have not even known that there were a natural reserve in that place, we have just walked through the beach in Mondello and arrived there. There were any indication about a natural reserve. The views vere nice, but the nudist beach is really bad placed : everobody pass by",
          "This place is amazing. Crystal clear water, quiet and is just a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery. A must go if you're in Mondello/Palermo. Only negative is that it's really hard to get back from if catching public transport because of the damn bus loop.",
          "We explored Capo Gallo on foot, walking from Mondello near the shore of the sea. We came there close to the sunset time, so the local people (who took a few eurocents from us for entrance) gave us a piece of advise to go to the old lighthouse at the very end of the cape. We went",
          "Well 20 minutes walk and you are in paradise... Maybe bit to crowdy (I walked only to the first beach) and not sandy (full of rocks) but definitely worth to go there and have a few relaxing hours. I will go there again!",
          "We walked to the first beach which was areally great place for a swim. Just sorry that we did not more time to walk further. Highly recommended",
          "Approach from the east side, and the first beach is a 20 minute walk which gets very crowded. Worth going on to the next beach, so pack lots of water, food and wear good walking shoes or boots. Take snorkeling stuff as there are accessible coves and rocky areas to explore. If",
          "Beautiful spot, crystal clear water, much quieter than Mondello. However, it must be said it isn't a place to put a towel down and relax as there are mainly rocks and flat sandy areas are few and far between. Despite it's beauty and short walk (20 minutes) from Mondello, it's",
          "The only word that i can say is beautifull, is not just the view or the scenary also the confort of be in a quite place, the colors of the sea are amaizing and the weather was just fantastic!",
          "A local friend introduced me to this incredible bathing spot not far from the crowded Mondello Beach. Despite being a weekend, there were only a handful of people when I went to this clothing-optional place which made it perfect. You need to be reasonably fit to walk along"

        "wiki": "The Villa Giulia, also known as Villa del Popolo, and as Villa Flor is a park in Palermo, lying to the east of the botanical gardens. The park was commissioned by magistrate D. Antonino La Grua e Talamanca, marquis of Regalmici, in 1777 with inspiration from Giovanni Meli. Construction began that year and was completed in 1778. It was extended and enlarged in 1866. Designed by Nicol\u00f2 Palma and named after Giulia Guevara (wife of Viceroy Marcantonio Colonna, prince of Stigliano, to whom the villa was dedicated), it was Palermo's first public park.\n\n\n== The garden ==\nThe original entrance overlooking the Foro Italico is of a monumental neoclassical design. It has been permanently closed, however, so access to the garden is now obtained through the primary entrance on Lincoln Street. That gate area is less developed.\nThe heart of the villa is the dodecahedron fountain, featuring a sculpture of a dodecahedral marble clock created by the mathematician Lorenzo Federici, each face of the dodecahedron featuring a sundial. This is supported by a statue of Atlas by Ignazio Marabitti, set in the centre of a circular fountain. Decorations surrounding the fountain consist of various metal sculptures.\nAround the central fountain are four exedra, designed by Giuseppe Damiani Almeyda and intended to be used for musical performances. The entire central square was originally used for musical and theatrical entertainment.\n\nThe four corners contained round seating areas, though only two of these still exist. The avenues of the garden are lined with various busts depicting notable people in the city's history.Among the marble sculptures, the most significant is the \"Fontana del Genio a Villa Giulia\" - the Genius of Palermo which has become an emblem of the city, built in 1778 by Ignazio Marabitti.\n\n\n== Restoration ==\nFrom Spring 2003 until Autumn 2005 areas of the Garden were restored with pan-European funding.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It is a must see and not very far to walk from the archaeology museum or Teatro Massimo. Strangely enough it was 1 of only a couple of places that we visited that had a souvenir shop within its confines. You are given audio guides as part of the entrance fee and when we went in",

          "This is one of the best place to visit if you are in Palermo. It is really AMAZING!! Unfortunately, it is not always open and noone will explain you anything about it. It is sad to see that people in Palermo do not care at all about their treasures..",
          "Who would have thought that stucco could look so great. What an absolute gem this is. Well worth visiting.",
          "I had seen this on a documentary last year and vowed to see it when I visited Palermo. Reasonably close to my hotel I walked to it in the rain. The whole visual experience, plus free audio guide was an unforgettable experience. Having seen stuccos the previous day in Castelbuono",
          "Admission 4 Euros, well worth the price. The interior was beautiful, the inlaid mother of pearl benches were work of arts on its own. We went on a Monday morning and was not crowded at all.",
          "For some reason we had a hard time finding this church which looks like nothing from the outside but in the end it was worth the time and effort. It is absolutely unique and each panel tells a story. We were there on our own but it would have been nice to have a guide to explain",
          "Breathtaking \u2013 I never thought I would say that about Baroque stucco sculpture, but to see the Oratorio at St. Cita in Palermo is truly, well, breathtaking. All is white, save for a few bronze elements: a lute, a sword, a lamb, a leave\u2026 Putti everywhere, babies with wings",
          "Absolutely mind-blowing when you walk into the oratory. Could have sat for hours just looking at the figures and stories recounting the battle of Lepanto. Serpotta's skill as a sculptor was phenomenal. His cherubs are gorgeous, chubby life-like babies with different",

          "I have never seen anything like this before. Baroque sculptures all over the capella made in fantastic stucco. Engels, lovely fat 'babies', stories from the Bible etc. And it is all held in complete white. Really a 'must see'.",
          "You enter through a dull looking door and are soon amazed at the interior. Palermo is packed with fantastic churches and this is one of the most stunning.",
          "The exterior & most of the church's interior are not worth the stop, but the main altar and one small chapel should make it worth your wild. The main altar has a large white marble relief sculpture which is really nice but the main reason to stop is the ornate marbled inlaid",
          "Amazing stucco work. It's like being inside a huge meringue cake. The craftsmanship is unbelievable.",
          "I saw this wonderful oratory with its fabulous stucco work in a BBC documentary programme about Sicily and, because I was so impressed, I was determined to see it. The Via Valverde is a narrow street of rundown buildings off the Via Roma and it is very easy to miss the entrance",
          "This oratory is a must for those visitors who want to see beautiful maserworks of Serpotta and understand the Baroque glories of Palermo during the Spanish centuries.",
          "We had to check out this marvelous place after watching a documentary video on the area. The entire room comes alive in a 3D style setting, with majestuous and magnificent stories told within a white marble (I think) design.",
          "This oratorio has complete displays of stucco statues and a helpful guide. It is a better display than the Lorenzo oratorio where many figures have been removed, probably for restoration.",
          "I've have visited many chaples, cathedrales and churches in Italy, but this is one of the most uniques chaple I have ever seen. I recommend taking the time to find this amazing place and enjoy the decorations as they come to life before your eyes. I think in addition to this",
          "A lovely quiet peaceful church, seen on Sicily Unpacked and well worth visiting. You have to pay entry. About 4 Euros.",
          "This chapel,slightly off the main tourist track,is well worth the diversion.Here you can view the stunning marble stucco decorations of sculptor Serpotta,in a Baroque church. An added bonus was a small I pad given to visitors with a very interesting commentary, which really",
          "Have never seen plaster work like this. That said, it's worth 20-30 minutes of your time as you browse the city.",
          "A breathtaking display of Serpotta stucco art and craft! Unless (and even if) you\u2019ve already seen some of Serpotta\u2019s other works, the delicacy, detail, scale and beauty of his stucco art displayed all around this oratorio will impress and awe.",
          "OK, I almost didn't go here. Who cares about kitsch plaster cherubs, right? Boy, was I wrong! These sweet little puttis are as lifelike and as full of life as real children. They make physical comments on the biblical scenes from holding a flame to someone's foot to",
          "Build between 17th and 18th centuries by sculptor Giacomo Serpotta. It is filled with putti cupids, angels. Beautiful!",
          "Unique and beautiful art and sculpture at wants more words but I think my summary is sufficient. Don't miss",
          "After visiting San Lorenzo, this should be on everyone's itinerary. The Battle of Lepanto in stucco work is an amazing tour de force but there are many other wonderful studies. But is it too much to ask for a painting over the Altar which would really do justice to this interior?",
          "This Oratorio is small, and with everything practically all in white, it is surprisingly attractive. The detail in the stucco is incredible and in excellent shape. It takes a while to take in the workmanship. The altar stands out because of the colour there . A good comparison",
          "Probably the best example of Baroque architecture in Palermo. Definitely worth a visit. From there you can take a nice walk to the near open-air market of Vucciria.",
          "I'm not a particular fan of Stucco and church architecture but found this place very nice indeed. Only a short visit but a good one",
          "The Oratorio was erected in gratitude for the Virgin's intervention in the Battle of Lepanto (1571) against the Turks. The interior (1720) by Giacomo Serpotto is lined with figures and reliefs all in stucco. The effect is extravagant and delightful, and different from anything",
          "This should be on everyone's 'must do' list of Palermo attractions. The detail and realism in the sculpture which covers every wall is stunning. Unlike the nearby San Domenico oratory, where sculpture and painting share your attention, the focus here is purely on sculpture and",
          "This oratory is definitely a main sight in Palermo. It is located on Via Valverde but can also be entered via the church of San Mamiliano on Via Squarcialupa (across the cloister to the left hand side of the church - the benefit of entering through the church is to see another",
          "This oratorio is another of Serpotta's magnificent stucco and marble interiors. It is simply well worth visiting.",

          "We loved this beautiful baroque chapel It was empty apart from ourselves which was also nice Take time to look at the details",
          "An amazing oratory; for anyone who likes baroque excess then this is a must see. There is a very good audio guide, available in many languages, which is free. Cost of admission is 4 Euros or 6 Euros for this plus another nearby oratory.",
          "Down the street from the port in Palermo, you will find ( signs are everywhere ) this little known church. It is worth the time to visit it",
          "This is possibly a unique Stucco work, by one man, the sculptor Giacomo Serpotta. An extraordinary concept where the artist has incorporated all the mysteries of The Rosary, surrounded by many Putti some times ironically illustrating or commenting on those mysteries. Together",
          "This was worth seeing in Palermo for the amazing marble, sculptures and art. We had a guide who was very knowledgeable and the history behind this oratory was great to hear.",
          "Amazing work of art in exceptional condition. Audio guide provided gives an deep understanding of the work.",
          "This Oratory is well worth seeking out, the stucco work is of the highest order, marble flooring and inlaid wooden seating around the room is first class, audio tour gives good concise information to what's here, a small admission is payable but worth every cent to view these",
          "This was the 2nd recommendation of sites worth seeing in Palermo as shown on the UK TV programme and wow! - what a treat to see such a display of stucco work - really worthwhile and astonishing skills displayed for just \u20ac6. The ticket did provide as well the option to visit",
          "This oratorio was one of the surprise high points of my visit to Palermo. The sculptures were completed by a master and the chapel is exquisite. There is a wonderful audio guide too. When we were there, they were setting up for a wedding, which must have been gorgeous.",
          "This oratorio contains sculptures that will take your breath away in their detail. There is an audio tour that gives you a great amount of detail on the artist and history of the work.",
          "The stucco sculptures that look like marble by Serpoletto are beautiful. You can find even more in Agrigento, chiesa di santo spirito.. there is an audio guide, which is useful for finding your way around",
          "Beautyful, exquisite stucco decorations welcome you and make you feel lighter, like in a precious cloud. IMHO Giacomo Serpotta reached here the highest level of his artistic production. You should really not miss it, and please take some time to observe puttoes having fun an",
          "An amazing church, from the outside it does not look as nice as some other churches in Palermo, but once inside you will be pleasantly surprised.",
          "It was a beautiful room. Worth seeing. You can sit and relax for a bit while looking at lovely art work.",
          "A must visit, the adornments are wonderful, a unexpected treat,read about it and glad we visited,On the touist trail so we had to tag along at the back,no one minded,after all we paid our entry.Do use the free recrded guide to help you understand the beauty of the place.",
          "Palermo's treasures are hidden away in scruffy-looking streets and alleys. Don't let that bother you. It could take you a while to locate this oratorio but it's worth the trouble. It's probably Serpotta's masterpiece. It's just stunning. I've been there twice over the years,",
          "Where do I begin - try to visit Oratorio del Rosario in S. Cita... E6 covers visiting Oratorio del SS. Rosario in S. Domenico as well. Both really worth seeking out - behind Rinascente, Via Roma...",
          "The stucco is stunning, playful, witty and outre. The last time I say so many buttocks (plaster) was on the ponds in Hampstead Heath but that did not have the view on offer here. The pupi - little cheubs- were a hoot and the overall effect was like a spiritual sugar rush,",
          "Near the port, on a quiet street, It is a retreat from the city. It is a must visit to see this. The courtyard is beautiful with a really unique tree.",
          "So happy I found this. Exquisite stucco work.I am grateful to Giorgio and Andrew for showing this on their TV programme. Such a lovely experience and in contras to the Palentine Chapel and the Marmortana church.",
          "The church contains the first extensive stucco work by Giacomo Serpotta, it is truly fantastic . More of his work can be seen in the nearby Oratorio of Santa Domenica.",
          "Lesser known than some of Palermo's most famous attractions like la Cappela Palatina, La Martorana church and the duomo in nearby Monreale, the Oratorio di Santa Cita will leave you speechless and moved. This is another masterpiece of Sicilian Baroque from Sicilian artist",
          "It is truly amazing and spiritual in this grotto. I cried. many pilgrims have gotten healed from st Rosalie. A must see",
          "I think it's well worth a visit! I can't describe it with words. If someone loves architecture and taking photos, then that's the place to be!",
          "We don't think we had ever seen oratorios before this trip, although we have been to Sicily before and Italy many times. The stucco is sensational and we could look at the scenes for hours.",
          "We found this lovely place simply by chance. How glad we were to have found it. The place is spectacular and well worth the visit.",
          "I went to see this Oratorio with stuccos by Serpotta after visiting the Oratario of San Lorenzo so I was less impressed than I would have been if I had seen this one first. Neverthless it is really beautiful. It is much bigger than San Lorenzo so it the stuccos are a bit further",
          "This was one of the beautiful places of art we have ever seen. If you are in Palermo you must see this.",
          "I really don't like Baroque architecture or most of the art, but Serpotta's amazingly creative and human figures warm the heart. He isn't trying to be grand and impressive, his artwork was designed to speak to ordinary people and it does just that.",
          "The oratory was a little hard to find - but we kept trying. The 2nd day we came on a Sunday and it was closed (perhaps because it was low season - but not sure). On a Tuesday we went back again and were successful in getting in (sign said open until 2 PM today). The reliefs",
          "We stumbled across this gem while exploring the city . Beautiful inside, must use audio guide, very informative.",
          "These sculpture creations by the master craftsman are wondrous. Serpotta was a poor artist living in an area of Palermo where statues for religious processions were made. The works in this chapel, which is dedicated to the Rosary, were his first major commission. Serpotta had",
          "The little know but highly regarded 17th century sculptor Giacomo Serpota lavishly ornamented this small, but attractive space with a profusion of full relief sculpture done in stucco (not considered as prestigious as marble, hence Serpota's relative obscurity.) The oratory",
          "We had seen a tv show in which this chapel featured, so decided to visit. We found it very difficult to find. it is a little confusing as there are two \"Oratorio Rosario\" but finally found it and were we delighted to do so! It is hard to believe the statues, scenes, etc are",
          "This is a very delightfully different church than all the others I have seen in my travels to Italy. One just sort of stands there with the mouth hanging open! Go see it.",
          "We picked up a taxi at the port (set fee 120 euro for 5 hours) and proceeded to visit all the sites of Palermo on our wish list. The day was wonderful and provided us with an agglomeration of the tours that were available from the ship and an attentive guide who was hell bent",
          "We had seen this on the Sicily Unpacked TV programme and were determined to visit it - and we are so glad that we did. It was incredible. It was hard to find, being situated off a back street, but once inside it was magnificent and left a lasting impression on both of us.",
          "Get the headsets; their detail is superb. The room is amazing; you wonder how the sculptor could create such beauty! It took about a half hour to go all around the room, with the headsets telling all there was to learn about each woman, each cherub, and the meaning of each",

        "wiki": "Palazzo Abatellis (also known as Palazzo Patella) is a palace in Palermo, Sicily, southern Italy, located in the Kalsa quarter. It is home to the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia, the Gallery of Art for the Sicilian region.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe palazzo, an example of Gothic-Catalan architecture,  was designed in the 15th century by Matteo Carnelivari, at the time working in Palermo at the palazzo Aiutamicristo. It was the residence of Francesco Abatellis (or Patella), port master of the Kingdom of Sicily.\nAfter the death of Abatellis, it remained to his wife, and, after her death, it was given to a female monastery. Several modifications were carried on to adapt it to monastic life. They included a chapel, built on the left side of the chapel (1535\u20131541), hiding one of the fa\u00e7ades. In the 18th century, following the construction of a bigger church (the current Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0), the chapel was abolished and divided into several rooms. The front part was used as parlatory, while the rear section, with the altar removed, was turned into a series of storage rooms.\nDuring the night between 16 and 17 April 1943 the palace was struck during an Allied air bombing: the loggia, the portico, the south-western sector and the wall of the western tower crumbled down. The palace was then restored, and it was decided to use it for the Galleria d\u2019Arte per le collezioni d\u2019arte medievale (\"Gallery of medieval collection\"). Works were directed by the architects Mario Guiotto and, later, Armando Dillon. They were completed in 1953, and  Carlo Scarpa was commissioned the setup of the art gallery, which was opened on 23 June 1954.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe regional gallery is home to many works acquired when several religious orders were suppressed in 1866. They were previously housed in the Pinacoteca della Regia Universit\u00e0 and, from 1866, in the Museo Nazionale of Palermo, which became a regional museum when Sicily acquired autonomous status.\n\nThe ground floor contains 12th century wooden works, 14th and 15th century works including some by Antonello Gagini,  painted maiolica from the 14th-17th centuries, the 15th-century Bust of a Gentlewoman by Francesco Laurana  and painted panels of wooden ceilings. The large fresco of the Triumph of Death  (most likely dating to 1445), is exhibited in the former chapel.\nOn the first floor is the museum's most famous work, the Virgin Annunciate, by Antonello da Messina (15th century), considered among Italy's best Renaissance paintings. Also present are three panels with St. Augustine, St. Gregory the Great and St. Jerome also by Antonello, once part of a polyptych now destroyed, and Vouet's Saint Agatha's Vision of Saint Peter in Prison. The museum contains the Netherlandish Malvagna triptych by the Early Netherlandish painters Jan Gossaert and Gerard David, and a Deposition by Jan Provost. It also houses a depiction of Moses by Pietro Novelli.\n\n\n== References ==\nMeli F., Matteo Carnelivari e l\u2019architettura del quattro e cinquecento in Palermo, Fratelli Palomi Editori, Rome 1958\nMorello P., Palazzo Abatellis.

He commissioned the decoration of the Sala Magna (\"Grand Hall\"), with a painted wooden ceiling by Cecco di Naro, Simone da Corleone and Pellegrino Darena.  From the late 15th century to 1517 it housed the Aragonese-Spanish viceroys of Sicily; later it was home to the Royal Customs and, from 1600 to 1782, the tribunal of the Holy Inquisition.\nThe palace was restored in the 20th century, with numerous elements associated with its role as a jail of the Inquisition. During the works, the grooves left by iron cages in which had been hung the severed heads of the nobles who had rebelled against emperor Charles V were discovered in the fa\u00e7ade. The palace is now a museum; among the artworks, it houses Renato Guttuso's Vucciria.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGabrici, Ettore; Ezio Levi (2003). Lo Steri di Palermo e le sue pitture. Palermo: L'Epos.",

          "This is one of the most unique places in Palermo. It is actually the central building of the University, though in older times was the Tribunal of the Inquisition and a prison. You can see in the walls the remains ofthe drawings of the prisoners. It is amazing. Definitely worth",
          "We enjoyed our visit, we mainly came to see the painting ' La Vucciria' by Renato Guttuso and were a bit surprised to have to take a guided tour. We are so glad we did as the cell drawings from the Spanish Inquisition were fantastic, and it's good to have someone explain to you",

          "I went today to see the painting La Vucciria by Renato Guttuso. Sadly we had already booked our holiday to Sicily before discovering that the original had been sent to Milan for the duration of Expo 2015. It has been replaced by a replica photograph by Enzo Brai so I was happy",
          "I have been to other Inquisition museums, which tend to focus on the torture. This place is quite different. You come to see the graffiti the prisoners made during their imprisonment. Graffiti is something of an understatement. These are murals. Also there are poems and messages",

        "wiki": "The Chinese Palace (Italian: Palazzina Cinese), also known as Real Casina alla Cinese, is a former royal residence of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies designed in the style of Chinoiserie. It is located in Palermo, inside the park of La Favorita. The Ethnographic Museum of Sicily, named after Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8, is located in one of the Palace's guesthouse.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was designed in 1799 by the architect Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia on commission by the King Ferdinand III of Sicily. The ruler had previously bought land and a house that was Chinese in design, belonging to the Baron Benedetto Lombardo and designed by Marvuglia himself. The architectural complex and its garden were completed between 1800 and 1806.\nIn 1860, as a result of the Unification of Italy, the residence passed to the House of Savoy. Then, it became the property of the Comune of Palermo and has been converted into a museum.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe apartments of the Palace are distributed on three floors. On the first floor there are the reception hall, a dining room and the bedroom of the King. On the second floor there is the apartment of the Queen Maria Carolina of Austria. On the third floor there's an octagonal terrace covered like a pagoda.\nThe building is decorated with paintings and frescoes of Giuseppe Velazquez, Vincenzo Riolo and other artists.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nParco della Favorita\nRiserva naturale orientata Monte Pellegrino\nMuseo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Image gallery\n(in Italian) History of the palace - Provincia Regionale di Palermo",

        "wiki": "La Favorita Park (Italian: Parco della Favorita or Real Tenuta della Favorita) is a large city park in Palermo, Italy. Established in 1799 by Ferdinand III of Sicily, it has an overall area of 400 hectares (990 acres), and represent the biggest green area of Palermo. It is located at the foot of Monte Pellegrino, in the north-western part of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was founded by the King Ferdinand III after his escape from Naples in 1798. In order to create the park, many properties were forfeited by the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The park was used for several purposes: it represented a fresh oasis during the summer, but also a game preserve and a space for agricultural experiments with big cultivations of citrus fruits, olive trees, ashes, nuts and sumac.\nThe park is part of the Riserva naturale orientata Monte Pellegrino, established by the Sicilian Region in 1995.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe park extends from the shade of Monte Pellegrino to the neighbourhood of Pallavicino. Two long streets (named after Hercules and Diana) cross in parallel the park, connecting the centre of Palermo to the seaside borough of Mondello. The streets are interwoven thanks to a third avenue named after Pomona.\nWithin (or near) the park are located several places of interest like the royal residence called Palazzina Cinese (with the attached Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8), the precious Villa Niscemi, the Neoclassical Fountain of Hercules, the Renzo Barbera Stadium and other sport facilities.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\nThe city was founded in 734 BC by the Phoenicians as Ziz. Palermo then became a possession of Carthage. Two Greek colonies were established, known collectively as Panormos or \"All-Port\"; the Carthaginians used this name on their coins after the 5th century BC. As Panormus, the town became part of the Roman Republic and Empire for over a thousand years. From 831 to 1072 the city was under Arab rule during the Emirate of Sicily when the city first became a capital. The Arabs shifted the Greek name into Balarm (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0645\u200e), the root for Palermo's present-day name. Following the Norman reconquest, Palermo became the capital of a new kingdom (from 1130 to 1816), the Kingdom of Sicily and the primary residence and power base of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and King Conrad IV.\nThe population of Palermo urban area is estimated by Eurostat to be 855,285, while its metropolitan area is the fifth most populated in Italy with around 1.2 million people. In the central area, the city has a population of around 676,000 people. The inhabitants are known as Palermitani or, poetically, panormiti. The languages spoken by its inhabitants are the Italian language and the Palermitano dialect of the Sicilian language.\nPalermo is Sicily's cultural, economic and tourism capital. It is a city rich in history, culture, art, music and food. Numerous tourists are attracted to the city for its good Mediterranean weather, its renowned gastronomy and restaurants, its Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Art Nouveau churches, palaces and buildings, and its nightlife and music. Palermo is the main Sicilian industrial and commercial center: the main industrial sectors include tourism, services, commerce and agriculture. Palermo currently has an international airport, and a significant underground economy.\nIn fact, for cultural, artistic and economic reasons, Palermo was one of the largest cities in the Mediterranean and is now among the top tourist destinations in both Italy and Europe. It is the main seat of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale. The city is also going through careful redevelopment, preparing to become one of the major cities of the Euro-Mediterranean area.Roman Catholicism is highly important in Palermitan culture. The Patron Saint of Palermo is Santa Rosalia whose Feast Day is celebrated on 15 July. The area attracts significant numbers of tourists each year and is widely known for its colourful fruit, vegetable and fish markets at the heart of Palermo, known as Vucciria, Ballar\u00f2 and Capo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPalermo lies in a basin, formed by the Papireto, Kemonia and Oreto rivers. The basin was named the Conca d'Oro (the Golden Basin) by the Arabs in the 9th century. The city is surrounded by a mountain range which is named after the city itself. These mountains face the Tyrrhenian Sea. Palermo is home to a natural port and offers excellent views to the sea, especially from Monte Pellegrino.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nPalermo experiences a hot-summer subtropical Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa) with moderate seasonality. Summers are very long, hot and dry due to the domination of subtropical high pressure system, while winters are mild and changeable, with rainy weather due to the polar front. Temperatures in autumn and spring are typically warm. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual air temperature of 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F); it is one of the warmest cities in Italy. It receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year. Snow is a rare occurrence having snowed about a dozen times since 1945. Since the 1940s to nowadays there have been at least five times when considerable snowfall has occurred. In 1949 and in 1956, when the minimum temperature went down to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), the city was blanketed by some centimetres of snow. Snowfalls also occurred in 1981, 1986, 1999 and 2014. The average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 \u00b0C (66 \u00b0F); from 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) in February to 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) in August. In the period from November to May, the average sea temperature exceeds 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F) and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nPalermo is surrounded by mountains, which form a cirque around the city. Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about 1,333 metres (4,373 ft) high. However, historically, the most important mount is Monte Pellegrino, which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain. The mount lies right in front of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"Italian Journey\".\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\nToday both the Papireto river and the Kemonia are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of Mondello.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nShown above are the thirty five quarters of Palermo: these thirty five neighbourhoods or \"quartiere\" as they are known, are further divided into eight governmental community boards.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nPalermo has a large architectural heritage and is notable for its many Norman buildings.\n\n\n=== Palaces and museums ===\n\nPalazzo dei Normanni (the Norman Palace), a notable example of Norman architecture, this palace houses the Cappella Palatina.\nZisa (1160) and Cuba, magnificent castles/houses historically used by the kings of Palermo for hunting. The Zisa today houses the Islamic museum. The Cuba was once encircled by water.\nPalazzo Natoli\nPalazzo Chiaramonte\nPalazzo Abatellis. Built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical Catalan Gothic style, with Renaissance influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by Francesco Laurana (1471) and the Malvagna Triptych (c. 1510), by Jan Gossaert and the famous Annunziata by Antonello da Messina.\nThe Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas is one of the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from Etruscan, Carthaginian, Roman and Hellenistic civilisations. It houses all the decorative remains from the Sicilian temples of Segesta and Selinunte.\nPalazzina Cinese, royal residence of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and location of the Ethnografic Museum of Sicily.\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nPalermo Cathedral: Located at Corso Vittorio Emanuele, corner Via Matteo Bonello, its long history has led to an accumulation of different architectural styles, the latest being the 18th century.\nCappella Palatina, the 12th century chapel of the Palazzo dei Normanni, has outstanding mosaics in both Western and the Eastern traditions and a roof by Saracen craftsmen.\nSan Giovanni dei Lebbrosi\nSan Giovanni degli Eremiti (St. John of the Hermit Order): Located near the Palazzo dei Normanni, a 12th-century church notable for its bright red domes, a remnant of Arab influence in Sicily. In his Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily, F. Elliot described it as \"... totally oriental... it would fit well in Baghdad or Damascus\". The bell tower is an example of Norman architecture.\nChiesa della Martorana: Also known as Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio (St Mary of the Admiral), the church is annexed to the next-door church of San Cataldo and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original layout was a compact cross-in-square (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern apses adjoin directly to the naos, instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture. The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church. The interior decoration is elaborate, and includes Byzantine mosaics.\nSan Cataldo: Church, on the central Piazza Bellini, which is a good example of Norman architecture.\nSanta Maria della Gancia\nSanta Caterina: This church is located behind Piazza Pretoria and built between 1566 and 1596 in the baroque style.\nSanta Maria della Catena: This church was built between 1490\u20131520. Designed by Matteo Carnilivari: The name derives from chains that were once attached to one of the walls.\nSan Domenico: Located near Via Roma, it is known as the \u201cPantheon of illustrious Sicilians\u201d.\nSan Giuseppe dei Teatini: Located near the Quattro Canti, it is an example of Sicilian Baroque.\nOratorio di San Lorenzo Working in stucco, Rococo sculptor Giacomo Serpotta, his brother Giuseppe and his son Procopio, decorated the church (1690/98\u20131706) with such a profusion of statuary, and an abundance of putti, the walls appear alive. In October 1969, two thieves removed Caravaggio's Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence from its frame. It has never been recovered.\nOratorio del Rosario: Completed by Giacomo Serpotta in (1710\u201317)\nSanta Teresa alla Kalsa, which derives its name from Al-Khalisa, an Arabic term meaning elected, was constructed between 1686-1706 over the former Emir's residence, is one of the best examples of Sicilian Baroque. It has a single, airy nave, with stucco decorations from the early 18th century.\nSanta Maria dello Spasimo was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired Raphael to paint his famous Sicilia's Spasimo, now in the Museo del Prado. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.\nChurch of the Gesu (Church of Jesus): Located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of Basilian monks. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the frescos. The interior has a Latin cross plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in St Anne's Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.\nSan Francesco di Assisi: this church was built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an earthquake. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa\u00e7ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in Renaissance style, as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by Antonio, Giacomo Gagini and Francesco Laurana. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.\nChurch of the Magione: Officially known as the church of the Holy Trinity. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the Cistercian monks.\n\n\n=== Squares and public monuments ===\n\nQuattro Canti is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (mandamenti). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa\u00e7ades so the square has an almost octagonal form.\nPiazza Pretoria was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by Francesco Camilliani, the Fontana Pretoria.\nThe monument to Charles V on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631.\n\n\n=== City walls ===\n\nPalermo has at least two rings of city walls, many pieces of which still survive. The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city \u2013 the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east\u2013west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porto Nuovo.\nIn the medieval period the walled city was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east\u2013west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner there was a defence, Castello a Mare, to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at Santa Maria della Catena (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to Palazzo dei Normanni and back to Porta Nuova.Several gates in the city wall survive. Images of the wall can be seen here.\n\n\n=== Opera houses ===\n\nUp until the beginning of 20th century there were hundreds of small opera theatres known as magazzeni in the city of Palermo.\n\nThe Teatro Massimo (\"Greatest Theatre\") was opened in 1897. It is the biggest in Italy (8,000 m2, 86,000 sq ft), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Paris Opera and the Vienna State Opera), renowned for its perfect acoustics. Enrico Caruso sang in a performance of La Gioconda during the opening season, returning for Rigoletto at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.\nThe Teatro Politeama was built between 1867 and 1874.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe cathedral has a heliometer (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, la Meridiana, on the floor, running precisely north\u2013south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year.\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of time and the calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24\u2011hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to know when the vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter.\nThe Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo Botanical Garden), founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of 10 hectares (25 acres).\nOne site of interest is the Capuchin Catacombs, with many mummified corpses in varying degrees of preservation.\nClose to the city is the 600-metre-high (2,000 ft) Monte Pellegrino, offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.\nAnother good panoramic viewpoint is the promontory of Monte Gallo (586 m, 1,923 ft), near Mondello Beach.Moreton Bay fig of >30 m girth and of 32m height can be found on the Piazza Marina. This Ficus macrophylla is most probably the thickest tree in Europe.\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ===\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites include the Palazzo Reale with the Cappella Palatina, the Chiesa di San Giovanni degli Eremiti, the Chiesa di Santa Maria dell\u2019Ammiraglio, the Chiesa di San Cataldo, the Cattedrale di Palermo, the Palazzo della Zisa and the Ponte dell\u2019Ammiraglio. This makes Italy the country with the most UNESCO world heritage sites, and Sicily the region hosting the most within Italy.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 2010, there were 1.2 million people living in the greater Palermo area, 655,875 of which resided in the City boundaries, of whom 47.4% were male and 52.6% were female. People under age 15 totalled 15.6% compared to pensioners who composed 17.2% of the population. This compares with the Italian average of 14.1% people under 15 years and 20.2% pensioners. The average age of a Palermo resident is 40.4 compared to the Italian average of 42.8. In the ten years between 2001 and 2010, the population of Palermo declined by 4.5%, while the population of Italy, as a whole, grew by 6.0%. The reason for Palermo's decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and to Northern Italy. The current birth rate of Palermo is 10.2 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.3 births.\nAs of 2006, 97.79% of the population was of Italian descent. The largest immigrant group came from South Asia (mostly from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka): 0.80%, other European countries (mostly from Albania, Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia and Ukraine): 0.3%, and North Africa (mostly from Tunisia): 0.28%.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nEvidence of human settlement in the area now known as Palermo goes back to at least the Mesolithic period, perhaps around 8000 BC, where a group of cave drawings at nearby Addaura from that period have been found.  The original inhabitants were Sicani people who, according to Thucydides, arrived from the Iberian Peninsula (perhaps Catalonia).\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nIn 734 BC the Phoenicians, maritime traders from northern Canaan, built a small settlement on the natural harbor of Palermo, which became known as Ziz (Punic: \ud802\udd11\u202c\ud802\udd09\ud802\udd11, \u1e62Y\u1e62). It became one of the three main Phoenician colonies of Sicily, along with Motya and Soluntum. However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.\nThe first settlement is known as Paleapolis (Greek: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"Old City\", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called Neapolis (\u039d\u03b5\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2) or \"New City\". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab al-qa\u1e63r (castle, stronghold, see also alc\u00e1zar). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street (decumanus), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.\nCarthage was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement P\u00e1normos (\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"all port\" due to its large anchorage, from which the present name of the city developed. The Phoenicians began using the Greek name on the city's coinage from the 5th century BC. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 BC the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275 BC. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, Palermo fell under the control of several Germanic tribes. The first were the Vandals in 440 AD under the rule of their king Geiseric. The Vandals had occupied all the Roman provinces in North Africa by 455 establishing themselves as a significant force. They acquired Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily shortly afterwards. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic conquest under Theodoric the Great began in 488; Theodoric supported Roman culture and government unlike the Germanic Goths. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. Sicily was the first part of Italy to be taken under control of General Belisarius who was commissioned by Eastern Emperor. Justinian I solidified his rule in the following years.\n\nThe Arabs took control of the island in 904, and the Emirate of Sicily was established. Muslim rule on the island lasted for about 120 years. Palermo (Bal'harm during Arab rule) displaced Syracuse as the capital of Sicily. It was said to have then begun to compete with C\u00f3rdoba and Cairo in terms of importance and splendor. For more than a hundred years Palermo was the capital of a flourishing emirate.  The Arabs also introduced many agricultural crops which remain a mainstay of Sicilian cuisine.\n\nAfter dynastic quarrels however, there was a Christian reconquest in 1072. Normans conquered Palermo after a long siege. Indeed, the feat proved difficult because the Normans had never besieged such a populous city with such powerful walls. After 5 months siege, Normans built numerous stairs and war machines and finnally conquered the city. The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles, including Robert Guiscard and his army, who is regarded as a hero by the natives.  It was under his nephew Roger II of Sicily that Norman holdings in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula were promoted from the County of Sicily into the Kingdom of Sicily. The kingdom's capital was Palermo, with the King's Court held at the Palazzo dei Normanni. Much construction was undertaken during this period, such as the building of Palermo Cathedral. The Kingdom of Sicily became one of the wealthiest states in Europe.Sicily fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1194. Palermo was the preferred city of the Emperor Frederick II. Muslims of Palermo emigrated or were expelled during Holy Roman rule. After an interval of Angevin rule (1266\u20131282), Sicily came under control of the Aragon and Barcelona dynasties. By 1330, Palermo's population had declined to 51,000.\n\n\n=== Early modern era ===\n\nFrom 1479 until 1713 Palermo was ruled by the Kingdom of Spain, and again between 1717 and 1718. Palermo was also under Savoy control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718\u20131720 as a result of the Treaty of Utrecht. It was ruled by Austria between 1720 and 1734.\n\n\n=== Two Sicilies ===\nAfter the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Sicily was handed over to the House of Savoy, but by 1734 it was in Bourbon possession. Charles III chose Palermo for his coronation as King of Sicily. Charles had new houses built for the growing population, while trade and industry grew as well. However, Palermo had become just another provincial city as the Royal Court resided in Naples. Charles' son Ferdinand, though disliked by the population, took refuge in Palermo after the French Revolution in 1798. His son Alberto died on the way to Palermo and is buried in the city.\nWhen the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was founded, the original capital city was Palermo (1816) but a year later moved to Naples.\n\nFrom 1820 to 1848 Sicily was shaken by upheavals, which culminated on 12 January 1848, with a popular insurrection, the first one in Europe that year, led by Giuseppe La Masa. A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was Ruggero Settimo. The Bourbons reconquered Palermo in 1849, and remained under their rule until the time of Giuseppe Garibaldi. The general entered Palermo with his troops (the \u201cThousands\u201d) on 27 May 1860. After the plebiscite later that year Palermo, along with the rest of Sicily, became part of the new Kingdom of Italy (1861).\n\n\n=== Italian unification and today ===\n\nThe majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoy kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libert\u00e0. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, Ernesto's father, and built by the Rutelli & Mach\u00ec building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.\nDuring the Second World War, Palermo was heavily bombed by the Allied air forces in 1942 and 1943, until its capture during the Allied invasion of Sicily on 22 July 1943. The harbour (main objective of the air attacks) and the surrounding quarters were effectively destroyed, as was a considerable part of the city, with heavy civilian casualties.  When American troops entered Palermo in 1943 they were greeted with \"a thunderous welcome by what seemed the entire population demonstrating their feelings about Facsist rule.\"   The two captured Italian generals claimed that they were happy because in their view \"the Sicilians were not human beings but animals\". Anti-sicilian prejudice was part of the fascist regime's world view, being promoted by pro-fascist newspapers, particularly in the north of Italy.In 1946 the city was declared the seat of the Regional Parliament, as capital of a Special Status Region (1947) whose seat is in the Palazzo dei Normanni.\nA theme in the city's modern age has been the struggle against the Mafia, Red Brigades and outlaws such as Salvatore Giuliano, who controlled the neighbouring area of Montelepre. The Italian state effectively has had to share control of the territory, economically and administratively, with the Mafia.\nThe so-called \"Sack of Palermo\" was one of the dramatic consequences of this problem. The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that resulted in the destruction of a great number of historical buildings and green areas, filling the city with poor buildings, mainly between the 1950s and the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.\nThe Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo. A CNN article in July 2019 indicated that Sicilian Mafia activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the town of Passo Rigano. \"According to Italian police, the mafia not only engages in extortion there, but also has a large role in the town's legal economy -- with its involvement in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling.\" The police investigation at the time also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area mafia and American organized crime,  particularly the Gambino crime family. According to La Repubblica, \"Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned\".\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n\n==== Patron saints ====\n\nThe patron saint of Palermo is Saint Rosalia, who is widely revered.\nOn 14 July, people in Palermo celebrate the annual Festino, the most important religious event of the year. The Festino is a procession which goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the Black Death in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a sanctuary marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.\nBefore 1624 Palermo had four patron saints, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were Saint Agatha, Saint Christina, Saint Nympha and Saint Olivia.\nSaint Lucy is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called cucc\u00eca. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.\nSaint Benedict the Moor is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.\nThe ancient patron of the city was the Genius of Palermo, genius loci and numen protector of the place, that became the laic patron of the modern Palermo.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nPalermo hosts a professional football team, Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica Palermo, commonly referred to as simply Palermo, who currently compete in Serie D, having been excluded from Serie B after the 2018\u20132019 season.\nAfter the bankruptcy occurred in the summer of 2019, a new club was formed by the company Hera Hora Srl.\nThe Targa Florio was an open road endurance car race held near Palermo. Founded in 1906, it used to be one of the oldest sports car racing events until it was discontinued in 1977 due to safety concerns but has since run as a rallying event. Palermo was home to the grand depart of the 2008 Giro d'Italia. The initial stage was a 28.5-kilometre-long (17.7 mi) TTT (Team Time Trial).\nThe Internazionali Femminili di Palermo is an annual ladies professional tennis event held in the city, which is part of the WTA Tour.\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\nBeing Sicily's administrative capital, Palermo is a centre for much of the region's finance, tourism and commerce. The city currently hosts an international airport, and Palermo's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses. The economy mainly relies on tourism and services, but also has commerce, shipbuilding and agriculture. The city, however, still has high unemployment levels, high corruption and a significant black market empire (Palermo being the home of the Sicilian Mafia).\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nPalermo has a local railway called the Palermo metropolitan railway service.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nPalermo's public bus system is operated by AMAT which covers a net area of 340 km (211 mi). About 90 different routes reach every part of the city.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nPalermo has a public tram system finalized in 2015 and operated by AMAT. There are 4 lines:\n\nRoccella \u2014 Central Station\nBorgo Nuovo \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCEP \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\nCorso Calatafimi \u2014 Notarbartolo Station\n\n\n=== Coaches ===\nThe local coach company, AST, with its coaches totalling 35 lines, links Palermo to all of the main cities in Sicily.\n\n\n=== Palermo Public Transportation Statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Palermo, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 63 min. 14.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 23 min, while 48% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.4 km, while 3% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nPalermo is a key intersection on the Sicilian road network, being the junction between the eastern A19 motorway to Trapani, the southeastern A29 to airport and Mazara del Vallo and the southwestern A19 to Catania and A20 to Messina. Palermo is one of the main cities on European route E90. The three main national roads starting from Palermo are the SS113, SS121, SS186 and the SS624.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nPalermo International Airport, known as Falcone-Borsellino Airport (formerly Punta Raisi Airport), is located 32 km (20 mi) west of Palermo. It is dedicated to Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, two anti-mafia judges killed by the mafia in the early 1990s.\nThe airport's rail facility, known as Punta Raisi railway station, can be reached from Palermo Centrale, Palermo Notarbartolo and Palermo Francia railway stations.\nPalermo-Boccadifalco Airport is the second airport of the city.\n\n\n=== Port ===\n\nThe port of Palermo, founded by the Phoenicians over 2,700 years ago, is, together with the port of Messina, the main port of Sicily. From here ferries link Palermo to Cagliari, Genoa, Livorno, Naples, Tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually. It is also an important port for cruise ships. Traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes (5.5 million short tons) of cargo and 80,000 TEUs yearly. The port also has links to minor Sicilian islands such as Ustica and the Aeolian Islands (via Cefal\u00f9 in summer). Inside the Port of Palermo there is a section known as \"tourist marina\" for sailing yachts and catamarans.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== National rail ===\nThe main railway station of Palermo is Palermo Centrale which links to the other cities of Sicily, including Agrigento, Trapani and Catania, and through Messina and the strait to the rest of Italy.

        "wiki": "Sicily (Italian: Sicilia [si\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0lja]; Sicilian: Sicilia [s\u026a\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0lja]) is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 20 regions of Italy. It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. It has 5 million inhabitants.\nSicily is located in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula, from which it is separated by the narrow Strait of Messina. Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently 3,329 m (10,922 ft) high. The island has a typical Mediterranean climate.\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC. By around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the Sicilian Wars and the Punic Wars. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily. The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was subsequently ruled by the Hohenstaufen, the Capetian House of Anjou, Spain, and the House of Habsburg. It was unified under the House of Bourbon with the Kingdom of Naples as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It became part of Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, a revolt led by Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Italian unification, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an autonomous region on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the Italian constitutional referendum of 1946. However, much of the autonomy still remains unapplied, especially financial autonomy, because the autonomy-activating laws have been deferred to be approved by the joint committee (50% Italian State, 50% Regione Siciliana), since 1946.Sicily has a rich and unique culture, especially with regard to the arts, music, literature, cuisine, and architecture. It is also home to important archaeological and ancient sites, such as the Necropolis of Pantalica, the Valley of the Temples, Erice and Selinunte.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSicily has a roughly triangular shape, earning it the name Trinacria.\nTo the north-east, it is separated from Calabria and the rest of the Italian mainland by the Strait of Messina, about 3 km (1.9 mi) wide in the north, and about 16 km (9.9 mi) wide in the southern part. The northern and southern coasts are each about 280 km (170 mi) long measured as a straight line, while the eastern coast measures around 180 km (110 mi); total coast length is estimated at 1,484 km (922 mi). The total area of the island is 25,711 km2 (9,927 sq mi), while the Autonomous Region of Sicily (which includes smaller surrounding islands) has an area of 27,708 km2 (10,698 sq mi).\n\nThe terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and is intensively cultivated wherever possible. Along the northern coast, the mountain ranges of Madonie, 2,000 m (6,600 ft), Nebrodi, 1,800 m (5,900 ft), and Peloritani, 1,300 m (4,300 ft), are an extension of the mainland Apennines. The cone of Mount Etna dominates the eastern coast. In the southeast lie the lower Hyblaean Mountains, 1,000 m (3,300 ft). The mines of the Enna and Caltanissetta districts were part of a leading sulphur-producing area throughout the 19th century, but have declined since the 1950s.\nSicily and its surrounding small islands have some highly active volcanoes. Mount Etna is the largest active volcano in Europe and still casts black ash over the island with its ever-present eruptions. It currently stands 3,329 metres (10,922 ft) high, though this varies with summit eruptions; the mountain is 21 m (69 ft) lower now than it was in 1981. It is the highest mountain in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km (87 mi). This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. In Greek mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under the mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky. Mount Etna is widely regarded as a cultural symbol and icon of Sicily.\n\nThe Aeolian Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the northeast of mainland Sicily form a volcanic complex, and include Stromboli. \nThe three volcanoes of Vulcano, Vulcanello and Lipari are also currently active, although the latter is usually dormant. Off the southern coast of Sicily, the underwater volcano of Ferdinandea, which is part of the larger Empedocles volcano, last erupted in 1831. It is located between the coast of Agrigento and the island of Pantelleria (which itself is a dormant volcano).\nThe autonomous region also includes several neighbouring islands: the Aegadian Islands, the Aeolian Islands, Pantelleria and Lampedusa.\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\n\nThe island is drained by several rivers, most of which flow through the central area and enter the sea at the south of the island. The Salso flows through parts of Enna and Caltanissetta before entering the Mediterranean Sea at the port of Licata. To the east, the Alcantara flows through the province of Messina and enters the sea at Giardini Naxos, and the Simeto, which flows into the Ionian Sea south of Catania. Other important rivers on the island are the Belice and Platani in the southwest.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSicily has a typical Mediterranean climate with mild and wet winters and hot, dry summers with very changeable intermediate seasons. On the coasts, especially in the south-west, the climate is affected by the African currents and summers can be scorching.\nSicily is seen as an island of warm winters.\nSnow falls above 900\u20131000 metres, but it can fall in the hills. The interior mountains, especially Nebrodi, Madonie, and Etna, enjoy a full mountain climate, with heavy snowfalls during winter. The summit of Mount Etna is usually snow-capped from October to May.\nOn the other hand, especially in the summer, it is not unusual that there is the sirocco, the wind from the Sahara. Rainfall is scarce, and water proves deficient in some provinces where a water crisis can happen occasionally.\nAccording to the Regional Agency for Waste and Water, on 10 August 1999, the weather station of Catenanuova (EN) recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5 \u00b0C (119 \u00b0F). The official European record \u2013 measured by minimum/maximum thermometers \u2013 is held by Athens, Greece, which reported a maximum of 48.0 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) in 1977. Total precipitation is highly variable, generally increasing with elevation. In general, the southern and southeast coast receives the least rainfall (less than 50 cm (20 in)), and the northern and northeastern highlands the most (over 100 cm (39 in)).\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\nSicily is an often-quoted example of man-made deforestation, which has occurred since Roman times, when the island was turned into an agricultural region. This gradually dried the climate, leading to a decline in rainfall and the drying of rivers. The central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of any forest. In Northern Sicily, there are three important forests; near Mount Etna, in the Nebrodi Mountains and in the Bosco della Ficuzza's Natural Reserve near Palermo. The Nebrodi Mountains Regional Park, established on 4 August 1993 and covering 86,000 hectares (210,000 acres), is the largest protected natural area of Sicily; and contains the largest forest in Sicily, the Caronia. The Hundred Horse Chestnut (Castagno dei Cento Cavalli), in Sant'Alfio, on the eastern slopes of Mount Etna, is the largest and oldest known chestnut tree in the world at 2,000 \u2013 4,000 years old.Sicily has a wide variety of fauna. Species include fox, least weasel, pine marten, roe deer, girgentana, wild boar, crested porcupine, hedgehog, common toad, Vipera aspis, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, hoopoe and black-winged stilt.The Zingaro Natural Reserve is one of the best examples of unspoiled coastal wilderness in Sicily.Surrounding waters including the Strait of Messina are home to varieties of birds and marine life, including larger species such as flamingos and fin whales.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name Sicilia was given to the Roman province in 241 BC. It is derived from the name of the Sikeloi, who inhabited the eastern part of the island.\nThe ancient name of the island is Trinacria (Greek \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \"having three headlands\") for its triangular shape, likely a re-interpretation of earlier (Homeric) Thrinacia. \nThe Greek name was rendered as Tr\u012bn\u0101cr\u012da in classical Latin (Virgil, Ovid).\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nThe original classical-era inhabitants of Sicily comprised three defined groups of the ancient peoples of Italy. The most prominent and by far the earliest of these, the Sicani, who (Thucydides writes) arrived from the Iberian Peninsula (perhaps Catalonia). Some modern scholars, however, suggest classifying the Sicani as possibly an Illyrian tribe. Important historical evidence has been discovered in the form of cave drawings by the Sicani, dated from the end of the Pleistocene epoch around 8000 BC. The arrival of the first humans on the island correlates with the extinction of the Sicilian Hippopotamus and the dwarf elephant. The Elymians, thought to have come from the area of the Aegean Sea, became the next tribe to join the Sicanians on Sicily.\n\nRecent discoveries of dolmens on the island (dating to the second half of the third millennium BC) seem to offer new insights into the culture of primitive Sicily. It is well known that the Mediterranean region went through a quite intricate prehistory, so much so that it is difficult to piece together the muddle of different peoples who have followed each other. The impact of two influences is clear, however: the European one coming from the Northwest, and the Mediterranean influence of a clear eastern heritage.No evidence survives of any warring between the tribes, but the Sicanians moved eastwards when the Elymians settled in the northwest corner of the island. The Sicels are thought  to have originated in Liguria; they arrived from mainland Italy in 1200 BC and forced the Sicanians to move back across Sicily and to settle in the middle of the island. Other minor Italic groups who settled in Sicily included the Ausones (Aeolian Islands, Milazzo) and the Morgetes of Morgantina.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nThe Phoenician settlements in the western part of the island predates the Greeks. From about 750 BC, the Greeks began to live in Sicily (\u03a3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u2013 Sikelia), establishing many important settlements. The most important colony was in Syracuse; others were located at Akragas, Selinunte, Gela, Himera and Zancle. The native Sicani and Sicel peoples were absorbed into the Hellenic culture with relative ease, and the area became part of Magna Graecia along with the rest of southern Italy, which the Greeks had also colonised. Sicily was very fertile, and the successful introduction of olives and grape vines created a great deal of profitable trading. A significant part of Greek culture on the island was that of the Greek religion, and many temples were built throughout Sicily, including several in the Valley of the Temples at Agrigento.Politics on the island was intertwined with that of Greece; Syracuse became desired by the Athenians who set out on the Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian War. Syracuse gained Sparta and Corinth as allies and, as a result, the Athenian expedition was defeated. The Athenian army and ships were destroyed, with most of the survivors being sold into slavery.\n\nGreek Syracuse controlled eastern Sicily while Carthage controlled the West. The two cultures began to clash, leading to the Greek-Punic wars. Greece had begun to make peace with the Roman Republic in 262 BC, and the Romans sought to annexe Sicily as their republic's first province. Rome attacked Carthage's holdings in Sicily in the First Punic War and won, making Sicily the first Roman province outside of the Italian Peninsula by 242 BC.In the Second Punic War, the Carthaginians attempted to take back Sicily. Some of the Greek cities on the island sided with the Carthaginians. Archimedes, who lived in Syracuse, helped the Carthaginians, but was killed by the Romans after they invaded Syracuse in 213 BC. They failed, and Rome was even more unrelenting in its annihilation of the invaders this time; Roman consul M. Valerian told the Roman Senate in 210 BC that \"no Carthaginian remains in Sicily\".As the empire's granary, Sicily was an important province, divided into two quaestorships: Syracuse to the east and Lilybaeum to the west. Some attempt was made under Augustus to introduce the Latin language to the island, but Sicily was allowed to remain largely Greek in a cultural sense. The once prosperous and contented island went into sharp decline when Verres became governor of Sicily. In 70 BC, noted figure Cicero condemned the misgovernment of Verres in his oration In Verrem.The island was used as a base of power numerous times, being occupied by slave insurgents during the First and Second Servile Wars, and by Sextus Pompey during the Sicilian revolt. Christianity first appeared in Sicily during the years following AD 200; between this time and AD 313, Constantine the Great finally lifted the prohibition on Christianity, but not before a significant number of Sicilians had become martyrs, including Agatha, Christina, Lucy, and Euplius. Christianity grew rapidly in Sicily over the next two centuries. The period of history during which Sicily was a Roman province lasted for around 700 years.The Western Roman Empire began falling apart after the great invasion of Vandals, Alans, and Sueves across the Rhine on the last day of 406. Eventually the Vandals, after roaming about western and southern Spain for 20 years moved to North Africa in 429. They occupied Carthage in 439 (The Franks moved south from Belgium. The Visigoths moved west and were eventually settled in Aquitaine in 418; the Burgundians were settled in Savoy in 443). This put them in a position to threaten Sicily only 100 miles away. After taking Carthage the Vandals personally led by King Gaiseric laid siege to Palermo in 440 as the opening act in an attempt to wrest the island from Roman rule personally. The Vandals made another attempt to take the island one year after the sack of Rome in 455, at Agrigento, but were defeated decisively by Ricimir in a naval victory off Corsica in 456. The island remained under Roman rule until 469. The Vandal possession of the island was lost 8 years later in 477 to the East Germanic tribe Ostrogoths who were in control of Italy and Dalmatia. The island was returned for payment of tribute to Odoacer, king of the Ostrogoths. He ruled Italy from 476\u201388 in the name of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor. The Vandals kept a toehold in Lilybaeum, a port on the west coast. They lost this in 491 after making one last attempt to conquer the island from this port. The Ostrogothic conquest of Sicily (and Italy as a whole) under Theodoric the Great began in 488. He had been appointed viceroy of the emperor to rule in Italy. The Goths were Germanic, but Theodoric was supportive of Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In 461 from the age of seven or eight until 17 or 18 he was a hostage; he resided in the great palace of Constantinople and was favored by Leo I and where he learned to read and write and do arithmetic.\n\n\n=== Byzantine period (535\u2013965) ===\n\nAfter taking areas occupied by the Vandals in North Africa, Justinian decided to retake Italy as an ambitious attempt to recover the lost provinces in the West. The re-conquests marked an end to over 150 years of accommodationist policies with tribal invaders. His first target was Sicily (known as the Gothic War (535\u2013554) began between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire). His general Belisarius was assigned the task. Sicily was used as a base for the Byzantines to conquer the rest of Italy, with Naples, Rome, Milan. It took five years before the Ostrogoth capital Ravenna fell in 540. However, the new Ostrogoth king Totila counterattacked, moving down the Italian peninsula, plundering and conquering Sicily in 550. Totila was defeated and killed in the Battle of Taginae by Byzantine general Narses in 552 but Italy was in ruins.At the time of the reconquest Greek was still the predominant language spoken on the island. Sicily was invaded by the Arab forces of Caliph Uthman in 652, but the Arabs failed to make any permanent gains. They returned to Syria with their booty. Raids seeking loot continued until the mid-8th century.The Eastern Roman Emperor Constans II decided to move from Constantinople to Syracuse in 660. The following year he launched an assault from Sicily against the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, which occupied most of southern Italy. Rumors that the capital of the empire was to be moved to Syracuse probably cost Constans his life, as he was assassinated in 668. His son Constantine IV succeeded him. A brief usurpation in Sicily by Mezezius was quickly suppressed by this emperor. Contemporary accounts report that the Greek language was widely spoken on the island during this period. In 740 Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred Sicily from the jurisdiction of the church of Rome to that of Constantinople, placing the island within the eastern branch of the Church.In 826 Euphemius, the Byzantine commander in Sicily, having apparently killed his wife, forced a nun to marry him. Emperor Michael II caught wind of the matter and ordered general Constantine to end the marriage and cut off Euphemius' head. Euphemius rose up, killed Constantine, and then occupied Syracuse; he, in turn, was defeated and driven out to North Africa. He offered the rule of Sicily to Ziyadat Allah, the Aghlabid Emir of Tunisia, in return for a position as a general and a place of safety. A Muslim army was then sent to the island consisting of Arabs, Berbers, Cretans, and Persians.The Muslim conquest of Sicily was a see-saw affair and met with fierce resistance. It took over a century for Byzantine Sicily to be conquered; the largest city, Syracuse, held out until 878 and the Greek city of Taormina fell in 962. It was not until 965 that all of Sicily was conquered by the Arabs. In the 11th-century Byzantine armies carried out a partial reconquest of the island under George Maniakes, but it was their Norman mercenaries who would eventually complete the island's reconquest at the end of the century.\n\n\n=== Arab Period (827\u20131091) ===\n\nThe Arabs initiated land reforms, which increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, undermining the dominance of the latifundia. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems. The language spoken in Sicily under Arab rule was Siculo-Arabic and Arabic influence is still present in some Sicilian words today. Although the language is extinct in Sicily, it has developed into what is now the Maltese language on the islands of Malta today.\n\nA description of Palermo was given by Ibn Hawqal, an Arab merchant who visited Sicily in 950. A walled suburb, called the Al-Kasr (the palace), is the centre of Palermo to this day, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman cathedral. The suburb of al-Khalisa (modern Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqal reckoned 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. Palermo was initially ruled by the Aghlabids; later it was the centre of Emirate of Sicily under the nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid Caliphate. During the reign of this dynasty revolts by Byzantine Sicilians continuously occurred especially in the east where Greek-speaking Christians predominated. Parts of the island were re-occupied before revolts were being quashed. During Muslim rule agricultural products such as oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane were brought to Sicily. Under the Arab rule the island was divided in three administrative regions, or \"vals\", roughly corresponding to the three \"points\" of Sicily: Val di Mazara in the west; Val Demone in the northeast; and Val di Noto in the southeast. As dhimmis, that is as members of a protected class of approved monotheists the Eastern Orthodox Christians were allowed freedom of religion, but had to pay a tax, the jizya (in lieu of the obligatory alms tax, the zakat, paid by Muslims), and were restricted from active participation in public affairs.\nThe Emirate of Sicily began to fragment as intra-dynastic quarreling fractured the Muslim regime. During this time, there was also a small Jewish presence.\n\n\n=== Norman Sicily (1038\u20131198) ===\n\nIn 1038, seventy years after losing their last cities in Sicily, the Byzantines under the Greek general George Maniakes invaded the island together with their Varangian and Norman mercenaries. Maniakes was killed in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 before completing a reconquest and the Byzantines withdrew. The Normans invaded in 1061. After taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger was victorious at Misilmeri. Most crucial  was the siege of Palermo, whose fall in 1071 eventually resulted in all Sicily coming under Norman control. The conquest was completed in 1091 when they captured Noto the last Arab stronghold. Palermo continued to be the capital under the Normans.\nThe Norman Hauteville family, descendants of Vikings, appreciated and admired the rich and layered culture in which they now found themselves. They also introduced their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily adopted the habits and comportment of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, even to the extent of having palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Sicily ===\n\nRoger died in 1101. His wife Adelaide ruled until 1112 when their son Roger II of Sicily came of age. Having succeeded his brother Simon as Count of Sicily, Roger II was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings, which included the Maltese Islands and the Duchies of Apulia and Calabria.Roger II appointed the powerful Greek George of Antioch to be his \"emir of emirs\" and continued the syncretism of his father. During this period, the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe\u2014even wealthier than the Kingdom of England.The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, at the time when the culture was still heavily Arab and Greek. Governance was by rule of law which promoted justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together fairly amicably. During this time many extraordinary buildings were constructed.However this situation changed as the Normans under Papal pressure to secure the island imported immigrants from Lombardy, Piedmont, Provence and Campania. Linguistically, the island shifted from being one-third Greek- and two-thirds Arabic-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest to becoming fully Latinised. In terms of religion the island became completely Roman Catholic (bearing in mind that until 1054 the Churches owing allegiance to the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople belonged to one Church); Sicily before the Norman conquest was under Eastern Orthodox Patriarch. After Pope Innocent III made him Papal Legate in 1098, Roger I created several Catholic bishoprics while still allowing the construction of 12 Greek-speaking monasteries (the Greek language, monasteries, and 1500 parishes continued to exist until the adherents of the Greek Rite were forced in 1585 to convert to Catholicism or leave; a small pocket of Greek-speakers still live in Messina).\n\n\n=== Hohenstaufen dynasty ===\n\nAfter a century, the Norman Hauteville dynasty died out; the last direct descendant and heir of Roger, Constance, married Emperor Henry VI. This eventually led to the crown of Sicily being passed on to the Hohenstaufen Dynasty, who were Germans from Swabia. The last of the Hohenstaufens, Frederick II, the only son of Constance, was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the Middle Ages. His mother's will had asked Pope Innocent III to undertake the guardianship of her son.  Frederick was four when at Palermo, he was crowned King of Sicily in 1198. Frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of Palermo. There he picked up the many languages he heard spoken, such as Arabic and Greek, and learned some of the lore of the Jewish community. At age twelve, he dismissed Innocent's deputy regent and took over the government; at fifteen he married Constance of Aragon, and began his reclamation of the imperial crown. Subsequently, due to Muslim rebellions, Frederick II destroyed the remaining Muslim presence in Sicily, estimated at 60,000 persons, moving all to the city of Lucera in Apulia between 1221 and 1226.Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led, in 1266, to Pope Innocent IV crowning the French prince Charles, count of Anjou and Provence, as the king of both Sicily and Naples.\n\n\n=== Sicily under Aragonese rule ===\n\nStrong opposition to French officialdom due to mistreatment and taxation saw the local peoples of Sicily rise up, leading in 1282 to an insurrection known as the War of the Sicilian Vespers, which eventually saw almost the entire French population on the island killed. During the war, the Sicilians turned to Peter III of Aragon, son-in-law of the last Hohenstaufen king, for support after being rejected by the Pope. Peter gained control of Sicily from the French, who, however, retained control of the Kingdom of Naples. A crusade was launched in August 1283 against Peter III and the Kingdom of Aragon by Pope Martin IV (a pope from \u00cele-de-France), but it failed. The wars continued until the peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, which saw Peter's son Frederick III recognized as the king of the Isle of Sicily, while Charles II was recognized as the king of Naples by Pope Boniface VIII. Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives of the kings of Aragon until 1409 and then as part of the Crown of Aragon. In October 1347, in Messina, Sicily, the Black Death first arrived in Europe.Between the 15th-18th centuries, waves of Greeks from the Peloponnese (such as the Maniots) and Arvanites migrated to Sicily in large numbers to escape persecution after the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese. They brought with them Eastern Orthodoxy as well as the Greek and Arvanitika languages to the island, once again adding onto the extensive Byzantine/Greek influence.\n\nThe onset of the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 led to Ferdinand II decreeing the expulsion of all Jews from Sicily. The eastern part of the island was hit by very destructive earthquakes in 1542 and 1693. Just a few years before the latter earthquake, the island was struck by a ferocious plague. The earthquake in 1693 took an estimated 60,000 lives. There were revolts during the 17th century, but these were quelled with significant force, especially the revolts of Palermo and Messina. North African slave raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 saw Sicily assigned to the House of Savoy; however, this period of rule lasted only seven years, as it was exchanged for the island of Sardinia with Emperor Charles VI of the Austrian Habsburg Dynasty.While the Austrians were concerned with the War of the Polish Succession, a Bourbon prince, Charles from Spain was able to conquer Sicily and Naples. At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union, while the Bourbons ruled over both from Naples. However, the advent of Napoleon's First French Empire saw Naples taken at the Battle of Campo Tenese and Bonapartist King of Naples were installed. Ferdinand III the Bourbon was forced to retreat to Sicily which he was still in complete control of with the help of British naval protection.Following this, Sicily joined the Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently the British under Lord William Bentinck established a military and diplomatic presence on the island to protect against a French invasion. After the wars were won, Sicily and Naples formally merged as the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook control of the island and dominated it until 1860.\n\n\n=== Italian unification ===\n\nThe Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Sicily in 1860, as part of the Risorgimento. The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula. Garibaldi's march was completed with the Siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favour of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, Sicily became part of the kingdom on 17 March 1861.\nThe Sicilian economy (and the wider mezzogiorno economy) remained relatively underdeveloped after the Italian unification, in spite of the strong investments made by the Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. In 1894, organisations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island, but they were suppressed in a few days. The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed more than 80,000 people.This period was also characterized by the first contact between the Sicilian mafia (the crime syndicate also known as Cosa Nostra) and the Italian government. The Mafia's origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of bandits (Briganti) who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The Carabinieri (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the Italian army were often involved in terrible fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation between the mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st centuries ===\n\nIn the 1920s, the Fascist regime began a stronger military action against the Mafia, which was led by prefect Cesare Mori, who was known as the \"Iron Prefect\" because of his iron-fisted campaigns. This was the first time in which an operation against the Sicilian mafia ended with considerable success. There was an allied invasion of Sicily during World War II starting on 10 July 1943. In preparation for the invasion, the Allies revitalised the Mafia to aid them. The invasion of Sicily contributed to the 25 July crisis; in general, the Allied victors were warmly embraced by Sicily.Italy became a Republic in 1946 and, as part of the Constitution of Italy, Sicily was one of the five regions given special status as an autonomous region. Both the partial Italian land reform and special funding from the Italian government's Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (Fund for the South) from 1950 to 1984 helped the Sicilian economy. During this period, the economic and social condition of the island was generally improved thanks to important investments on infrastructures such as motorways and airports, and thanks to the creation of important industrial and commercial areas. In the 1980s, the Mafia was deeply weakened by a second important campaign led by magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Between 1990 and 2005, the unemployment rate fell from about 23% to 11%.The Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Sicily, especially around Palermo. A police investigation in summer 2019 also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area Sicilian Mafia and American organized crime, particularly the Gambino crime family. According to La Repubblica, \"Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned\".\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nSicily is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities, including the original Italic people, the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Swabians, Aragonese, Lombards, Spaniards, French, and Albanians, each contributing to the island's culture and genetic makeup. About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. According to ISTAT figures from 2017, show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total 5,029,615 population; Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe. As in the rest of Italy, the official language is Italian and the primary religion is Roman Catholicism.\n\n\n=== Emigration ===\n\nSince the Italian unification, Sicily, along with the entire south of the Italian peninsula has been strongly marked by coerced emigration, partly induced by a planned de-industrialization of the south in order to favour the northern regions.\nAfter Italian unification most of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies's former National Bank, the Banco delle Due Sicilie's assets were transferred to Piedmont. During the first decades of the Risorgimento, a rising number of Sicilian and South Italian manufacturies were driven into ruin due to high taxation imposed by the central government. Furthermore, an embargo imposed on goods coming from South Italian manufacturers, that effectively barred them from exporting to the north and abroad, were also key factors that led to further impoverishment of the entire region. South Italian and Sicilian emigration started shortly after the Unification of Italy and has not stopped ever since. By the beginning of the 1900s, less than 40 years after the Unification, what was formerly known as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, one of Europe's most industrialized countries, became one of the poorest regions in Europe.The aforementioned factors, along with a failed land reform, resulted in a never-before-seen wave of Sicilians emigrating, first to the United States between the 1880s and the 1920s, later to Northern Italy, and from the 1960s onwards also to Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, as well as Australia and South America.\nToday, Sicily is the Italian region with the highest number of expatriates:  as of 2017, 750,000 Sicilians, 14.4% of the island's population, lived abroad.  For lack of employment, every year many Sicilians, especially young graduates, still leave the island to seek jobs abroad. Today, an estimated 10 million people of Sicilian origins live around the world.\n\n\n=== Largest cities ===\nThe following table shows the ten largest cities of Sicily:\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAs in most Italian regions, Christian Roman Catholicism is the predominant religious denomination in Sicily, and the church still plays an important role in the lives of most people. There is also a notable small minority of Eastern-rite Byzantine Catholics which has a mixed congregation of ethnic Albanians; it is operated by the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. Most people still attend church weekly or at least for religious festivals, and many people get married in churches. There was a wide presence of Jews in Sicily for at least 1,400 years and possibly for more than 2,000 years. Some scholars believe that the Sicilian Jewry are partial ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews. However, much of the Jewish community faded away when they were expelled from the island in 1492. Islam was present during the Emirate of Sicily, although Muslims were also expelled. Today, mostly due to immigration to the island, there are also several religious minorities, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. There are also a fair number of evangelical Christians who live on the island.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Sicily takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Sicilian Regional Assembly. The capital of Sicily is Palermo.\nTraditionally, Sicily gives center-right results during elections. From 1943 to 1951 there was also a separatist political party called Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano, MIS). Its best electoral result was in the 1946 general election, when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all its seats following the 1948 general election and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the politics of Sicily. After World War II Sicily became a stronghold of the Christian Democracy, in opposition to the Italian Communist Party. The Communists and their successors (the Democratic Party of the Left, the Democrats of the Left and the present-day Democratic Party) had never won in the region until 2012. Sicily is now governed by a center-right coalition. Nello Musumeci is the current President since 2017.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nAdministratively, Sicily is divided into nine provinces, each with a capital city of the same name as the province. Small surrounding islands are also part of various Sicilian provinces: the Aeolian Islands (Messina), isle of Ustica (Palermo), Aegadian Islands (Trapani), isle of Pantelleria (Trapani) and Pelagian Islands (Agrigento).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThanks to the regular growth of the last years, Sicily is the eighth largest regional economy of Italy in terms of total GDP (see List of Italian regions by GDP). A series of reforms and investments on agriculture such as the introduction of modern irrigation systems have made this important industry competitive. In the 1970s there was a growth of the industrial sector through the creation of some factories. In recent years the importance of the service industry has grown for the opening of several shopping malls and for modest growth of financial and telecommunication activities. Tourism is an important source of wealth for the island thanks to its natural and historical heritage. Today Sicily is investing a large amount of money on structures of the hospitality industry, in order to make tourism more competitive. However, Sicily continues to have a GDP per capita below the Italian average and higher unemployment than the rest of Italy. This difference is mostly caused by the negative influence of the Mafia that is still active in some areas although it is much weaker than in the past.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nSicily has long been noted for its fertile soil due to volcanic eruptions. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, citrons, oranges (Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP), lemons, tomatoes (Pomodoro di Pachino IGP), olives, olive oil, artichokes, prickly pear (Fico d'India dell'Etna DOP), almonds, grapes, pistachios (Pistacchio di Bronte DOP) and wine. Cattle and sheep are raised. The cheese productions are particularly important thanks to the Ragusano DOP and the Pecorino Siciliano DOP. Ragusa is noted for its honey (Miele Ibleo) and chocolate (Cioccolato di Modica IGP) productions.Sicily is the third largest wine producer in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The region is known mainly for fortified Marsala wines. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese used to make the Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily high quality wines are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.Sicily is also known for its liqueurs, such as the Amaro Averna produced in Caltanissetta and the local limoncello.\nFishing is another fundamental resource for Sicily. There are important tuna, sardine, swordfish and European anchovy fisheries. Mazara del Vallo is the largest fishing centre in Sicily and one of the most important in Italy.\n\n\n=== Industry and manufacturing ===\n\nImprovements in Sicily's road system have helped to promote industrial development. The region has three important industrial districts:\n\nCatania Industrial District, where there are several food industries and one of the best European electronics industry centres called Etna Valley (in honour of the best known Silicon Valley) which contains offices and factories of international companies such as STMicroelectronics and Numonyx;\nSyracuse Petrochemical District with chemical industries, oil refineries and important power stations (as the innovative Archimede combined cycle power plant);\nthe latest Enna Industrial District in which there are food industries.In Palermo there are important shipyards (such as Fincantieri), mechanical factories of famous Italian companies as Ansaldo Breda, publishing and textile industries. Chemical industries are also in the Province of Messina (Milazzo) and in the Province of Caltanissetta (Gela).\nThere are petroleum, natural gas and asphalt fields in the Southeast (mostly near Ragusa) and massive deposits of halite in Central Sicily. The Province of Trapani is one of the largest sea salt producers in Italy.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n\n==== GDP growth ====\nA table showing Sicily's different GDP (nominal and per capita) growth between 2000 and 2008:\n\n\n==== Economic sectors ====\nAfter the table which shows Sicily's GDP growth, this table shows the sectors of the Sicilian economy in 2006:\n\n\n==== Unemployment rate ====\nThe unemployment rate stood at 21.5% in 2018 and was one of the highest in Italy and Europe.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nHighways have been built and expanded in the last four decades. The most prominent Sicilian roads are the motorways (known as autostrade) in the north of the island. Much of the motorway network is elevated on pillars due to the island's mountainous terrain. Other main roads in Sicily are the Strade Statali, such as the SS.113 that connects Trapani to Messina (via Palermo), the SS.114 Messina-Syracuse (via Catania) and the SS.115 Syracuse-Trapani (via Ragusa, Gela and Agrigento).\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nThe first railway in Sicily was opened in 1863 (Palermo-Bagheria) and today all of the Sicilian provinces are served by a network of railway services, linking to most major cities and towns; this service is operated by Trenitalia. Of the 1,378 km (856 mi) of railway tracks in use, over 60% has been electrified whilst the remaining 583 km (362 mi) are serviced by diesel engines. 88% of the lines (1.209 km) are single-track and only 169 km (105 mi) are double-track serving the two main routes, Messina-Palermo (Tyrrhenian) and Messina-Catania-Syracuse (Ionian), which are the main lines of this region. Of the narrow-gauge railways the Ferrovia Circumetnea is the only one that still operates, going round Mount Etna. From the major cities of Sicily, there are services to Naples, Rome and Milan; this is achieved by the trains being loaded onto ferries which cross the Strait.In Catania there is an underground railway service (metropolitana di Catania); in Palermo the national railway operator Trenitalia operates a commuter rail (Palermo metropolitan railway service), the Sicilian Capital is also served by 4 AMAT (Comunal Public Transport Operator) tramlines; Messina is served by a tramline.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\n\nMainland Sicily has several airports that serve numerous Italian and European destinations and some extra-European.\n\nCatania-Fontanarossa Airport, located on the east coast, is the busiest on the island (and one of the busiest in all of Italy).\nPalermo International Airport, which is also a substantially large airport with many national and international flights.\nTrapani-Birgi Airport, a military-civil joint-use airport (third for traffic on the island). Recently the airport has seen an increase in traffic thanks to a low-cost carrier.\nComiso-Ragusa Airport, has recently been refurbished and re-converted from military use to a civil airport. It was opened to commercial traffic and general aviation on 30 May 2013.\nPalermo-Boccadifalco Airport is the old airport of Palermo and is currently used for general aviation and as a base for the Guardia di Finanza and police helicopters.\nNAS Sigonella Airport, it is an Italian Air Force and US Navy installation.\nLampedusa Airport.\nPantelleria Airport.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\n\nBy sea, Sicily is served by several ferry routes and cargo ports, and in all major cities, cruise ships dock on a regular basis.\n\nMainland Italy: Ports connecting to the mainland are Messina (route to Villa San Giovanni and Salerno), the busiest passenger port in Italy, Palermo (routes to Genoa, Civitavecchia and Naples) and Catania (route to Naples).\nSicily's small surrounding islands: The port of Milazzo serves the Aeolian Islands, the ports of Trapani and Marsala the Aegadian Islands and the port of Porto Empedocle the Pelagie Islands. From Palermo there is a service to the island of Ustica and to Sardinia.\nInternational connections: From Palermo and Trapani there are weekly services to Tunisia and there is also a daily service between Malta and Pozzallo.\nCommercial and cargo ports: The port of Augusta is the fifth-largest cargo port in Italy and handles tonnes of goods. Other major cargo ports are Palermo, Catania, Trapani, Pozzallo and Termini Imerese.\nTouristic ports: Several ports along the Sicilian coast are in the service of private boats that need to moor on the island. The main ports for this traffic are in Marina di Ragusa, Riposto, Portorosa, Syracuse, Cefal\u00f9 and Sciacca. In Sicily, Palermo is also a major centre for boat rental, with or without crew, in the Mediterranean.\nFishing ports: Like all islands, Sicily also has many fishing ports. The most important is in Mazara del Vallo followed by Castellamare del Golfo, Licata, Scoglitti and Portopalo di Capo Passero.\n\n\n=== Planned bridge ===\n\nPlans for a bridge linking Sicily to the mainland have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, the Strait of Messina Bridge. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few years. On 6 March 2009, Silvio Berlusconi's government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge will begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of \u20ac1.3 billion as a contribution to the bridge's total cost, estimated at \u20ac6.1 billion.\nThe plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economical sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nSicily's sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, history, and architecture attract many tourists from mainland Italy and abroad. The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit the island all year round. Mount Etna, the beaches, the archaeological sites, and major cities such as Palermo, Catania, Syracuse and Ragusa are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of Taormina and the neighbouring seaside resort of Giardini Naxos draw visitors from all over the world, as do the Aeolian Islands, Erice, Castellammare del Golfo, Cefal\u00f9, Agrigento, the Pelagie Islands and Capo d'Orlando. The last features some of the best-preserved temples of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in Sicily, and many wine tourists also visit the island.\nSome scenes of several Hollywood and Cinecitt\u00e0 films were shot in Sicily. This increased the attraction of Sicily as a tourist destination.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ===\n\nThere are seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Sicily. By the order of inscription:\n\nValle dei Templi (1997) is one of the most outstanding examples of Greater Greece art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy. The site is located in Agrigento.\nVilla Romana del Casale (1997) is a Roman villa built in the first quarter of the 4th century and located about 3 km (2 mi) outside the town of Piazza Armerina. It contains the richest, largest and most complex collection of Roman mosaics in the world.\nAeolian Islands (2000) are a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea, named after the demigod of the winds Aeolus. The Aeolian Islands are a tourist destination in the summer, and attract up to 200,000 visitors annually.\nLate Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto (2002) \"represent the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe\". It includes several towns: Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa and Scicli.\nNecropolis of Pantalica (2005) is a large necropolis in Sicily with over 5,000 tombs dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC. Syracuse is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres and architecture. They are situated in south-eastern Sicily.\nMount Etna (2013) is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost constant state of activity and generated myths, legends and naturalistic observation from Greek, Celts and Roman classic and medieval times.\nArab-Norman Palermo and the cathedral churches of Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale; includes a series of nine civil and religious structures dating from the era of the Norman kingdom of Sicily (1130\u20131194)\n\n\n==== Tentative Sites ====\n\nTaormina and Isola Bella;\nMotya and Libeo Island: The Phoenician-Punic Civilisation in Italy;\nScala dei Turchi;\nStrait of Messina.\n\n\n=== Archeological sites ===\nBecause many different cultures settled, dominated or invaded the island, Sicily has a huge variety of archaeological sites. Also, some of the most notable and best preserved temples and other structures of the Greek world are located in Sicily.. Here is a short list of the major archaeological sites:\n\nSicels/Sicans/Elymians/Greeks: Segesta, Eryx, Cava Ispica, Thapsos, Pantalica;\nGreeks: Syracuse, Agrigento, Segesta, Selinunte, Gela, Kamarina, Himera, Megara Hyblaea, Naxos, Heraclea Minoa;\nPhoenicians: Motya, Soluntum, Marsala, Palermo;\nRomans: Piazza Armerina, Centuripe, Taormina, Palermo;\nArabs: Palermo, Mazara del Vallo.The excavation and restoration of one of Sicily's best known archaeological sites, the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, was at the direction of the archaeologist Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta, Fifth Duke of Serradifalco, known in archaeological circles simply as \"Serradifalco\". He also oversaw the restoration of ancient sites at Segesta, Selinunte, Siracusa and Taormina.\n\n\n=== Castles ===\nIn Sicily there are hundreds of castles, the most relevant are:\n\n\n=== Coastal towers ===\nThe Coastal towers in Sicily (Torri costiere della Sicilia) are 218 old watchtowers along the coast. In Sicily, the first coastal towers date back to 1313 and 1345 of the Aragonese monarchy. From 1360 the threat came from the south, from North Africa to Maghreb, mainly to Barbary pirates and corsairs of Barbary Coast. In 1516, the Turks settled in Algiers, and from 1520, the corsair Hayreddin Barbarossa under the command of Ottoman Empire, operated from that harbor.\nMost existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect Camillo Camilliani from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in '800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of Martello towers that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. \nThe decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the Second Barbary War led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th Century.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nTo have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.\n\nSicily has long been associated with the arts; many poets, writers, philosophers, intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island. The history of prestige in this field can be traced back to Greek philosopher Archimedes, a Syracuse native who has gone on to become renowned as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Gorgias and Empedocles are two other highly noted early Sicilian-Greek philosophers, while the Syracusan Epicharmus is held to be the inventor of comedy.\n\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n\nTerracotta ceramics from the island are well known, the art of ceramics on Sicily goes back to the original ancient peoples named the Sicanians, it was then perfected during the period of Greek colonisation and is still prominent and distinct to this day. Nowadays, Caltagirone is one of the most important centres in Sicily for the artistic production of ceramics and terra-cotta sculptures. Famous painters include Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina, Bruno Caruso, Renato Guttuso and Greek born Giorgio de Chirico who is commonly dubbed the \"father of Surrealist art\" and founder of the metaphysical art movement. The most noted architects are Filippo Juvarra (one of the most important figures of the Italian Baroque) and Ernesto Basile.\n\n\n==== Sicilian Baroque ====\n\nThe Sicilian Baroque has a unique architectural identity. Noto, Caltagirone, Catania, Ragusa, Modica, Scicli and particularly Acireale contain some of Italy's best examples of Baroque architecture, carved in the local red sandstone. Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily.\nThe Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterize in words.\n\n\n=== Music and film ===\n\nPalermo hosts the Teatro Massimo which is the largest opera house in Italy and the third largest in all of Europe.\nIn Catania there is another important opera house, the Teatro Massimo Bellini with 1,200 seats, which is considered one of the best European opera houses for its acoustics.\nSicily's composers vary from Vincenzo Bellini, Sigismondo d'India, Giovanni Pacini and Alessandro Scarlatti, to contemporary composers such as Salvatore Sciarrino and Silvio Amato.\n\nMany award-winning and acclaimed films of Italian cinema have been filmed in Sicily, amongst the most noted of which are: Visconti's \"La Terra Trema\" and \"Il Gattopardo\", Pietro Germi's \"Divorzio all'Italiana\" and \"Sedotta e Abbandonata\".\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the Sicilian School of Giacomo da Lentini, which was highly influential on Italian literature. Some of the most noted figures among writers and poets are Luigi Pirandello (Nobel laureate, 1934), Salvatore Quasimodo (Nobel laureate, 1959), Giovanni Verga (the father of the Italian Verismo), Domenico Tempio, Giovanni Meli, Luigi Capuana, Mario Rapisardi, Federico de Roberto, Leonardo Sciascia, Vitaliano Brancati, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Elio Vittorini, Vincenzo Consolo and Andrea Camilleri (noted for his novels and short stories with the fictional character Inspector Salvo Montalbano as protagonist). On the political side notable philosophers include Gaetano Mosca and Giovanni Gentile who wrote The Doctrine of Fascism. In terms of academic reflection, the historical and aesthetic richness as well as the multi-layered heterogeneity of Sicilian literature and culture have been first grasped methodologically and coined with the term of transculturality by German scholar of Italian studies Dagmar Reichardt who, after having published an extensive study on the literary work of Giuseppe Bonaviri, was awarded the International Premio Flaiano (\"Italianistica\") for a trilingual (English, Italian, German) collection about the European liminality of Sicily, Sicilian literature and Sicilian Studies.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nToday in Sicily most people are bilingual and speak both Italian and Sicilian, a distinct and historical Romance language. Some of the Sicilian words are loan words from Greek, Catalan, French, Arabic, Spanish and other languages. Dialects related to Sicilian are also spoken in Calabria and Salento; it had a significant influence on the Maltese language. However the use of Sicilian is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family) and in a majority of cases it is replaced by the so-called regional Italian of Sicily, an Italian dialect that is a kind of mix between Italian and Sicilian.Sicilian was an early influence in the development of the first Italian standard, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of Frederick II and his court of notaries, or Magna Curia, which, headed by Giacomo da Lentini, also gave birth to the Sicilian School, widely inspired by troubadour literature. Its linguistic and poetic heritage was later assimilated into the Florentine by Dante Alighieri, the father of modern Italian who, in his De vulgari eloquentia, claims that \"In effect, this vernacular seems to deserve higher praise than the others since all the poetry written by Italians can be called Sicilian\". It is in this language that appeared the first sonnet, whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself.\n\n\n=== Science ===\nCatania has one of the four laboratories of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (National Institute for Nuclear Physics) in which there is a cyclotron that uses protons both for nuclear physics experiments and for particle therapy to treat cancer (proton therapy). Noto has one of the largest radio telescopes in Italy that performs geodetic and astronomical observations. There are observatories in Palermo and Catania, managed by the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (National Institute for Astrophysics). In the Observatory of Palermo the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the first and the largest asteroid to be identified Ceres (today considered a dwarf planet) on 1 January 1801; Catania has two observatories, one of which is situated on Mount Etna at 1,800 metres (5,900 feet).Syracuse is also an experimental centre for the solar technologies through the creation of the project Archimede solar power plant that is the first concentrated solar power plant to use molten salt for heat transfer and storage which is integrated with a combined-cycle gas facility. All the plant is owned and operated by Enel. The touristic town of Erice is also an important science place thanks to the Ettore Majorana Foundation and Centre for Scientific Culture which\nembraces 123 schools from all over the world, covering all branches of science, offering courses, seminars, workshops, and annual meetings. It was founded by the physicist Antonino Zichichi in honour of another scientist of the island, Ettore Majorana known for the Majorana equation and Majorana fermions. Sicily's famous scientists include also Stanislao Cannizzaro (chemist), Giovanni Battista Hodierna and Niccol\u00f2 Cacciatore (astronomers).\n\n\n=== Education ===\nSicily has four universities:\n\nThe University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. Nowadays it hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Catania hosts also the Scuola Superiore, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aiming for excellence in education.\nThe University of Palermo is the island's second-oldest university. It was officially founded in 1806, although historical records indicate that medicine and law have been taught there since the late 15th century. The Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo botanical gardens) is home to the university's Department of Botany and is also open to visitors.\nThe University of Messina, founded in 1548 by Ignatius of Loyola. It is organized in 11 Faculties.\nThe Kore University of Enna founded in 1995, it is the latest Sicilian university and the first university founded in Sicily after the Italian Unification.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe island has a long history of producing a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed God's Kitchen because of this. Every part of Sicily has its speciality (e.g. Cassata is typical of Palermo although available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public. The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be healthy, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, aubergines, onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.\n\nThe most well-known part of Sicilian cuisine is the rich sweet dishes including ice creams and pastries. Cannoli (singular: cannolo), a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough filled with a sweet filling usually containing ricotta, is strongly associated with Sicily worldwide. Biancomangiare, biscotti ennesi (cookies native to Enna), braccilatte (a Sicilian version of doughnuts), buccellato, ciarduna, pignoli, Biscotti Regina, giurgiulena, frutta martorana, cassata, pignolata, granita, cuccidati (a variety of fig cookie; also known as buccellati) and cucc\u00eca are some notable sweet dishes.Like the cuisine of the rest of southern Italy, pasta plays an important part in Sicilian cuisine, as does rice; for example with arancine. As well as using some other cheeses, Sicily has spawned some of its own, using both cow's and sheep's milk, such as pecorino and caciocavallo. Spices used include saffron, nutmeg, clove, pepper, and cinnamon, which were introduced by the Arabs. Parsley is used abundantly in many dishes. Although Sicilian cuisine is commonly associated with sea food, meat dishes, including goose, lamb, goat, rabbit, and turkey, are also found in Sicily. It was the Normans and Swabians who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island. Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the Nero d'Avola made near the baroque of town of Noto.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe most popular sport in Sicily is football, which came to the fore in the late 19th century under the influence of the English. Some of the oldest football clubs in Italy are from Sicily: the three most successful are Palermo, Catania, and Messina, which have played 29, 17 and 5 seasons in the Serie A respectively. No club from Sicily has ever won Serie A, but football is still deeply embedded in local culture and all over Sicily most towns have a representative team.Palermo and Catania have a heated rivalry and compete in the Sicilian derby together. Palermo is the only team in Sicily to have played on the European stage, in the UEFA Cup. In the island, the most noted footballer is Salvatore Schillaci, who won the Golden Boot at the 1990 FIFA World Cup with Italy. Other noted players include Giuseppe Furino, Pietro Anastasi, Francesco Coco, Christian Rigan\u00f2, and Roberto Galia. There have also been some noted managers from the island, such as Carmelo Di Bella and Franco Scoglio.\nAlthough football is the most popular sport in Sicily, the island also has participants in other fields. Amatori Catania have competed in the top Italian national rugby union league called National Championship of Excellence. They have even participated at the European level in the European Challenge Cup. Competing in the basketball variation of Serie A is Orlandina Basket from Capo d'Orlando in the province of Messina, where the sport has a reasonable following. Various other sports that are played to some extent include volleyball, handball, and water polo. Previously, in motorsport, Sicily held the prominent Targa Florio sports car race that took place in the Madonie Mountains, with the start-finish line in Cerda. The event was started in 1906 by Sicilian industrialist and automobile enthusiast Vincenzo Florio, and ran until it was canceled due to safety concerns in 1977.From 28 September to 9 October 2005 Trapani was the location of Acts 8 and 9 of the Louis Vuitton Cup. This sailing race featured, among other entrants, all boats that took part in the 2007 America's Cup.\n\n\n=== Popular culture ===\n\nEach town and city has its own patron saint, and the feast days are marked by colourful processions through the streets with marching bands and displays of fireworks.\nSicilian religious festivals also include the presepe vivente (living nativity scene), which takes place at Christmas time. Deftly combining religion and folklore, it is a constructed mock 19th-century Sicilian village, complete with a nativity scene, and has people of all ages dressed in the costumes of the period, some impersonating the Holy Family, and others working as artisans of their particular assigned trade. It is normally concluded on Epiphany, often highlighted by the arrival of the magi on horseback.\nOral tradition plays a large role in Sicilian folklore. Many stories passed down from generation to generation involve a character named \"Giuf\u00e0\". Anecdotes from this character's life preserve Sicilian culture as well as convey moral messages.\nSicilians also enjoy outdoor festivals, held in the local square or piazza where live music and dancing are performed on stage, and food fairs or sagre are set up in booths lining the square. These offer various local specialties, as well as typical Sicilian food. Normally these events are concluded with fireworks. A noted sagra is the Sagra del Carciofo or Artichoke Festival, which is held annually in Ramacca in April. The most important traditional event in Sicily is the carnival. Famous carnivals are in Acireale, Misterbianco, Regalbuto, Patern\u00f2, Sciacca, Termini Imerese.\n\nThe Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: \u00d2pira d\u00ee pupi) is a marionette theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as the Song of Roland or Orlando furioso that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastor\u00ee (singers of tales) are rooted in the Proven\u00e7al troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionettists, such as the Greco of Palermo; the Canino of Partinico and Alcamo; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of Catania, Pennisi and Macri of Acireale, Profeta of Licata, Gargano and Grasso of Agrigento. One can, however, admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitr\u00e8 in Palermo. Other elaborate marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in Randazzo.\n\n\n=== Traditional items ===\n\nThe Sicilian cart is an ornate, colourful style of a horse or donkey-drawn cart native to Sicily. Sicilian wood carver George Petralia states that horses were mostly used in the city and flat plains, while donkeys or mules were more often used in rough terrain for hauling heavy loads. The cart has two wheels and is primarily handmade out of wood with iron components.\nThe Sicilian coppola is a traditional kind of flat cap typically worn by men in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the tascu began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a driving cap, usually worn by car drivers. The coppola is usually made in tweed. Today it is widely regarded as a definitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.\n\n\n=== Flag and emblem ===\n\nThe Flag of Sicily, regarded as a regional icon, was first adopted in 1282, after the Sicilian Vespers of Palermo. It is characterised by the presence of the triskeles in the middle, depicting the head of Medusa and three wheat ears representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily. In early mythology, when Medusa was slain and beheaded by Perseus, the Medusa head was placed in the centre of Athena's shield. Palermo and Corleone were the first two cities to found a confederation against the Angevin rule. The triskeles symbol came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during World War II when Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The colours, likewise introduced in the 1940s, respectively represent the cities of Palermo and Corleone. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the center of it. When World War II ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic. \nThe flag became the official public flag of the Regione Siciliana in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite regional law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national Italian flag and the European one.\nFamiliar as an ancient symbol of the region, the Triskelion is also featured on Greek coins of Syracuse, such as coins of Agathocles (317\u2013289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial extension of Greece beyond the Aegean. The triskelion was revived, as a neoclassic \u2013 and non-Bourbon \u2013 emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, by Joachim Murat in 1808. In the case of Sicily, the triskelion symbol is said to represent the three capes (headlands or promontories of the island of Sicily, namely: Pelorus (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); Pachynus (Passero, Syracuse: South); and Lilyb\u00e6um (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of islands of Italy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Geographic data related to Sicily at OpenStreetMap\nSicilian Region \u2014 Official website (in Italian)\nSicily Transportation Map\n10 Reasons To Visit Sicily \u2013 Part I\n10 Reasons To Visit Sicily \u2013 Part II\nImages of Sicily\n10.000 Images of Sicily\nThe Sicilian tourist magazine\nThe Wonders of Sicily \u2013 The Cities, Architecture, Culture, History, People\nPiccolo, Salvatore (2018).

        "wiki": "St. Francis of Assisi Church (German: Kirche zum heiligen Franz von Assisi), also known as the Emperor's Jubilee Church (German: Kaiserjubil\u00e4umskirche) and the Mexico Church (German: Mexikokirche), is a Basilica-style Catholic church in Vienna, Austria. Built between 1898 and 1910, it was consecrated in 1913. It is located on the Mexikoplatz in Vienna's Second District, Leopoldstadt, and is administered by the Order of the Holy Trinity.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe construction of the church celebrated the 50th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. A competition was held to select the design and was won by architect Victor Luntz. The four-bay, basilica-like brick building was intended as a garrison church; designed in the Rhenish-Romanesque style, its three red-tiled towers are visible several kilometres away.\nThe church, which is directly situated near the Danube, is now home to the Vienna English Speaking Catholic Community (VESCC) who have held weekly masses at the church since moving there in 2009.The Mexikoplatz (Mexico Square), formerly known as Erzherzog-Karl-Platz (Archduke-Karl-Square), commemorates the fact that Mexico was the only country outside the Soviet Union to protest against the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany.\n\n\n== Elisabethkapelle ==\n\nThe Art Nouveau-style Elisabethkapelle (Elizabeth Chapel) is located on the left of the church next to the choir. It is 13.5 meters high and 10 metres wide. The octagonal chapel is modeled on the Palatine Chapel in the Aachen Cathedral, which was itself modelled on the Cappella Palatina in Palermo.In 1898, the Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni assassinated the wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Empress Elisabeth of Austria (commonly referred to as Sisi). To commemorate her, the Elisabethkapelle was established. It was financed through donations from the Red Cross, as Empress Elisabeth was the first Protector of the Red Cross.Because of the Red Cross' large donation of 348,348 crowns, the chapel was decorated with gold mosaics rather than frescoes, and the walls were covered in marble rather than stucco. The mosaics were designed by Secession artist Carl Ederer. On the vault of the chancel there is a large mosaic of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary.\nThe chapel was completed in 1907 and consecrated on 10 June 1908.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nVienna English Speaking Catholic Community (VESCC)\nThe Church of St. Francis of Assisi (The World Factbook)",

          "This is a pure place. Unadorned except for the frescoes which are magnificent. You will find solitude, a place to pray, and incredibly beautiful views. While I was there, and praying a group of backpackers from Germany sang an impromptu a cappella song of praise. Heaven must be",

        "wiki": "Homies are a series of two-inch plastic collectible figurines representing various Chicano Mexican American characters. The line of toys was created by David Gonzales and based on a comic strip that Gonzales created featuring a cast of characters from his youth. Introduced in the year 1998, Homies were initially sold in grocery store vending machines and have become a highly collectible item, and have spawned many imitation toys.\n\n\n== Background ==\nGonzales began drawing comics while he was in high school. His amateur comic strip was called The Adventures of Chico Loco, and the characters were based on \"barrio guys,\" as Gonzales grew up on the tough streets of a poverty-ridden Mexican-American neighborhood. The main character, based on Gonzales himself, was called \"Hollywood.\" The strip, which later changed its title to The Adventures of Hollywood, was picked up by Lowrider magazine and published monthly. More and more barrio characters from Gonzales' experiences were introduced to the public through the Hollywood strip \u2014 these became \"Homies.\" (The word \"homie\" [from \"homeboy\"] is an African-American slang from the southern United States, meaning someone from \"back home\".  In use in the West Coast Latino community for decades, the word \"homie\" has crossed over into the mainstream culture.)\nGonzales began drawing his humorous characters on T-shirts and other products, which he and his wife sold on local beach stands, swap meets, liquor stores, and eventually urban clothing stores.In 1998, Gonzales released the first set of Homies figurines, initially sold in supermarket vending machines located in Chicano communities. The first series featured the male characters Eight Ball, Smiley, Big Loco, Droopy, Sapo, and Mr. Raza. The toys were widely popular, with the first series selling a million Homies figures in four months.The figures caused controversy after their initial release as members of the Los Angeles Police Department argued that the \"urban, inner-city Latino\" figures glorified gang life. Law enforcement entities pressured retailers to stop selling Homies; as a result, many mainstream stores, such as Walmart and Safeway Inc., stopped selling the toys.In response, Gonzales repeatedly explained that he \u201cdid not create Homies to glamorize gang life\u201d. He created stories for each of the characters on the Homies website, with each one embodying a positive trait. Stores quickly returned the Homies to their shelves; the resulting media coverage of the controversy helped Homies gain ever more popularity.According to Gonzales, he has received orders from countries in Europe, South America, and Africa requesting Homies characters representing people from those continents. By 2005, the Homies line featured female characters, as well as characters with Puerto Rican, Filipino, and Japanese backgrounds. There have been 12 series of Homies, with more than 200 characters.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn their fictional world, the Homies are a group of tightly knit Chicano buddies who grew up in the Mexican-American barrio of \"Quien Sabe\" (\"Who knows?\") located in East Los Angeles. In an inner-city world plagued by poverty, violence, and drugs, the Homies form a strong and binding cultural support system that enables them to overcome the surrounding negativity, allowing for laughter and good times as an antidote to reality. As befitting these characters from the barrio, many Homies wear bandanas and baggy pants. The four main Homies are Hollywood (based on creator Gonzales), Smiley, Pelon, and Bobby Loco.\n\n\n=== Characters ===\nGonzales has created a background for each Homie to have their own story. He made sure that the Homies were authentic because they were based on Latinos in his community. The following is a list of some of the more notable Homies characters:\n\nFirst series:\nEight Ball \u2014 Known for his distinctive low-slung beanie and big smile, he is named for the numbers painted on his shoes\nSmiley \u2014 based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, Smiley is a mechanic who works at \"Homies Hydraulics,\" and is perpetually broke and borrowing money off the other Homies\nBig Loco \u2014 youth gang counselor and arbitrator\nDroopy \u2014 slightly stoned background character\nSapo \u2014 huge consumer of Mexican food; unpopular with women\nMr. Raza \u2014 highly educated, with degrees in Chicano Studies and Latin American and Pre-Columbian History\nSubsequent series:\nHollywood \u2014 based on creator David Gonzales, Hollywood is known by his zoot suit and 1970s disco hairstyle\nLa Gata (\"The Cat\") \u2014 Hollywood's girlfriend, she is loosely based on creator David Gonzales' wife\nPelon \u2014 based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, Pelon (\"bald\" in Spanish) is named for his bald head. A small-time hustler, Pelon sells stolen merchandise from the back of his 1941 Chevy panel sedan. Smiley's best friend, Pelon is the most stereotypically cholo of the Homies.\nBobby Loco \u2014 based on a childhood friend of creator David Gonzales, he is a bouncer at the \"Homie Hot Spot\"\nChuco \u2014 short for \"Pachuco,\" a lowriding, zoot suit-wearing Chicano from the 1940s and 50s\nJoker \u2014 true to his name, an inveterate clown and jokester\nEl Paletero \u2014 ice cream vendor who works to bring his grandchildren from Mexico\nOfficer Placa \u2014 chubby police officer who knows all the Homies by name\nEl Padrecito (\"the little father\") \u2014 Franciscan priest in sunglasses, based on creator David Gonzales' brother Robert (who is a priest)\nEl Profe \u2014 a Master's degree-qualified high school teacher who stays in the barrio to help\nShady \u2014 mother who works as a stripper to support her son\nWillie G \u2014 ex-gangster who works as a counsellor, trying to turn children away from crime. Paralyzed form the waist down as the result of gang violence.\nWhisper \u2014 half-Spanish and half-Sicilian, she is related to The Palermos\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nThe LAPD's complaints about the Homies figures were based on the characters' appearances. Since gang members are usually depicted in similar clothes as those of the Homies, the police felt the toys promoted gang life. In fact, the Homies figures so closely matched gang members' attire that an L.A. county district deputy attorney was inclined to use the Homies toys as an example of what not to wear. He suggested that people who were dressed in such a manner would be considered as violating probation.Similarly, Latino advocacy groups such as the Imagen Foundation objected to the Homies portrayal of Chicanos as \"gang members, undocumented, or drug dealers.\" Other groups felt the Homies perpetuated gross stereotypes about Chicanos.On the other hand, the Homies toy line has been shown to help Latin American adolescents with their cultural identity and self-esteem. As the toy line has expanded, the various characters carry a much greater range of lifestyle choices and possibilities.Another positive way the Homies toys have influenced society is via Gonzales\u2019s brother, Robert, who after a life of crime and violence, became a priest. Himself confined to a wheelchair, Robert suggested that Gonzales create a Homie in a wheelchair. Willie G, as the character was named, has since become one of the more popular Homies, even being promoted by the Special Olympics. The Homie character Padrecito (\"priest\") resembles Robert, and has been used to connect with and help those looking for a route out of the ghetto. Through \u201cEl Padrecito\u2019s Online Church,\u201d Homies have made it easier for society to connect with those looking to improve their lives; on the website people can create religious figurines, such as saints.In 2007, the Pasadena Museum of California Art produced an exhibition called \u201cBeyond Ultraman: Seven Artists Explore the Vinyl Frontier,\" which featured the Homies characters.Since they're roughly 1/32 in scale, and are cheaper and more readily available than the figures purpose-manufactured for the hobby, Homies and Gonzales' other figures are sometimes used in the scenery of slot car layouts.\n\n\n== Spin-offs and ancillary products ==\nHomies characters have been featured on school folders, lunchboxes, breath mints, and beach towels. Homies have also been seen  on posters, stickers, and clothing, and in YouTube videos.With their rising popularity, the Homies line branched out to include die-cast cars, among other things. In 2004, Gonzales created Mijos, a line of figurines portrayed as Latino kids, babies, and teens intended for a younger customer base.Other spin-off toys include The Palermos, a line featuring a fictional Italian American former mafia family now running a pizzeria; and a Trailer Park series.\nAmerican Dad shows Stan breaking a faberge egg and saying, \"I thought it would have candy or at least a little homie in there.\"\n\n\n== In other media ==\nIn the Season 1 finale episode of The Venture Bros, \"Return to Spider-Skull Island\", Dr. Orpheus acquires a \"Homeboy\" figurine from a diner's vending machine, a clear reference to the Homies figures.\nIn 2007, LATV produced a stop-motion animated show about the figures called The Homies Hip Hop Show. Featuring the voices of Karen Anzoategui, Eduardo Arenas, and Wendy Carrillo, the show went straight to DVD.\nIn 2008, the Homie Rollerz video game was released on the Nintendo DS.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nEl Padrecito Ministries",

        "wiki": "The Politeama Theatre (Italian: Teatro Politeama, complete name Teatro Politeama Garibaldi) is a theatre of Palermo. It is located in the central Piazza Ruggero Settimo and represents the second most important theatre of the city after the Teatro Massimo. It houses the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1864 the municipality of Palermo launched an international competition for the construction of a monumental opera house (the Teatro Massimo) and, a year later, an internal competition for the construction of a diurnal multi-purpose theatre  (hence the name \"Politeama\" from the Greek language).The architectural project was assigned to Giuseppe Damiani Almeyda. The theatre would have to be built on the border of the monumental structure of Palermo, as an ideal point of reference of the city's expansion. Therefore, unlike the \"aristocratic\" Teatro Massimo, the Politeama would have to house more popular shows (operetta, festivals, equestrian shows, etc.).\n\nThen, it was decided to erect a large opencast amphitheatre at the beginning of Viale della Libert\u00e0. In 1865 the contract with the construction company Galland was signed, but the construction started only in 1867. A year later the project was modified because it was decided to transform the amphitheatre into a real theatrical house. In the meantime, the work slow down due to problems that have arisen between the municipality and the Galland company.In 1869 the municipality decided to name the building after Gioachino Rossini, but later this intention was dismissed. On 7 June 1874 the theatre was inaugurated with the opera I Capuleti e i Montecchi of Vincenzo Bellini. However, the building wasn't complete yet. During the following years the name of the building was simply \"Teatro Municipale Politeama\". In 1882 Giuseppe Garibaldi died and the theatre was named after him.Even though the covering had been made in 1877 by the Fonderia Oretea, the last interventions were completed in 1891, when Palermo hosted the Esposizione Nazionale. At that time dates back the official opening in the presence of King Umberto I of Italy and of Queen Margherita. On that occasion Francesco Tamagno was the protagonist of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello.Between 1910 and 2006 the foyer of the theatre was home of the Galleria d'arte moderna di Palermo. The Politeama is the headquarters of the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana since 2001.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe building is an important example of Neoclassical architecture. It has a large entrance by way of triumphal arch topped by the bronze quadriga designed by Mario Rutelli. This quadriga depicts the \"Triumph of Apollo and Euterpe\" flanked by two statues of knights on horseback, representation of the \"Olympic Games\", work of Benedetto Civiletti. On both sides of the entrance there are commemorative plaques recording the epigraphs dictated by the historian Isidoro La Lumia. At the top there are two bass reliefs depicting the \"Fames\" draw by the painter Giuseppe Pensabene and another, under the quadriga, depicting little angels, work of Mario Rutelli.Around the entrance a semicircular structure develops with two orders of colonnade. A rich polychrome decoration, both within and outside the theatre, was made by eminent local painters like Nicol\u00f2 Giannone, Luigi Di Giovanni, Michele Corteggiani, Giuseppe Enea, Rocco Lentini, Enrico Cavallaro, Carmelo Giarrizzo, Francesco Padovano, Giovanni Nicolini and Gustavo Mancinelli. In the lateral gardens there are the sculptures of a Bacchante (work of Valerio Villareale), of a Sylph (work of Benedetto De Lisi) and of David (work of Antonio Ugo).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrchestra Sinfonica Siciliana\nPiazza Ruggero Settimo\nPiazza Castelnuovo\nTeatro Massimo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Image gallery\n(in Italian) Profile of the theatre - arte.it\n(in Italian) History of the theatre - Provincia Regionale di Palermo",

          "Palermo has two Opera houses. This one and Teatro Massimo. Teatro Politeama is completely different to the opera houses we are used to. This opera house is older than Teatro Massimo and well worth a visit. You can get to this opera house by making use of the Palermo Artour",

          "The theater is not very big and so it is very enjoyable visiting because it is a guided visit, therefore you get to understand everything very well. The history is beautiful since in the beginning it was an arena like the Colosseo in Rome, and later on in the years it was",

          "The Politeama might have seen better times for its interior- but its external proportions are really superb - with a cluster of horses straining at their leashes to announce its presence across the Piazza from its domed roof. The hotel Garibaldi or Politeama are excellent",

          "I visited Palermo the first day of the year and the center was frantic during this period. I saw the Politeama during the night and it is a fantastic sight (I attached a photo).",
          "Its full name is Teatro Politeama Garibaldi. Its was built in the middle of the 19th century and should not be mistaken with Teatro Massimo, farther away. There is a large piazza in front of the theater. As this is in downtown Palermo, this is quite a busy square.",
          "We stayed right on the square, & our hotel room looked out at the theater. From our floor, you could see beautiful painted frescoes on the upper balconies surrounding the teatro. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go inside, but the outside is lovely. Bronze horses & riders on",
          "Honestly, it was depressing and sad to see this building in such poor condition. It looked very unkepted: garbage around, iron gate around it, broken windows, washed-out colours; a very tired looking building. Sadly, we were unable to go inside. We actually thought it was in",
          "We were here around Politeama (due to frequent bus changes that stop/start from Politeama square) for so many times, and every time it feels wonderfull! Trully impressive structure, in the very centre of the city. There was a concert preparing to start in front of the main",
          "In correspondence with the Politeama square and the heart of the city traffic, this is the most crowded and busy spot of the city. Here is the famous theater Politeama. Very scenic and architecturally beautiful, some sculptures placed on top of it and it is entirely decorated",
          "We stayed at the Politeama Palace Hotel right across the street from the theater. While we were unable to see the interior of the theater, we were treated to a performance of Beethoven's 6th Symphony in the plaza in front of the theater. We only had to open our windows to view",
          "The building is amazing, we couldn't stop to take pictures. We took a tour and the inside was fabulous it is worth to stop and just take it the view and the history of this building. My all time favorite in Palermo.",
          "A nice example of neoclassical architecture, this beautiful and imposing theater is the work of Giuseppe Damiani Almeyda. It was inaugurated on June 7th, 1874, unfinished and without a roof, with Vincenzo Bellini's opera \"I Capuletti e I Montecchi\", a thrilling detail for Opera",
          "Interesting tour of the theater, pretty fabulous interior, but funding is drying up and I hope it can be saved.",
          "when I started my journey to Palermo, I didn't know where to stay, so I must have booked 30 hotels, true story, but I listened to Vagabonda to stay in the Politeama area. We chose Hotel Garibaldi and when we opened the door to the Balcony and the massive Testro was right in",
          "The Teatro Politeama is a very attractive structure. The location is very central with a large open space fronting the theatre. The overall environment is very satisfying. Worth a visit.",

          "Really awesome, and educational experience. I thought it was going to be scary, nevertheless it was an amazing experience.",
          "I would never take a child there. And I think it should not be a place classified as a tourist attraction. I felt very bad looking at those copses and skeletons. I would not like anyone from my family being exposed like that. I left before 3 minutes feeling desgastes and heavy",
          "A bizarre experience ! The catacombe houses around 8000 skeletons in their burial nooks/coffins, most dressed in the finery of the day. There are sections for men, women, priests, children and virgins \u2026. They date back to the 1700\u2019s - an incredible display. Entry costs 4 Euro -",
          "Very interesting to see how they preserved there dead, made you feel very close, not creepy and very well worth the visit, I can imagine how I could now look if preserved and put to rest in a similar place rather than being cremated",
          "A place that's macabre and creepy that's definitely not for everyone. If you think you can handle it is worth a visit, as it is an experience you definitely won't have experienced before. The ticket costs 3\u20ac.",
          "Not an ossuary but rather a disturbing display of mortal remains. Mummified remains are hung on the walls clothed in disintegrating tatters. It was really very bizarre and disturbing.",
          "Definitely not a universal tourist attraction. Only a small part of our group liked it, most of us did not, including me. If someone likes seeing macabre dead mummified bodies of children - 5 stars. If not, I definitely do not recommend. Taking photos is prohibited there, also",
          "It was interesting to see the corpses in standing position - not what I expected. Mostly skeletons, but some faces preserved, and various clothes fading - it was all fascinating. The entry fee is small, so it\u2019s worth the 15-20-minute visit.",
          "Fascinating - thrililng - a bit frigthening. See mummies of normal people, families (uncl, childen and babies), professionals, all in their original clothing, who were buried in the catacombs over the last centuries. Somy lying, some upright, some still with skin, some pure",
          "Fascinating but a bit macabre. Yes, there are dead bodies and yes, it's part of the history of the city but in hindsight I shouldn't have visited it. It felt a bit disrespectful being there as a tourist.",
          "This is not perhaps for anyone who is squeamish about seeing endless rows of the mummified dead, but it is an utterly fascinating, larger version of the same Order's crypt in Rome. Divided into sections and well laid out in terms of access and lighting, the remains vary from",
          "You would have thought it would be a very interesting place, though, in a very depressed and miserable part of the city, the Catacombe is a very weird store of fully day dressed dead people. Some really quite recent - circa 100 years. You couldn't really call it a display - just",
          "The Capuchin Catacombs is a creepy, gruesome burial site for thousands of mummified bodies and corpses. You descend into the enormous maze of underground catacombs of the monastery, to walk among the dead. Corpses (including babies) hang from the walls, are stacked on shelves,",
          "very interesting cemetry and museum where almost 1000 or more skeletons of dead people of the past are either stuck on the wall or displayed in special cases.You feel like you are on a horror movie.",
          "The catacombs are essentially a private cemetery which include bodies of monks and people who could afford to be buried here. The unusual thing is that the corpses are strung up and hung vertically along miles of corridors. It is a scene the likes of which you will never see",
          "People wanted to visit their beloved deceased family members after they had died, so many children and babies, too. Many hundreds of skeletons are all dressed up in their best clothes, all returning to dust. This is death and it is real.",
          "Dead people all around you. Very interesting but can get very scary for some. Still, one of the must see in Palermo.",
          "Not at all what I was expecting. Didn\u2019t realise there was a tradition of mummification in Europe. Brings out lots of words; sad, scary, comical and tragic are just a few. A place that has to be seen to be belived. The cemetery above it is also worth a stroll around.",
          "I found it fascinating. Bodies stuffed with straw, hanging on wires and dressed in their best clothes of the era. My friend thought they were wax dummies but no ..... Priests, business men, ladies of fashion 1800s and children of all ages. Apparently 6000 in total but a lot",
          "Can't say this was an enjoyable place. It's exactly what you expect, preserved bodies out in the open to be looked at. There is a minor amount of history about but it is not a museum. The point is to remind us to live a fruitful life.",
          "This may not be for the faint hearted since it is all dead bodies, but it is amazing to see! Some bodies are in a more mummified state than others. There are sections for monks, professional people and babies. Look at the different outfits that are on display? For obvious",
          "Underground crypt stacked with hundreds of corpses. Most of them are no more than skeletons but a certain amount of mummified flesh and hair still adheres to some. For the most part they're displayed upright, in their original clothes. There are monks, professional men, women",
          "Not sure how anyone can give this 5 stars. It's one of those 'attractions' that you go for the experience because you can. But there were no volunteers to go round a second time. It certainly presents death in all its finality. By the end I was happy for if to be over, and we",
          "Such a cool and different thing to do. A bit of a walk to get to, though. We met a man on a train who said that he fled this place after a few minutes due to the energy. Lol. My spouse, who absolutely hates anything scary, decided to come with me, and was perfectly fine. He",
          "As you wander the crypt hallways you can't help but wonder about past activity when families would spend time here visiting loved ones. I am glad this was one of my first stops, it helped me understand the significance of crypts at smaller churches in Italy. Take time to stroll",
          "We had been to the Capuchin catacombs in Rome which are definitely unusual and this place was equally so and even more ghoulish. I wanted to know more about the bodies that were displayed. Their clothes gave some clue, but not much. Most were anonymous. Strange place and not",
          "There are no toilets or cappuccinos available. Its lovely and cool down down down in there, buying the guide (E4) is an idea if you want to have any info. I just enjoyed looking at all the dead people. The kids will love this and just watch their shiny, arrogant, entitled",
          "We were in Palermo five days so made time to see this,if you are here only a few days I would skip this. It\u2019s a long walk from the centre but cheap to go in. So many more interesting places to visit. It\u2019s pretty Morbid and perhaps not nice for young children. My partner said",
          "Only \u20ac3 but when you\u2019ve seen one skull wrapped in material you\u2019ve seen them all. Slightly disturbing, and nothing to help guide you to different areas in English, so I didn\u2019t know what I was looking at. Skipped the queues and left pretty quickly....",
          "For people into weird, this is worth the six Euros. It\u2019s an easy 30 minute walk out the North Portal from the historic district. They ask that you not take photos but there are postcards for sale of the more interesting mummies.",
          "This is the most weird thing I have ever visited, skeltons everywhere fully clothed from children to adults. I'm not entirely sure how to describe the feeling you get whilst you are there, it goes from \"why am I looking at skeletons\" to creepy to finding the costumes and",
          "Macabre and fascinating well worth a visit and like nowhere else I have been a must see in Palermo and something you won\u2019t forget",
          "Firstly, I\u2019d advise walking there. You could probably use public transport, but by the time you\u2019ve waited for it, you could have got there on foot. From the Quattro Canti, it will probably take 25 mins to walk it. The place itself is fascinating, but leave your selfie stick at",
          "Underground tunnels filled with rows of skeletons of various ages. All the skeletons are dressed and at various stages of decay. Ten minutes here is more than enough time. Do not bring children.",
          "It's pretty obvious you will see a lot of dead people here, but to be clear, you will see A LOT OF DEAD PEOPLE. EVERYWHERE. It's fascinating, especially the clothes that the corpses are wearing, but I would not recommend this to anyone of a nervous disposition. The section with",
          "Decided to walk from our BB near the Marina not one off our best decisions.when we eventually found the catacombs we were surprised by its location and the surrounding area, run down best describes it. We found it interesting and macabre in a strange way. Some of the body's were",
          "Parking available outside. White lines mean there is no fee for parking but some toothless guy insisted we pay him 2 Euro for the parking. Didn\u2019t give us a ticket or anything, just took the money. It is both interesting and creepy to see how they have preserved the bodies.",
          "On a recommendation, we walked to the Catacombs. WARNING....This is NOT a place to bring kids. We were not expecting what we experienced. Bodies lining the walls that are in various states of decay. Most were bones but others still had leathery skin on their skulls/faces.",
          "It was about a 20 minute walk from the Norman Palace. It was a pretty direct route but there were very few signs posted to let you know you were on the right path, but I've found that to be pretty typical in Italy. Luckily there were plenty of friendly people willing to direct",
          "...unless you really like seeing dead bodies and skeletons. Three euro entry is fair considering the presentation of the people on display, although it is sad that these people are used as a tourist attraction. Only went as it was part of a tour we were on. It would benefit",
          "Went with my wife, 2 teenage sons, and parents in law. First 10 minutes were interesting, rest was just creepy. I left early with my younger son and mother in law who were both done after 5 minutes. OK to skip",
          "Didn\u2019t know what to expect but was very impressed with the whole experience. The cadavers are in seperate sections according to their status, profession, sex and age. You enter and descend into the Catacombs which are well presented if not a bit macabre.",
          "We visited the monastery and catacombs of capuchins and there are lots of dead people there. It\u2019s quite interesting if not creepy to see. Remember that in those days, people thought it was fashionable to be mummified and preserved for eternity in the clothing they chose. Some",
          "We visited this place today. It\u2019s a little out of the main town however we walked there. (Nothing else around to see nearby.) Only about 20 stairs down to the \u201c catacombs.\u201d Not as cool as I hoped. The skeletons are mostly vertical and dressed. I didn\u2019t like seeing their heads.",
          "Not for the faint of heart I suppose, but the sheer amount of bodies is amazing. The Capuchin monks realized they could profit from the crypt by selling slots, and thousands of people are interred here. The floors are glass, and so you feel like you may slide through - but it is",
          "We went there with 2 teenagers. We all found the place very unique and interesting. We did not have a guide but I will definitely recommend to read a little about it before visiting. We spent around 1 hour at the place and it is easy to park just outside. All photos and films",
          "This is a very eerie experience...it made us aware just how disensitized we as humans have become. Seeing the corpses you almost don't want to believe they are real. Some of the more preserved skeletons are very \"real\" looking and scary. The monk and the gentleman at front desk",
          "Honestly I couldn\u2019t believe how well preserved this was. There were many bodies and what I found interesting was the way that they were displayed. Very respectable place. Interesting way of preserving the deceased.",
          "Having read the reviews prior, it was more or less as expected and worth the \u20ac3. As others have said, the lack of information spoils it.",
          "The respectful displays of the many deads in various states of decay and mummifaction are a reminder of our own mortality. There is absolutely no show aspect to the catacombs; the Capuchins are just monks respecting and taking care of the dead, whether they are monks, civilians,",
          "Not for the faint-hearted. It\u2019s like you stepped on set for Tales from the Crypt. It\u2019s seriously creepy and you wouldn\u2019t want to get trapped in there for a power outage but well worth the visit in my eyes and at \u20ac3 pretty cheap too. There are hundreds of bodies/skeletons in",
          "It's a bit out of the way and up a hill so catch bus 124 and walk down. Jaw dropping stuff. Visit the graveyard next to it as well to see how Scilians take care of their loved ones graves",
          "We had seen this on Sicily Unpacked perhaps? my son (10) who is of a morbid dispostion was very keen to see the monks. We arrived at 3, after a short walk from the historic centre to find a long queue waiting to go in. The entrance was just a few Euro. One descends into the",
          "Forget the Egyptians. If you want to see mummies. This is the place. Extremely interesting. I was beside myself on the thought process of wanting your remains displayed like they were.",
          "Strangely beautiful and calming - A very unique experience, I expected to be unsettled, but found the visit strangely calming...the silence, the history, the close up view of those that have gone before....don't be put off, worth the visit!!",
          "We visited the Catacombe dei Cappuccino while in Palermo. It was pretty interesting although a bit macabre. the bodies are hung on the wall clothed and 'staring' at you.",
          "Do not miss this place. Maybe the only one in the world of this kind. Bodies were preserved using a different method. Some stay in very good condition. Amazing. Not the same feeling when you see it live than in a photo or video. You need a car to get there. Located away from",
          "A place for Day of the Dead Lovers, with real mummified skeletons on display -- not those artful ones you see in Mexico. This is a real tomb with real bodies. If Memento Mori is your passion, this is a must-see.",
          "Wandering the mummified remains makes one wonder about one's own mortality and is a thought provoking place to visit. Well worth it.",
          "It\u2019s something you won\u2019t see again and it was an experience to visit. You could touch almost them, you were that close at times. It is a walk of 1km after getting off the hop on hop off bus at stop 7 on the red line or you can drive and park out front if you wish. I wouldn\u2019t",
          "If you decide to visit the catacombs, I think you\u2019ll agree that this is one of the weirdest \u201ctourist sites\u201d you will have ever seen. It could be described as voyeuristic, if not lurid, but if you want to explore a huge underground vault with eight thousand mummified bodies from",
          "Got to be honest I didn\u2019t quite get this or see the point. Lots of skeletons on display in clothing. It\u2019s quite a walk outside of the main sites but doable if you\u2019ve got the will or the time. If your sight seeing I guess you have to go but it just didn\u2019t really inspire me. No",
          "Do a pre-read before visiting. We took a taxi to the place from our hotel (it seems taxi drivers in Palermo charge 20 euro to take you to a place or back). There was no crowd at the entrance and we visited with no hustle on a business day. It seemed there were parking places",
          "You can\u2019t witness something like they anywhere else in the world. The catacombs are huge with a crazy amount of mommies dating from 1599 to the 1900s. Some of them are incredibly well maintenez and it\u2019s a creepy yet amazing experience to visit it. It\u2019s my highlight in Palermo.",
          "We knew what we were getting into, but the scope of the place was incredible. It was vast. Hundreds upon hundreds of monks and others spending eternity. Dying and knowing you would be reunited with your brethren must give some comfort to the living, but that conviction is",
          "These catacombs started in the sixteenth century. Unfortunately no photographs allowed. Entrance fee is \u20ac3 per person, served by a monk. The place is full of skulls which are put onto straw bodies which are dressed in garments. Most skulls are in tact, some have a missing cheek",
          "It is morbid, but I have never see so many dead bodies! They are propped up alongside the walkways by their families in their best costumes for all to see. Simply amazing.",
          "We visited on a national holiday, so the area was buzzing. The catacombs were open with a small entrance fee. The inhabitants were in various states of decomposition and attire. The majority appeared to be from just after the unification of Italy. There is a balance between the",
          "We knew this was a left field choice, but we were still surprised by what we saw. Definitely not for the feint hearted or children. If you are into horror movies this may be up your street.",
          "Walk downstairs and you are immediately greeted but a long collection of corpses hanging on the walls. We found it interesting and certainly unique, more than other churches with similar collections. Would have benefitted from a small introduction to what this all meant and how",
          "It takes a couple of buses to get here but it is worth the effort. The catacombs are expansive with several hundred \"residents\" on display. Because this is a reverent sacred place, photos are not permitted although there always seem to be a few self entitled individuals who",
          "Admittedly I'm no expert on the catacombs of Europe, but in this place I felt uncomfortable, yet respectful. It was quiet when I was there, and that probably added to the atmosphere. There were many remains in various states of preservation. It's a place I will definitely",
          "No stories, no descriptions, nothing interesting. Literally rows of bones, bones and some straw in clothes. Meh.",
          "A fair walk out of the town and unfortunately just timed so they had closed. Visited the interesting cemetery attached with Ornate crypts housing families.",
          "We track down ossuaries and bone crypts across Europe (still have many to do!). These catacombs are amongst the best. So many mummies on display. No photos allowed (although that doesn't seem to stop loads ending up on Instagram). Well worth a visit if you're into the obscure,",
          "An odd and disturbing, yet strangely fascinating visit. Dozens of dead people, preserved by having their innards removed then washed in vinegar or arsenic, then dressed in their clothes and kept in the catacombs. Centuries of people in different forms of attire, the poor,",
          "Booked this tour through our cruise ship, imagining an underground crypt with coffins. We were shocked to find corpses hanging from the walls. Bit taken aback but found it moving and quite sad. Our 11 year old son was amazed by it. Not creepy or scary but truly a different tour",
          "You won\u2019t see anything like this place anywhere else! We thought we would be going in and seeing graves and crypts and when we went round the corridor we were shocked. It was so interesting and not what we expected! My dad was talking about it for days afterward! We got there 15",
          "This is quite a distance out of the old town compared to other tourist destinations, but is well worth the walk. Make sure you look at the opening times carefully so you don\u2019t arrive when it is shut. The entrance price is a bargain at \u20ac3. We were really pleased to find that the",
          "I did not enjoy the visit to this place, as the energy here was so negative. Obviously, it would be so with all the dead bodies around. This place is worth a visit to remind ourselves that we are just a bundle of bones who will leave this earth soon!! Rosalia looked fresh and",
          "About a quarter hour walk from the Norman Palace, this is a fascinating place. It is not very well signposted but we eventually managed to find it although you can dropped off there on the city bus tours. Set out in corridors of monks, professionals, women, children, etc there",
          "What can I say? Wall to wall mummies, in their burial dress, posed, categorized by \"virgins\", \"priests\" and whatnot. This is not your bandage covered Egyptian kind of mummy, I can tell you! I thought I had seen a lot ...and then I came here. I recommend it. You won't forget",
          "It is a creepy, but an interesting experience. You can see skeletons from 1840 up to 1940 and also the famous Rosalia, the well-preserved corpse of the little girl. It is better if you read about the place before, so you can understand more about the burials and mummification",
          "Macabre place, remote of the main city. These are not mummies but merely sceletons, dried out human remains with one side broken open coffins to make them visible. The more, be very vigilant for theft in that part of the city, do not walk around, better go by taxi instead of",
          "We wanted to visit the catacombs expecting to get more information about the place once on site. The lack of information about the remains subtracts from this unique experience. After returning to my hotel I read about the burials and mummification process. Knowing this before",
          "This was an interesting experience. There was a totally different energy than outside under the sun. It's amazing to see how preserved some of the mummies are. The only thing that bothered me was that quite a few visitors were taking pictures (with flash) even though there were",
          "The museum has the biggest selection of mummies in the world and you experience a different type of just a simple visit to a museum. The mummies are placed in a every single wall of the catacombs and are categorised according to the sex,age or social status. They wear their own",
          "It may sound macabre but my wife had wanted to see this for many years and she wasnt disappointed. Weird, wacky, sad, amazing all at the same time. The colours of the clothes on the corpses have faded but she would still highly recommend it. Get a taxi from the centre. If you",
          "Hard to review to be honest but I think it is one of them things that you want the experience of seeing but wouldn't be rushing back. Cheap entry. A very eerie experience but fascinating at the same time. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a bit squeamish or children.",
          "Visited today by myself since I could not get anyone to visit with me. It does not take a lot of time, so if you are short on time it is a good choice.",
          "I really wouldn\u2019t take children! This is the kind of place that would have given me nightmares as a kid. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for was not only how many corpses there are in the catacombs, but also the fact that most of them are stood up. Well, hung up, attached to the walls.",
          "Free parking right in front of this hidden gem, cheap and not crowded at all. Hundreds of mummified bodies. Too bad there\u2019s no English information, besides the sections they made (males, females, kids, babies and monks). No photo and video allowed.",
          "I don't know if I can recommend this place. It is gruesome, the stuff of nightmares and is just body after body in the final decayed skeleton. Occasional stretches of skin, teeth and hair. Clothed and stuffed with straw and it is so dusty. Children also in this state. It",
          "We had read about this place and decided to go. I didn't realise quite how many bodies there were. It was extremely strange, but at the same time incredibly fascinating. Some of the bodies were only bones, but some still had their teeth and amazingly some still had hair - not",
          "It is definitely worth to visit catacombs. We did not feel any disturbance or disgust - there are thousands of corpses in the condition of mummy or skeleton, these people have been dead since more than 100 years so no one expects to see dead bodies. It was weird trend to be",
          "Was not too sure that I wanted to see the Catacombs, but did want to see all that is relevant to the history of Palermo. We stopped off on the way back from Monreale. It is cheap to get in, and the queue soon goes down. We did not linger for long, and avoided the passage way",
          "A really unusual place to visit. Some would find it disturbing but if you\u2019re interested in memento mori it\u2019s worth a wander round. I found it fascinating.",
          "Feels a little morbid but fascinating none the less! Took a while to find as we got lost but was glad we visited.",
          "I can\u2019t agree with the reviews that say it is a \u201cmust see\u201d, my brother and I found it rather boring. Yes it\u2019s cheap to get in but after you\u2019ve seen 1 mummified body you\u2019ve seen them all and with no English translations, the historical facts were lost on us.",
          "The condition of the remains in the catacombs is dreadful, the entire experience is macabre and feels very disrespectful.",
          "Today we visited the catacombes with some thousands of mummified bodies displayed around multiple corridors dating from about 1700s to 1920s. It was an interesting if slightly weird experience. What was of interest to my wife was the beautiful lace that some of the corpses were",
          "An interesting place to visit, but not easy to get your head round at all, knowing these are just shells of the people they had once been and especially sad to see so many children. A quiet thoughtful time afterwards is essential to consider what you have seen, it\u2019s not",
          "A place where you really feel the memento mori. At the same time you are aware of your mortality and your life. It's not a place for everybody, so skip it if you're not sure.",
          "Our cruise ship was rerouted from Malta to Palermo due to bad weather so at the last minute we decided to go to the Catacombs of Palermo.The sight of 8000 skeleons and skulls in their original finery is not everyones cup of tea but it is a fascinating one hour experience and",
          "I thought it was going to be just a few dry bones and some skulls. But this was jaw-droppingly macabre. The bodies are in coffins, standing upright, in niches and literally hanging from the wall. All in various stages of mummification and all dressed in their Sunday best, which",
          "I had looked forward to visiting the catacombs and from arriving i was disappointed that there was no change in temperature and no earthiness which can be found in other catacombs i have visited. Even though i knew what to expect i am unsure if this is little more than a tourist",
          "My wife and I walked to the Crypt. Only 3 euro entrance fee. It was well worth it. We saw bodies in there from 1599. They have the bodies arranged from men, women, children, professional...etc. Some of these people still have skin, hair, beards, and eyebrows. Worth the trip to",
          "Interesting to read all the varied reviews on the Cappuchins. It's not going to suit everybody but it's well worth experiencing this unique place. Yes it's strange. Anything to do with death is uncomfortable. Especially being able to view it as it is presented to us here. This",
          "Certainly this place is unique but it is really rather grim. As so many people have remarked these were real people and I am amazed that there are visitors with small children here. I have been here twice, first time as it was said to be a Must See and the second time travelling",
          "It says its a must see in palermo but unsure if we made the right desision to go what you must realise is these are people not mumies and youre in very close proximety to them although faconating as they are in the actual clothes from that time i personally felt as though we",
          "Visited for second time the catacombes, but still scarry those skulls and all kind of bones. I think that this place is unique and you have to visit it.",
          "The view of thousands of skeletons is quite scarying and is not for everyone. The location is quite outside the city center. I got the negative impression that although it was not allowed to make photos inside ( because it is not appropriate to make photos of deceased people)",
          "Visited here on an excursion to Monreale and Palermo. I was rather taken aback when we first went in, mainly by the sheer size of the catacombs and number of bodies. It was fascinating ,in a macabre sort of way, to see them wearing clothes which reflected their professions etc.",
          "Everyone says to visit and half the party thought it worthwhile half disliked it. Yes its a set of mummies and they aren't Egyptian - not vampire material Do check the opening times at the lunch period as there is very little shade to wait/queue for ticket office. If timing is",

          "To be honest I was pretty disappointed - it is a kind of cript (catacombe is a little too much to title) with a lot of skeletons dressed. From ethnographic and historical fashion point of view might be interesting, otherwise is a kind of memento mori - the proof that after",
          "We visited the catacomb but it is not for the faint hearted It was weird and a once off experience for me I did not understand the language but i recommend you get a tour guide to assist if this is on your bucket lust",
          "Guess I'm biased as this was the whole reason to visit Palermo. Did not disappoint, so incredibly interesting. Get there early to wander round in wonder and respectfully before the hordes of buses arrive. It's open for 3 hours morning and afternoon. Sit in one of the free",
          "But well worth the experience. The place is extremely creepy, looking at mummified bodies, that have mostly been so well preserved, is quite unnerving. Some are in better condition than others. Most are noted and some history is given, more would have been good. I guess they",
          "You can take your time and see everything in 45 minutes. Preety cool in a dark tourism way. It's a bit outside the historical area. Could have done with more information on why, when and who. I think they were more interested in selling their guide. Note the times are 9:00-1:00",
          "I've seen mummies before. but this museum is a very different experience. Believe me, you want to look at the mummies one by one. Very interesting. babies, women, guys... No photography allowed. Visitors were taking a secret photo. Some of them have eyelashes, eyebrows or even",

          "This site is just a few euro to enter, and it is well preserved and managed. Expect to see literally hundreds of full skeletons in era dress. There is also a section of deceased children fully dressed in their age appropriate garb. We did not stay long here, as it was not our",

          "This is an amazing display of corpses, most incredibly well preserved. A must see for us although others many wonder. It is important not to consider walking here, as we did. This is not a good idea as suddenly big roads with many people around turn into very run down areas",
          "Really peculiar place. Only 3\u20ac, and you walk around it in about 30 minutes. What I found interesting was the clothes on the mummies. Really gave an indication of the time period these people lived in. Eventually had to escape though for fresh air. The cemetery next door is",

          "Very cheap to go in (\u20ac3) and just an odd place. Apparently you are not allowed to take photos but I saw several people doing it. I hope so don\u2019t have weird dreams later tonight. Worth checking out - will take around 30-40 min to go through. There is no info provided at entry.",

          "If your into looking at dead people hanging around your cellar this is the place to visit, in all honesty it is very interesting and a must if in the area.. I wouldn\u2019t suggest taking kids as nightmares may follow.",
          "Interesting to see, but not as moving or indeed as macabre as I might have imagined. Too much a tourist attraction and too far removed from the Cappucin community to have the meaning it is meant to possess.",
          "I have to admit seeing all of those skeletons was a bit intense. Our guide Alan had a lot of knowledge on the subject. However it was a bit difficult to understand him at times because of his heavy accent and his tone was low. However the other guide Sean was clear and also",

          "Some will like it some not. 8000 dead people can make impression if you accept it. The little, 2 y.o. girl embalmed 100 years ago can be considered spectacular. Decide yourself if you like such attractions. No photo inside.",
          "This place exceeded all my expectations and even my bf who wasn't convinced to go and look for it with me, was happy to experience it in the end. Strangely it is and it is not scary. But it truly is a fascinating place. It may seem creepy, but you learn a lot and it makes you",
          "I don't doubt for a second that the costume and set designers of the Indiana Jones movies must have visited here for both inspiration and research. To learn that the Capuchin Monks began placing the members of their order here in 1599, at a time when bodies of the holy were",

          "The bodies are described as mummified, but in reality, the majority are only bones. I found how these corpses have been turned into a tourist attraction disrespectful and a little disturbing. I wondered if these people would still want to be here if they could see what it has",
          "Some would say that I should expect to see open mummies on a public display if I choose to go and see the Catacombs. That is the purpose of the visit of this place, after all. However it seemed to be for me too much packed with amazingly big amount of mummies on the small",

          "The catacombs was a very special experience. Seeing all the dead people, familyes and even premature born children was spectacular. The best kept body, Rosalita who died only two years old and who still are in good condition was magic. Recommended place to visit when in",
          "First time into a catacomb of any sort. Yeah, full of dead bodies, organised in sections too. Little English explanations so just a show of corpses in dress. The entrance to the place is rather non-descript; looks like a odds-and-ends stall as it is located next to a souvenir",

          "Worth the twenty-minute walk out of the city centre to visit this unique experience. It's just 3\u20ac to visit and spend forty minutes exploring the history of the city through the people that used to live there.",
          "Having seen many catacombs I have never seen one like this. The bodies are on display in their burial clothes & most are very well preserved. The clothing is interesting to see from a social history point of view. There are children as well as adults, but they are all shown in a",
          "A short drive by taxi from Palermo's City Centre, the Catacombs of the Cappuccino monks , is worth an hour of your time. We had seen most other attractions in Palermo so going here was \"icing on the cake\". Seeing this vast underground cemetery is a unique, macabre attraction.",
          "I found this visit to be very interesting and quite different from what I\u2019ve seen in my travels, but lacked in providing information; there\u2019s very little signage and what exists is in Italian only. Do your research beforehand in order to get more out of your visit, but do go as",
          "Both interesting and a little creepy. Not sure how valid many of these are, as there is no audio tour nor any information in the catacombs to explain. Essentially, it\u2019s just \u201chere\u2019s a bunch of skeletons, enjoy\u201d kind of thing. I wish I knew more about many of the halls, but I can",
          "Nowhere else will you experience a spine chilling \u2018touch\u2019 of those who passed away a long time ago. We went there with young children, which gave us chance to discuss the less mortal aspects of life. Having said that, I still believe isn\u2019t a place for the faint-hearted.",
          "Interesting in a historical point of view but not suitable for small children as I found it a bit full on skeleton after skeleton all dressed and very ghoulish ! Just wantedto get out .",
          "The catacombes are completely opened and, weird detail, the body are pretty much all hung on the wall. Impressive to see the natural mummification process and the details that those mummies give us about the past. Not for sensitive people though!! One thing: if you visit, please",
          "We took 2 buses to get there from the train station and paid a very reasonable \u20ac3 entrance each. No photogralhy or videography allowed as a mark of respect to the dead. A haunting and memorable experience. The natural mumification process was fascinating to read about on their",
          "Not a place to visit for the faint hearted or any one who might suffer from claustrophobia... but I would not hv missed it for the world. It is anazing to be able to walk around and let your imagination take you back into the lives of so many different eras . Keep in mind this",
          "Although I am sure a certain type of visitor may find this dreadful place interesting, it certainly wasn\u2019t for me .. I find places like this quite sad and a bit, well.. gruesome !! With so many wonderful things to see and visit in Palermo , simply don\u2019t understand why anyone",
          "Do not miss this catacombs if you are in Palermo. Everywhere skulls bones. Nice experience you will see how you will be look like 200 years later.",
          "If you are visiting Palermo, one of the things that can be done in this city is visiting Catacombe dei Cappuccini. It is a strange place, has about 8000 mummies. I recommend you to read about this place before entering.",
          "I would not say I am particularly ghoulish but this was interesting and slightly disturbing at the same time. There are rows of corpses some hung some laid out all in full dress of the period. The corpses are preserved in the caves following the Cappuccini traditions which",
          "I can't say that it was a top priority for me, but my travel pal, my cousin really wanted to go, so we walked over to see the famous Catacombe dei Cappuccini.. It's only 3 euros. The best buy was the 10 euro book on Sicily's art & history that was sold at the entrance.. Some",
          "We chose a guided tour through Sicilandays.com. Our guide, Patrizia picked us up, took us to the catacombs giving us detailed information of the why, the how and the when of the history of the catacombs. A weird insight into ancient beliefs and a less than respectful way to be",
          "Not as big as I thought it would be but very interesting and for 3 euros entrance fee really good value loved it",
          "Interesting place to visit. Not to expensive to get in only \u20ac3. Pretty amazing to see it all. Wouldn't recommending taking children there unless they are a bit more mature or able to show respect and be controlled. A shame about the people who disrespect things and take photo's",
          "Hundreds of mummies and human skeletons on display. Read about the place before u visit. It is quite a walk from the centre of town. Three euro entry. Worth a visit",
          "Wow... what an unusual thing. Mummified corpses dating back to the late 1500s to the late 1800s some are amazingly well preserved. Not sure I would take a sensitive child there but i found it really interesting.",
          "It is macabre and scary, but it is also most fascinating to view where the old religious and societal practices lead at some stage, and how relative our beliefs are. Then it was desired, now seems a disrespect, but there we are: the collection of the dead in their best attire,",
          "Strange creepy place. We were two couples and our friends liked the place very much, but for me and my husband it was too creepy with all the corpse hanging from the walls. Anyway it great place to start exploring Palermo if you are with car. The parking in front is free (not",

          "We looked at some of the tours offered then just googled it to learn as much as we wanted/needed to know and then just paid the 3 Euro/person entrance fee and went through. Frankly, a tour would have kept us down there longer than we needed to stay. It\u2019s very macabre and",
          "A creepy place completely abandoned to itself! No explanations, no flyers or guide able to let you understand why the place exists and its history! Ah, of course you can\u2019t take any pictures but you can buy their posta cards set! The frati must be very proud of how they got",
          "Probably 20 minutes is about enough. There are only so many dead bodies and mummified corpses I\u2019d need to see before it all becomes a blur. About \u20ac3 entrance fee.",
          "Strange place to visit. Lots of dressed skeletons standing up and staring back at you. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "If you like the macabre, you'll like this place. It's got fully dressed skeletons that are standing up. It's a short visit.",
          "This is a great catacombs to visit. It is amazing how well the bodies are preserved, right down to hair and skin still being on them. It is a wonderful walk through history to look at the clothes of the time, the burial techniques. I would caution anyone from bringing small",

          "I still do not understand why all these \"mummies\" are kept in this place. Can be horrifying for children.",
          "interesting to discover how some bodies are be preserved but after half hour it's really enough. Good for scientists.",
          "An unforgettable experience. Macabre to some and moving for others. The catacombs are easily walkable (although mostly uphill) from central Palermo although in places the curbs are narrow and so you have to watch for passing traffic. They ask that you don\u2019t take photographs",
          "It was an eerie feeling walking through. The tour was very informative and interesting. I know my wife and I had a strange feeling as we walked through. I would highly recommend making sure you are okay with seeing human remains displayed. It is very interesting but seeing this",
          "Poorly signposted so hard to find even on foot. Entire experience is something that has seen far better days and has not been maintained in spite of significant amounts of money being poured into it some years ago. Not worth the entrance fee.",
          "It\u2019s hard to sum up really! It\u2019s interesting, but a bit uncomfortably so, not much information on offer, it\u2019s really just a lot of bodies hanging from the walls & piled up.. and I mean lots of them (it\u2019s bigger than you might anticipate). As it is, it just feels like a macabre",
          "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so confronted with my own mortality. Its actually hard to digest that your really viewing long dead people at various stages of decomposition. I was mesmerised, fascinated and uncomfortable all at the same time. It was hard to believe this wasn\u2019t",
          "Very uncommon attraction, hard to find something similiar somewhere else. Taking photos is forbidden but it is obvious in that kind of place.",
          "\u20ac3 to walk around underground catacombs to look at 8000 bodies, strung up against the walls in various forms of decomposition. Very strange. You can get quite close to the bodies, just a railing between. Interesting to see how well preserved the clothes are. Not sure what",
          "far from the city center and not too much to see, just burial place, not a lot of archaeological stricture or historical info. not recommended as tourist attraction",
          "It doesn't look like much from the outside , as you start your descent into a subbasement ,with plenty of natural light it gets eerie seeing all of the skeletons lined up against the walls , some have been preserved quite well and most are with their original clothing mostly",
          "It took as a while to find it walking as I trusted my google map and after many wrong turns we found the place much easier to go up the straight road past the Palace. When we went down to the Cattacombs I nearly turned back at the sight of so many dead bodies but after the long",
          "What to expect at Catacombs. Ok. I\u2019ll admit it. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this place before. And I loved it. BUT BE WARNED. There is no point in glossing over it. It\u2019s a giant crypt. Skeletons hang from the walls. Skeletons lie in coffins. Men. Women. Children.",
          "Just kidding! It is not what you expect at first. It takes a few seconds to understand that you are actually in the right place. Don't take a tour. Go on your own or get a bus and take a five minute walk. People are friendly and helpful. Do not waste your money on a taxi. The",

          "The catacombs are about 20-30 minutes walk from Palermo Port, but the location definitely worth the effort. The location is definitely something else and they way the visit went was just as this kind of location should be. A place where you need to act with respect and",
          "I actually had no idea what these Catacombes were when my tour group was brought here. Once upon a time, people of means paid serious money to be drained of liquids, stuffed with straw, then dressed up to be hung on hooks on these walls so their families could visit them. As",
          "I loved the place, the atmosphere and its history. It is also fascinating to see how the people wanted to be dressed in death.",
          "I guess some people like it, I don't. Too walk down in the catacombes to look at dead people isn't anything for me. I paid the entrance fee, walked in, but turned after 50 meters and left.",
          "I have been to different catacombs and this one was different in that all the skeletons were dressed. I went with my 9 yo daughter and it was not too creepy for her.",
          "You cannot take pictures here, but the people that have been preserved, some over 200 years ago, is astonishing. We just walked through it with our mouths open.",
          "The catacombs are a fascinating view of the departed placed fully clothed on racks against the walls of this large subterranean burial chamber. The bodies are dried and mummified over time. Priests, monks, professionals and even children haunt the halls here all in evolving",
          "Having seen the catacombs and crypts in Rome and Paris this was high on my to do list for Sicily. The admission price is so low only 3 Euros and the location is far from the bustling other tourist attractions. This was a once in a lifetime experience, there are so many bodies",
          "My wife had some reservations about visiting the catacombs, but we were both fascinated by this unique if somewhat strange site. Not at all 'spooky' as you might imagine, but quite moving to see how human remains have been 'stored' and looked after.",
          "The order of Capuchin Friars dates back to the 1500\u2019s and this abbey was dedicated to their usage. Whilst the abbey itself is not a fantastic building, the catacombs are the true marvel and are not like any other attraction in Europe. Here you will travel underground into the",
          "This was quite an adventure to get to....however it was worth it. It is the marked like a tourist attraction, but it was awesome. Some of the skeletons even had hair. It was freaky...but so interesting to read about the origins or see the dressing of those buried. Not to be",
          "Very macabre and unique. I actually found the clothes the corpses were wearing to be interesting. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it for children or people who get grossed out easily.",
          "Be respectful when you come here, first of all. It's a little creepy to see dressed skeletons hanging off the walls, but interesting still. It's sad the state of decay they are in with limbs missing and such. Especially sad are the children who died so young and obviously were",
          "More hundreds of mummified bodies can be seen here from all age. Very unique sanctuary place where only rich persons were buried.",
          "I have rated this as very good because it is so extraordinary and really rather creepy. Having visited catacombs in Rome and now in Palermo I feel that I have seen enough!",
          "A very unique experience. I am not aware of any other catacombs that have been used up until the mid 20thC, and the fact that all the bodies are in original clothing is all the more fascinating. For just 3 Euros entrance fee this is a very worthwhile visit.",
          "It\u2019s not everyday you stroll into a place like this for 3Eur. Spent about 20 mins walking around. Fascinating but very plain. It would have been nice to have some more info during the visit (no signs actually explaining what you are seeing).",
          "Something between a museum and a slightly nightmarish dream. The rows of dead people stare at you from the walls, room after room. You wonder what it would be like to visit the place at night, with a candle in your hand...",
          "What can one say This place is unique I still don\u2019t know what to make of it I didn\u2019t like it, but I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the point This is a different cultures way of dealing with the dead Amazing",
          "The place is generally interesting to see, but I would love to receive any historical background about this place, some information about people buried here. The way it is now makes the place feel very non-personal, things you see don't stay in your mind. It is simply like",
          "It was a special place for my Palermo Trip. I never saw something similar. Of course, we speak about a macabre attraction, but this mix of feelings could have once on a lifetime. Many bodies is in a good condition and for some of them the preservation were spectacular. We could",
          "These catacombs are fascinating and well worth a vist. The bodies are mainly monks And later they mummified locals. The locals would come dress them and pray for their souls.",
          "This is a reasonably popular attraction adjacent to a busy cemetery. It is a bizarre catacomb where the residents are fixed to the walls in a standing position. Rosalia Lombardo, the little two year old interred here in a glass case is often visited. This place can be",

          "This Is well worth a visit. It isn't for the faint hearted and I'm unsure if it. Is suitable for small children. It's only 3 euro entry. Little bit of a walk to pop into google maps and you will be there in no time . We spent about 15 min there.",
          "I visited here out of curiosity after seeing something on TV about it a while ago. It was rather scary and seemed like the dead were observing you but also interesting to see the clothing from the past. There was a section for children and also for virgins. Some of the",
          "I\u2019ve never seen such a place before! It\u2019s kind of scary but interesting at the same time. You should go there, if you have enough time. Entrance is not that expensive - 5\u20ac I guess",
          "Went to this after seeing on British TV, it was October 31 (the day of the dead / All Hallows Eve) st which added to the atmosphere. It is spooky and interesting in equal measure seeing the dead peer down on you or at your hight. The ded are organised into themes by profession",
          "If you have never been to catacombs this will leave you speechless. The mummified bodies of hundreds of Sicilians hang along the walls of the cave corridors, leaving you feeling very humbled by the history and ceased life surrounding you. They have organized the bodies by",
          "Many cultures have prepared and preserved the bodies of their loved ones. Sicily is no exception and this particular set of catacombs is well worth the visit. We have visited catacombs in Peru as well and these are equally memorable. Somehow we missed the most famous",
          "An early morning start meant that we were at the catacombs before the full lighting was switched on! Very spooky, very interesting with hundreds of dead bodies.No make that 8,000 dead bodies Within a short space of time the remains became well lit . Arranged in categories",
          "This site is ok for most people. However i did see one weeping lady looking at the preserved child who is now better protected under glass.The most interesting aspect is the costumes of the period (unless your a dentist!). There is easy access and natural light from the windows",
          "The catacombes in Palermo is wild. I have never been so freaked out. Being a walking dead fan, this place will really give you the jitters. It's amazing to see all the dead people hanging either from the walls or laying down. You can still see the skin on some of the",
          "I was very excited to see this place, I found it here on TripAdvisor and I was looking forward to it as it\u2019s something extraordinary and rare. I was surprised, there were much more dead bodies than I expected and closer than I thought. Even though you are not allowed to touch it",
          "This ranks high on the sites to see in Palermo, quite odd and probably unique in the world. if you are scarred then don't go as an aerie feeling - however we all end up this way but not necessarily on view",
          "Go early, we went for opening time and had the catacombs to ourselves which made it especially eerie and poignant. Its a weird, weird place. A must for anyone interesting in different histories and social cultures. We walked round twice to take it all in and believe our eyes...",
          "This is one of those places that it is fun to see, but also is a little poignant. The catacombs are filled with skeletons, shrouded and clothed- a bit like scarecrows. They grin down and out on you from there shelves, hands crossed, heads turned- slightly disheveled from being",
          "The catacombs are among the highlights in Palermo, make sure not to miss it. Make sure also to read a little bit in before hand as you won't get any explanatory information once inside. The stage of preservation of some of the mummies is quite stunning and yes, after a while it",
          "a 20 minute walk from Quatro Canti and you find yourself in a residential district housing the catacombs. You pay at the desk and descend down into what is more like a crypt with daylight from windows at ceiling height. The catacombs are smaller than expected but how many",
          "Other cultivated visitors expressed already concerns and I would echo some. Interior ist not really protected against light, dust, dirt, flashlights and touchy fingers. I wonder why no aircondition is preventing the atmosphere to destroy the fascinating relicts. Double the entry",
          "Remarkable site, outside of downtown Palermo. We visited multiple catacombs in Sicily, but this is the only one with the residents still present. A unique place to visit.",
          "Well signed as a little way outside the city centre but easily walkable It was a shame that there was no information leaflet before going in. We checked out Wikipedia after viewing and the info was very interesting On entry the sight is quite shocking and quite creepy. It",
          "We visited the Catacombs in Palermo. Amazing how some of the bodies remain intact. Lots of history, and great souvenirs available after you finish viewing the Catacombs, I recommend to visit.",
          "Great to see one of many catacombs. Human remains moved. Not for the clostrephobic tho underground in darkened alleys or should I say tombs",
          "went here on a whim. This is a museum which was originally the burial place of Capuchin monks and then over time expanded to include local people from Palermo. Skeletons of me, women and children all dressed up. After a while it gets boring. If you like the macabre go, if not",
          "We went to visit the catacombs because we\u2019d read about them, but being down there is a whole different story. The atmosphere with hundreds of dead bodies surrounding you takes you to a weird place. I really enjoyed the visit, and Rosalia is just incredible. You have to see this.",
          "This is a very strange place to visit. Its quite creepy but it was a unique experiance. It takes around half an hour to walk around, longer if you stop to look 'people' in detail. It gives you an idea of how people wanted to be remembered in thier clothing, which is a",
          "Extremely fascinating, however this is not for everyone as some of the \"items\" on display can be a little disturbing or even creepy. Not for persons who are susceptible to bad dreams.",
          "Not for the faint-hearted, but a very interesting experience. You can secretly snatch a photo or two.",
          "The site does not have any explanatory signs which is a shame but it is still worth a visit especially as you can read up on it prior to visiting. 30 mins is more than enough to roam around - pictures aren't allowed",
          "The place is what it is, do not venture in if you are quesy about certain things. I enjoyed going around the place respectfully, the only thing that marred my visit were a couple of tourists who were treating it more like a freak show. More attendants should be available in",
          "Why do we as a species like to look at our own dead? I thought about that long and hard as we spent 40 minutes or so wandering around this creepy but compelling place. Perfect for teenagers to help them take on board some facts of life (death), and fascinating in the way it is",
          "If you're in Palermo don't miss the opportunity to visit the catacombs. Not for everyone I know but I was enthralled.",
          "It was a quite exciting visit at Palermo Capuchins Catacombs. Not for everyone and don't go there if you are very sensitive. Long lines of preserved bodies from last few centuries. It's difficult to say that it is amazing but truly the numbers and the fact that there are bodies",
          "3 euro in. It they don't really check tickets so u could sneak in About 2 km from centre Very good ounce you are not afraid of lots of dead bodies Very well done No photos allowed but you can sneak a few but cameras everywhere",
          "Definitely worth the visit - a different experience to see the mummies lining the wall and so close. It was a hot day when we went and even though it was under ground it was still hot so take a portable fan with you if you have one! This is one of those places that you will",
          "This is a place where the living meets the dead, with over 8000 bodies mummified and displayed. It is an unnerving experience to walk among them. The saddest part is looking at the children and babies who have died, especially the remains of Rosalia Lombardo who looks as if she",
          "Many catacombs have only the slots cut in the stone where the corpses once rested but this one is very different. Basically they are halls of hanging corpses - fastened by the neck to pegs on the walls. The skeletons are dressed as they were when they were brought to this",
          "These are one of those places that you either love or hate. It's clearly filled with hundreds of bodies dressed in their clothes. Some even have mummified skin so you can get a better idea of what the corpse would have looked like in life. Most distressing is seeing the small",
          "Well if you need a reminder of your own mortality this is the place to go!!!Loved the segregation...important people, children, doctors, virgins, yip they are all here!",
          "Place in Palermo You must visit. Hundrets of corpses / skeletons makes You feel strange and thrilled. Especially mumies of children and infants. Some of them so well preserved... We were seriously moved after the visit. Don't miss it!",
          "A must see if you are visiting Palermo, not for everyone though...very interesting and something you won't see often.",
          "This was a strange place but awesome ! 8000 dressed up corpses but not scary . \u20ac3 to get in......closed between 1pm and 3pm Go, it's worth it",
          "Well what can one say but simply the most creepy but interesting place we have ever visited. As ex-Archaeologists and a CSI this unique collection of mummies transcends everything. From a monk of 1599 to a two year old child. These mummies have eyes, hair and amazing preserved",
          "Morbid. Amazing to see the catacombs, it's worth a visit just for the novel experience. Very morbid though, some of the corpses still have intact faces. The main 'attraction' is the intact body of a dead baby. Pretty creepy. Historically the bodies range from the late 16th",
          "Very particular location, with hundreds of skeletons and mummified bodies. The \"sleeping girl\" is quite particular",
          "Super interesting and shocking . First of all, it's at least a 15-30 minute walk from the city center through not such a nice area. However , the place itself is well worth a visit, to see something completely different from what we are used to. I was quite disturbed after, but",
          "As you walk into the catacombes you are immediately come face to face with hundreds of mummified corpses. In some of them you can make out the facial features whereas on some there is quite a bit of decay. One section is full of small children and babies which I found quite",
          "We took the tour bus in Palermo and you get off at no 7 stop I think and it is about a 15 min walk, it does close at lunchtime so just be careful and check the opening times before you go it costs 3 euro each to get in. Interesting to see, worth visiting.",
          "If you like the macabre it is well worth the visit but if you are a sensitive person don't go. It is a huge \"collection\" of the dead lining the corridors mostly dressed in their Sunday finery. The last resident Rosalia looks like a doll. Very weird, difficult to compare to",
          "I've been to catacombs before but this was a real wow. It's worth the visit just to see the unusual way they hung the dead, and the beautiful little girl. We had a guide so it added tremendously to what we were viewing.",
          "We loved it here! take a taxi as it's about an hours walk out of the town centre, it's a fascinating experience and reasonable to get in! Well worth a visit",
          "... very strong impact and way how to meet with another attitude to death... Good to visit on the way to cathedral... Then to relax on the cathedral roof..",
          "Definitely worth the 3 EUR entrance fee, but it would have been nice with some more information down in the catacombes. You had to pay 4 EUR for the guidebook, which didn't really seem worth it. Still, I'd recommend going there, it was interesting even without the additional",
          "The short tour through the corpse filled Catacombs is an horrible experience, in a somewhat good way. This is certainly something that I will never forget. The entrance fee is reasonable but to get information you have to buy a small booklet of 4\u20ac. Certainly not for children,",
          "I dont understand why anybody should like it to be shown like that after death. The categories are strange, like presenting virgins and to show little kids bodies like that, is more than without any Moral. I am sorry i dont understand this kind of religion.",
          "This is such a contrast to any other tourist attraction you will visit anywhere else in the world. The catacombs are an amazing view into a tradition observed since the 1700s and as recently as the 1920s. The fact that the Monks have given people the opportunity to look into",
          "It is truely a unique experience but after the first few corpses includng the babies - well they are more or less the same. Not sure about how ethical it is to make money from those who have died. a bit of excitment wondering if some bits are going to break off and fall on",
          "I've never seen anything quite like this. Definitely worth a visit. Only 3\u20ac, won't take more than 15-20 minutes to browse, the cemetery and church were also nice. A bit outside of town, the walk from the north gate was 15 minutes of sweating, but worth it.",
          "Unfortunately we came to the Catacombs 5 min before they were closing, but we went down anyway and luckily the guy at the entrance let us stay for 10 min. It was a very different experience, and I don't know if it was because we were in such a hurry that we didn't see any info",
          "We went to the catacombs circa 14.00. Walking through it takes roughly 10-15 minutes. But what a great time. It was a slightly scary experience in which I contemplated the lives of the mummies (which have been there since from 100 years to over 400 years. It is not for people",
          "Interesting experience and quite shocking tbh but not much info on the general idea of the existance of the tombs. Just opened coffins and mummies everywhere :)",
          "Visiting the Catacombs was a really special experience. Several corridors filled with mummies and skeletons placed all over the walls. Most of them are wearing clothes, some of them have skin, hair and even facial expressions. There are different \"collections\" like Women, Men,",
          "Found this on a website of top things to do in Palermo so went along. Very interesting somber and different place to visit. Makes you think of your own mortality and not for everyone I would think and not for young children. One feels that you need to be reverend and quiet on a",
          "Well worth 3euro. Not my thing at all my Mrs made me go. Glad I did .Go on boys have some man the fxxk up",
          "This was one of the craziest absolutely most interesting places I've ever visited in all my travels. Dead bodies hanging on the wall, I mean skeletons, dressed up in their best outfits and in rows, divided by gender, age, and profession. Skulls lined up on the wall like jars of",
          "Interesting spot to see. You get to see a bit of history. Closed mid-day and we didn't know so we waited outside for a while.",
          "I have been to quite a few bone chapels in Europe, but this is truly a unique experience. Here you will see all levels of Palermatino citizenry, mummified, left as bones in their final state...to include the wardrobe. It is truly hard to describe. It may not be for everyone,",
          "Definetly a must see, however there was no information in english. Its in a weird neighbourhood we went there by car and paid for parking. You also pay for enterance like 3 euros.",
          "Incredible to visit, very confronting. Do not recommend for children at all. Avoid walking here as the road is very narrow and busy.",
          "This experience is creepy but interesting as you get taken back into a different time, when beliefs about death and burial were more diverse and give us perspective on life back then and the history of the city . One needs to read about this before you go however as there's",
          "A bit bizarre Place to og, but the curiosity caught up With us. Be aware of People that will watch Your car for Money if you park in the area. Its free parking so no need for that. We chose to move tha car further away, not possible to know what that People will do. Hence not a",
          "We visited the Catacombs taking turns as we were with a young kid who was sleeping when we got there. I don't know which adjectives I should use to describe this place..interesting, creepy, it gives a lot to think about... The ticket costs 3\u20ac and getting there requires a good",
          "I wasn't sure about this but knew that my other half wanted to see it. We visited in May. I thought it was really worth seeing and would recommend.",
          "The Capuchin Friars were very keen on death and keeping bodies of the dead on show. There is an egregious example in Rome but this is the larger example. Underground corridors and chambers are lined by real dead bodies, about eight thousand, dating from 17th to 19th Centuries.",
          "For horror-movies fans only. It's nothing more than a maze of corridors filled with skeletons: gave me the creeps, in addition it is in a remote location, and walking there is passing through sketchy streets...",
          "It was the first time in my life I have been in catacombs, and what I can say -It's really worth to visit, for sure if you are not afraid to see dead bodies. Maybe the most strange thing and uncommon is little balsamied girl under the glass, where she seems like a doll. You pay",
          "Definitely worth a visit simply for the fact that it's different from any other catacombs I've been to. It's not creepy or too dark and it's actually quite an interesting look into Sicilian culture. The road out to it from central Palermo is simple to find and follow but you'll",
          "A rather haunting experience, but I'd do it again. The entry is only \u20ac3 and the size of the collection is very impressive. Surely a thing to remember and reflect upon.",
          "This place is really impressive. When I planned my trip to Palermo, it was my primary place of interest. The entree fee is 3\u20ac, photo and video is prohibited but it worths visiting",
          "We visited here following a recommendation and while I'm glad we did visit the catacombs, it certainly was an experience. It's not the sort of place you could spend hours as it's incredibly eerie - particularly, the wonderfully-preserved child encased towards the end of the",
          "One of the most wierd bizarre but totally engrossing sights in the whole of Italy. Not for the faint hearted - but you will not forget this easily. A bit out of the way but well worth the journey.",
          "Thousands of bodies in various states of preservation--monks, priests, men, women, children--on shelves, in open coffins, hanging on hooks. Don't try to take pictures. They really mean it when they tell you not to.",
          "Many designs formed by using different bones of the human body. Monks from this order buried after death for fifteen years then dug up and bones used in display.",
          "This is quite unbelievable. You are literally looking at the remains of ancient people. Fascinating, a bit creepy, unique. Photos and videos are not allowed and there are cameras so if you disrespect the dead and try to photograph them \"Big Brother\" will ask you to stop over",
          "There is no photography allowed here so be sure to take it all in. This catacomb was located next to a church and a graveyard site. There were a few stairs that you had to go up and down in order to get to the catacombs. Our tour guide explained how and why these bodies",
          "This is an very very very strange attraction. I have never seen something like this. It's kind of weird ans unnerving. Just go and have look.",
          "This is a commercial undertaking: lots and lots of dead bodies but not authentic. Corpses more than 150 years dead with still some pretty good clothes on: as I said \"weird\". Nevertheless, if you have the time, go visit and be amazed. Think \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson and",
          "I have visited the Capuchin crypts in rome, but they are nothing compared to this! The history alone is so interesting and it's hard to imagine that all these corpses were once living human beings. It's somewhat macabre, but fascinating at the same time. The clothes worn by the",
          "This place is creepy but definitely worth to visit! You have to walk a bit to get there but its a good place to visit something you may have ever seen before. There is also a nice graveyard to have a little walk in shadow if its a hot day.",
          "This place is kinda creepy and if you're into that horror stuff you'll love it. Skeletons surround you and no picture taking allowed, but not too sure anyone would want to take photos of the skeletons.. You'll find the most beautiful mummy here, she looks like she is just",
          "My husband did not enjoy this at all. He could not see what anyone would want to see mummified corpses. It was a very unusual site to see so many mummified bodies in one place, all dressed in clothes that they had worn in life. After a while there are just too many... and it is",
          "It was quite interesting and the ticket is cheap. Only 3 Euros/person. The bodies are well preserved and presented upon different galleries, but with no explantion relying to how old they are or what their story is. This can be improved.",
          "A somewhat macabre experience viewing 8000 preserved bodies including a perfectly preserved 3-year old child. The bodies were all catalogued and gave an insight into 19th century dress.",
          "This is a must see! Over 8000 bodies! They found this cemetery when they were renovating the church above. There is one baby girl \"sleeping beauty\" that died at age 2 in 1920 and her body is perfectly preserved. This attraction might not be for everyone. I throughly enjoyed it",
          "Never imagined it would be as it was - nothing like anything I've ever seen before. I'm glad I did see it though.",
          "We went here as I wanted to see the 2 year old Rosalina Lombardo preserved by a doctor who died before telling anyone how he did it. Its sad to see the children laid out & odd how the people aspired to be buried here hung up like pieces of meat. Rosalina was beautiful with",
          "If the Capuchins chose to store the human remains of their followers by hanging them in a catacomb, up to them. But displaying them to the public centuries later: what on earth is the point? Visit the Palazzo Zisa instead if you're in that part of town - another great example of",
          "Quite macabre. But if you can stomach it, it is fascinating and a unique experience. A one of a kind experience and place",
          "Since this is my first catacombs I rate it very good. Easy to maneuver, only had a bad smell in one small corner. Agreed, not much info on most of the corpses, but interesting to see various stages of decay and dress, and to read the markers in the floor. 3 euro entrance fee",
          "this is an attraction that is not suitable for everyone. i found it both interesting and compelling, but my other half found it somewhat distressing. if you do not mind seeing bodies that have not been moved since they have been placed then you will cope",
          "It may sound weird or creepy to go see dead people, but these catacombs are unlike others. Some of the bodies are hung on display next to each other, others are lying down. If there's one mummy you should definitely see it's the one of the little girl. She is so well preserved",
          "We had read the reviews and decided to go to this attraction. This is a good example of how society deals with death. Remains are located in different streets (men, women, professionals, children, clergy). Go in there with a sense of respect. This is not a peep show. No",
          "Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. This was not a burial place for just the monks, but for townspeople as well, especially the rich! Our guide explained the mummification process as well as the sentiment of the people back in the mid 1800s. I found it",
          "Definitely took turns with husband to have the 5 year old wait outside. The bodies inside are definitely what the nightmares of children are made of, but with that said it was very cool. The monk at the door was very nice. It only takes 10 minutes to see it all, but is amazing",
          "Very unique experience. Worth the trip. We have been all over the world and nothing like it. Straight out of a horror flick.",
          "Having missed the catacombs in Rome we managed to visit our first catacombs in Palermo. Very interesting seeing the way people had been remembered & the stages of decay following full or partial embalmment. And moving too, seeing the skeletons of little children and youths. A",
          "If you like a little \"horror\", visit this catacombs dating back only two centuries. Very strange way of burrying. Unique. One can ask questions about certain \"mummies\". Fakes ?",
          "We only went into a small part of the catacombs as my daughter and I both felt rather uncomfortable. Being surrounded by hundreds of dead people is not exactly entertainment.",
          "This was fascinating and worth a visit, but surprised that some people took their kids. Looking at the kids they were terrified as you could imagine with all the dead bodies hung on the walls.",
          "Not at all what we expected but interesting in a macabre way. I'm not sure the people interred there would have agreed had they known that 100 or so years later their coffins would be opened and their remains hung up for paying tourists to gawp at. Bizarre place !",
          "It was interesting but I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see this unless they are really fascinated by this type of attraction. The place can be stuffy and claustrophobic but luckily our visit was at an off-peak time with just a handful of people there so I",
          "Had heard about the Catacombs before visiting Palermo, so really wanted to see it but not sure what it would be like. Was a bit hard to find on foot. Well lit interior and good path once inside. Its a fascinating if rather creepy experience but would recommend it if you are",
          "We were travelling with my boyfriend with a group and our guide was not a fan of this-he was not even recommending it. So wrong! You shall definitely pay a visit when you are at Palermo and do include this on your main schedule. A bit creepy due to the fact that all skeletons",
          "It's eery but very interesting . You can see human bodies in different states of decay, some still with human hair intact. Read up before or later on the story of the young girl who died of pneumonia but is still well preserved",
          "I was intrigued by another traveler when I heard of the Catacombs and just had to go! It was definitely creepy and very interesting all at the same time. I'm glad I went, but have no need to go again!",
          "there are a bunch of dead people and nothing else. the corridors are suffocating and they lack story telling abilities. i would not recommend to spend your 3 euro admission fee here.",
          "A very strange visit. Never to be forgotten. Catacombs filled with hundreds of dead monk's and people , still in their upright position. Make sure you add it to your itinerary.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Catacombs. It was weird but really interesting. I was visiting as a day trip from a cruise ship stop off. There are lots of people offering excursions etc at the port where the ship docks. I asked specifically for a taxi to take me to the catacombs. The",
          "I went to the catacombs with my wife and her sister. It takes around 40 minutes to see everything, which means walking along the thematically arranged alleys - men, women, babies, virgins, monks etc. I had mixed feelings about the place. On one hand, it is a unique - and rather",
          "Weirdest place ever. Literally dead bodies pinned to the walls. Not for people who are claustrophobic. No smell of anything but you could feel a bit overwhelmed by the dead",
          "I had read about the catacombs prior to visiting and was keen to see them for myself. My partner and I visited on a Sunday around 3pm and it was busy but not overly so. The atmosphere is enjoyably creepy and the bodies are very well preserved! A guide book is available in",
          "We went to the catacombs whilst on a weekend break in Palermo because we had seen it on a TV programme. We walked there from the town centre. I am glad we visited as the place is interesting, if macabre. It is probably not every one's idea of an \"attraction\" so be prepared to",
          "I like anything creepy and weird and this was most certainly that. It's a bit out of the way and you only need about 20-30 minutes to wander through but it's unlike any catacombs I've ever seen because the bodies are so well preserved. I'll leave it at that. You'll have to see",
          "We visited the catacombs as part of an optional day trip whilst cruising with Norwegian Epic. It was morbid, and unless you like seeing hundreds of dead, musty, decayed bodies up close then I would steer clear of this place. It was interesting for about 5 minutes but the tour",
          "We drove for 30 min trying to find the place but didn't worry because trip adviser said they were open till midnight. We got there and they closed at 7:00.",
          "The catacombes are quite far from the city center so you may consider this if you want to walk in summer. The price is 3 euros and you are NOT allowed to take pictures, so I wonder how these images got into Tripadvisor:))) It s weird and not for sensitive souls but also not",
          "Very interesting and oddly peaceful. Originally Capuchin monks were \"buried\" here but then it apparently became a symbol of status for the family. We didn't go with a tour and I think it is a better experience without the noise of a large group. You can always read about it",
          "We went here due to the good reviews and the fact it was something out of the ordinary. Honestly I didn't like it at all; I felt very uncomfortable during the visit and only stayed a few minutes. A lot of the 'bodies' still have skin and hair intact and are fully clothed and",
          "I was just a kid when I went to the catacombs for the first time ... that night I didn't sleep. It seemed to have seen a horror film. However, today, forty years later, I suggest all tourists to see this charming place. You will see thousands of dead bodies, a few centimeters",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the trip and would recommend this venue wholeheartedly. I thought it might be a bit macabre but found it relaxing. We walked from the city centre and only took half an hour.",
          "Oh my god, one of the most scary and unique places I have ever been... definitely worth a visit, trust me you won't forget this!",
          "We didn't know what to expect. It was interesting. Off cappuccini road. There's corpses of babies , men and women. Either laying or hanging.",
          "The catacombs are filled with mummified bodies and skeletons of former residents of Palermo who died between the 17th and 19th centuries. For a modest entrance fee you descend steps into the underground tomb. It's a very strange sight seeing bodies still dressed in decayed",
          "I had never visited catacombs before but this was certainly an eye opener. A short tour to a location that is tucked away a good walk from the city centre. Well worth the visit especially if combined with looking at the next door cemetary",
          "Yes, it is weird looking at hundreds of mummified bodies. But, it is also very interesting. To think of why this was done and how. The bodies are in different stages of decay; some just bone and some with skin and hair. There are men, women, and children. It was difficult for me",
          "Very interesting but sacred repository of the deceased. Some most incredibly preserved by the atmosphere of the crypt; even dressed in original clothing. However left the place not entirely sure as to the purpose of the display and whether it was a customary place of worship of",
          "This catacomb is probably one of the I've ever seen. Displays of probably hundreds of bodies are neatly shown in vertical positions, horizontal as well, and many are still dressed to their finest. The expressions on their faces are all so different. Sections on family",
          "Amazing trip! Our guide Ricardo had a wealth of knowledge and is very passionate historian. Could have asked for a better guide.",
          "I planned this as my first stop on a Saturday morning, so arrived just prior to opening time at 9 AM. Only a few other visitors at that time, which was good. The catacombs themselves were a surprise, with skeletons still wrapped in their burial outfits hanging from hooks on the",
          "Well... this is pretty much what it says an underground tomb. The bodies are hanging from the walls and laying in stacked tombs. The decomposition varies and some still have hair and skin . It includes infants and children. Not for the faint hearted. There are no information",
          "Our guide took us to this place. We did not know what to expect. We all found it rather gruesome, being confronted with hundreds of mummified bodies. Some of these were hanging up while others were on shelves built in to the walls. I must say this is not for the faint hearted,",
          "This is quite amazing, however be warned you are confronted by death on all sides as you journey into the Catacombs, and walk amongst those who completed their lifes journeys centuries ago. In 1599 the Capuchinian monks (the drink Cappucino reminded the constructors of this",
          "The catacombs of the Capuchines, located just outside the city centre, are one of the most peculiar places to visit in Palermo. The mummies (rather skeletons), dressed in their contemporary costumes, make them look like a horror scene. At the same time, it is like a trip back",
          "Very macabre, one time visit only and Good value for money @ 3\u20ac each. Very interesting and thought provoking \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f Only downside of a local vagrant trying to charge for parking, and no need to do so.",
          "Easy to find. The man at the entrance is friendly and speaks english just enough. This place is really interesting, maybe a bit creepy for some at the beginning, but I'm sure anyone can easily get used to it. It's not too far from the center, I think it's worth giving it a try.",
          "We arrived at the catacombs at opening time (9 AM) and were the first in the door. The ticket seller was pleasant. The attraction was one of the places that my wife really wanted to see in Palermo. No pictures allowed inside but reasonable souvenirs at the entrance. Not for",
          "Well worth a visit here, entrance is cheap, and a visit will typically last 30 minutes. There is no smell - for those that may be concerned about this, and is not in the slightest bit scary or gory. There are in fact some very well preserved bodies, including one of a little",
          "We went there because we saw it on the internet. First outside you have the typical gipsy asking for money to let you park in a free zone. Then the ticket is 3\u20ac and they are not kind.",
          "This place is unlike any other on the planet. We had three teenagers in our group and they loved it. We all agreed it was the highlight of our two weeks in southern Italy and cannot be missed.",
          "First must say if you are a little aprensive dont even try to enter. Its literaly death dryed people exposed. Its part of the local history and one of those creepy places that dont have sense in nowa days. After all, one thing that cannot be seen anywhere else.",
          "Took a cab from a few blocks from the cruise terminal, wanted to wander a little. Catacombs were shocking and sad and very interesting. Highly recommend.",
          "The catacombs were so amazing, not morbid at all. It was incredible to be so close to the bodies and realize that this was a means of preserving (embalming) these bodies. The youngest little girl, Rosalia was somewhat sad due to her age of two. We had a tour guide who explained",
          "At the request of my daughter who already knew of the Catacombe in Palermo , we accompanied her in Dec 2016. I was not very comfortable inside. The place is in a large basement of an ancient building. Areas are sectioned off into different centuries of death and different",
          "Always wanted to see it since watching an episode about it on NG. It exceeded my expectations. It is what it is, nothing more nothing less. A must see if you are into an unusual things or rare things for that matter. I had young children with me too, and with prior explanation",
          "I've been to many catacombs before and this is one of my favourites! The entrance is inexpensive, pictures are not allowed and it's a 15\u20ac ride from the centre of the city.",
          "If you're into this kind of attractions, this is a great place for you. Medium sized catacombs with a lot of interestingly morbid skeletons and mummies, and the famously well preserved body of Rosalia Lombardo, which is said to sometimes blink. It is totally worth the visit, and",
          "This place is quite special. Rows and rows of bodies very differently preserved. Some were mummified, others just dried up. At the beginning I was surprised as how close you can be to these bodies, you could touch them, hug them if you wished :) You can try guessing who these",
          "It is the one of most impressive places to visit. This collection of mummified bodies does not seem very strange or fearful. I was touched to see a small girl of two years to be embalmed.",
          "just be prepared before it, for myself i was alone in the big alley and really it was very strange as some of the body looks like they are still alive!",
          "It will be kinda eerie if you visit the catacomb alone. do go with a friend or in a group. It is old but very interesting and eerie. I kinda enjoy the visit. Its not your usual tourist attraction. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "If your expectations are to be either thrilled by the ambience or spiritually lifted by the presence of death, forget it. You will find rows upon rows of skeletons amassed like old rifles in an old mothballed army armoury.",
          "strange collection of mummified bodies could be a bit disconcerting for some but we enjoyed it never seen as many bodies together before NB all ages",
          "This is definitely worth a visit to experience something completely different. We weren't sure what we would be seeing but it was so interesting to see the preservation of these old souls.",
          "A slightly disturbing and emotional place to visit, but worth experiencing. I wasn't sure what to expect, and was certainly taken aback to begin with.",
          "I has visited catacombs in a number of locations in Italy including Rome and Siracusa, but Palermo's display was just too much. The endless display of dead bodies hanging from the wall, including children was quite graphic. I understand the point of it being considered",
          "This is unusual but worth seeing. It depicts methods of body preservation. A 2-year-old child is preservedwho looks like she died yesterday. It is not for the faint of heart. Unlike other catacombs, here you see actual bodies. It really is an interesting place. Father A.",
          "Interesting place to visit to see Palermo's mummified dead. Some are as old as 500 years old. See also the most \"beautiful mummy\" (a 2 year old girl). Cost is 3\u20ac and there is a small gift shop where you get tickets. Be aware that photos are not allowed. Also, check hours",
          "I do not understand why people consider this place as \"fascinating\". it is full of mummified cadavers hanging by the neck from the walls in what appears to be a basement of Capuchin's convent. Yes that was the tradition of these times not to bury people (I assume), but if you",
          "We visited the Catacombs a morning during our stay to Palermo.The visit was lasted about an hour.Cheap ticket.It reminds you that life is short.Best part of it the little girl which it seems to sleep.",
          "A macabre, fascinating and at times rather sad insight into another world, bygone times and lives lived and lost/taken, sometimes far too soon. The catacombs house around 2,000 skeletons and mummified bodies, making it the largest and the most extraordinary collection of mummies",
          "Catacombs are quite easy to find, entrance is right of Capuchins cemetery in the corner. I gave only 4 stars because, there should be more extensive description of some mummies. Never the less, quite an experience....",
          "These so called \"catacombs\" are made of several corridors with dead people hanging on walls. Skeletons or mummied dressed and hanged on the walls, less than 1 meter from you. Somehow it didn't feel right.",
          "We walked from the center of town to the Catacombs. It was a bit of a walk but certainly doable and safe. We had been to the Capuchin Church in Rome and thought this would be an interesting comparison. I am =not sure what I expected but this is beyond words. I was amazed by",
          "If you are not from southern Italy, you havn't seen anything like this before. Don't come here to take pictures though: it would be considered as a lack of respect.",
          "It was a surreal experience. Walking along the corridors watching all these people who were just like me, but beyond the realm of life. A very humbling and meaningful experience. This place is very powerful.",
          "Having seen the Catacombs in Rome years ago, so I went on a whim, did not do any research before visiting. The Catacombs of the Capuchins are different. Skeletons are displayed hanging on the walls, lying in coffins..... Did not dare to look at the faces, only viewing the",
          "I walked to the catacombs, through the bustling noise, heat and stink of Palermo. The route is signposted, but you will also have to use your instincts to find the exact location, which isn't obvious if you just follow the signs. You enter via a ticket office banked with",
          "The bodies in these catacombs are mummified and clothed. There are adults and babies. Some might say you have to be a ghoul to be interested in this place, but we found it compelling. Some of the corpses are hundreds of years old, one or two in fact are dressed in Napoleonic",
          "Not necessarily a \"must see,\" but an experience. I have know about them for decades but just went to visit.",
          "I visited the catacombs because my friends wanted to see them. There is a small entrance fee. It was interesting to see how the corpses were categorized, for instance, professionals, virgins, etc. I don't think I'd want to go back again. It is worth seeing once.",
          "These mummies are not well preserved. The mummification process used here left a lot to be desired. The effect will be different for each visitor. I was scared to go in, but ended up laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle. Personally I find it disrespectful of the dead to",
          "This is not like any other catacombes I've ever seen or heard of ,8000 bodies,most hanging on walls in niches fully clothed, in various stages of decomposition (one small child from the 1920 looks as if just sleeping others look like uncle fester in the Adams family.earliest I",
          "You've just got to see this and reflect how it makes you feel, amazing! The whole visit is just amazing, not sure it's a family visit though",
          "The only time we've seen people who have been preserved! What a crazy idea and tradition. A must see if you are in the area!",
          "Won't see stuff like this back in the States. Yes, creepy, but the history of why and what is something to see. The monks did a great job in preserving history of the past. Do not take pictures...they will he'll at you if caught lol.",
          "Worth the visit if you want to see what happens to the human body after death. Interesting tour under the ground in semi dark around 100's years old bodies.",
          "Worth seeing but it's creepy afterwards some of the mummies are scarry as... kids especially but no regrets thing to see definitely",
          "Thousands of skeletons and mummified bodies staring at you as they hang on the walls. Eerie, creepy and strangely fascinating all at the same time. The guide was knowledgeable but spoke softly and I had to jockey toward the front to hear. Been there once - that's enough.",
          "We have visited catacombs before but nothing like this! Literally hundreds of mummified bodies out for all to see. It's very confronting when you first enter and see the first long corridor of bodies in various stages of preservation and decay. If you are lucky enough to be",
          "Go and see it! It will make you look at people differently when you know how they look inside. 8000 corps",
          "Fully dressed skeletons and mummified bodies from the XVIII-XIX century, hanging on the walls. Separate corridors for the monks, for the priests, for the craftsmen, the children, and the virgins.Very special atmosphere.",
          "We visited the catacombs because it was something different. If you are freaked out by death or mummies, this is not a destination to visit for you. However, if you are wanting to see some interesting history, this is definitely unique. We had a tour guide, so we were",
          "Whilst in Palermo this is a must see. Very strange experience looking a dead people. Okay during the day but wouldn't like to be locked in at night!\ud83d\ude04 Only thing that annoyed me was the amount of people disrespecting the notices everywhere not to take photos!",
          "I like catacombs and their mystery atmosfere... but Catacombs of the Capuchins are just exhibition of dead bodies with no respect to them. After my visit I felt uneasy and unsettled.",
          "This is a must visit when in Palermo. Forget the high priced tours ... Entrance is only 3 Euro... and the Catacombs are accessible by a leisurely walk or taxi. Historically... fantastic... just remember... it is a crypt",
          "Don't prepare beforehand, just visit, then read about it afterwards... and if you have time, the cemetery next door is worth a look, including Giuseppe Tomasa di Lampadusa's grave (ask for help, it's not easy to find).",
          "Not at all what I expected from catacombs. Dead bodies/ skeletons hanging from the walls, warehouse feeling. I know there is a religious aspect there and this is how it was done in the 18th/ 19th century. However, taking money and admitting groups of people without possibly the",
          "If you don't like dead people do not go here! It's a strange place but in its way beautiful. All those corpses hanging there for so many years some for 100 years. I'm glad I've visited this place! It left an impression!",
          "This was our first visit to a Catacomb. We have heard of catacombs in Rome and other places (including in Paris) but have never visited one. This was an interesting experience, but it is not for everyone.",
          "A rather unexpected group of hanging skeletons with clothes and sometimes hair. Mainly holy people and those of high rank. Not for the faint hearted.",
          "The catacombs are int he basement level of the Monasterio dei Capuccini in Palermo, and it consists of corridors covered with mumificated dead bodies. Some of them unbelievingly well preserved... so much that it can give you creeps! All in all, it is one of the miracles and",
          "This place will not be to everyone's taste,facinating , interesting,even creepy, to be allowed to see these bodies displayed for all to see may seem wrong ,but obviously to the monks and the local people who were allowed to be interned here was a final honour.for me and my wife",
          "Not easy to find, so check before going. Closed during middle of the day and reopens 3pm. Cost is reasonable at 3 euros. Hundreds of corpses line niches in the walls of these catacombs, some are embalmed some just skeletons. Many are still clothed. Utterly weird and a bit",
          "I read about this is one of the most scary museum in the world. And it was so indeed.you should see here if you visit Palermo. Bodies were like as if they had just died. Their skin, hair and clothes were still intact.",
          "It is a really interesting place to go if you haven't been in catacombs before. You will be disturbed by the quality of the mommys. Don't look at them too long ;-)",
          "I didn't know what to expect going down those stairs to the underground room full of catacombs. But it was definitely not what I felt : I had a mixture of emotions that made me feel humble and pushed me to appreciate life and what has been given to us to use it for the good of",
          "I doubt that you will ever see anything like this again. A visit to the Catacombs is unique and fascinating. However maybe not for the faint hearted, but certainly a must do while you are in Palermo",
          "Would highly recommend but be advised if you have kids it might not leave a pretty picture in their head, not that it is scary in any kind if way to my perspective but i cant say the same for kids.",
          "I went there with my sister and spent over an hour there just analyzing everything. So many details, so many stories untold. We wished we had background stories of some of them, because we were so curious. It's amazing, will definitely come back one day!",
          "A fascinating insight into the lives (and death) of Sicilians in 1850's. The main attraction is the well persevered remains of Rosalie Lombardo but just seeing the clothing and the coffins give an amazing insight into this history. Great and unique experience.",
          "A seriously weird experience. Dozens of skeletal remains line the walls of this catacomb, decked out in their Sunday best, staring down at the gawping visitors. Some have their mouths hanging open, some have heads caved in. You walk down rows arranged by designation - men,",
          "Possibly the strangest, most macbre tourist attraction we've ever heard of, nevermind visited. still talking about it nearly a week after we've been, considering we've also seen an opera, been up a volcano and visited ustica that's saying something. Definitely pay the 3\u20ac to",
          "While the Catacombs are described as being 'behind\" the Cathedrial, and indeed tney are, they're not close behind. We took a taxi from the Four Corners and were glad we did. The driver told us our visit would be only 15-20 minutes and he was right on target. he offered a flat",
          "It was quite weird to walk among all those people who decided to put themselves in here. Not haunting at all if you ask me but weird... interesting but weird and luckily not that big.",
          "A very thought provoking and eerie place to visit.........who were the people? how did they live? many wear clothes, and some are so well preserved they look closely to how they would have been in life.",
          "Not an atraction that will be to everones tastes - as a doctor I am not phased by death - but the presentation of death here might be shocking to some. Historical - Yes Cultural - Certainly Worth a visit - In my opinion yes definately",
          "The tradition of mummification was long present in Sicily. However those mummies were mostly skeletons. It is a bit morbide, out of town and I would not go again (yes they have the most beautiful mummy in the world).",
          "This place was fascinating, but I do know some folks who could NEVER visit this site [definitely NOT for young children.] A different way of doing things I'd say. Bodies, bodies and more bodies, every age and size displayed by hanging from the walls, laid on shelves or in",
          "I went here to see my relatives and the little girl they said had died in 1925 where they preserved her body. She did not look as good as she did for all those years. For some reason they opened up her casket I guess to look and find out how she was preserved, and for some",
          "I didn't quite know what to expect, but this was a bit more disturbing than i thought it would be. People that like this stuff will love it!",
          "Lots and lots of dressed up skeletal remains from the mid-19th century. My favorites were the Admirals and Priests. Very sad to see the babies and young kids. Disappointed that they don't allow photos, but do I really want a selfie with a corpse?",
          "This place is totally bizarre. I visited with my girlfriend who struggles to stay interested in museums/ galleries and the like. The walls of the catacombs are completely filled with preserved dead bodies. It's quite eerie and creepy to walk around but also very very",
          "This is the place to go to appreciate the reasons why a culture would do something like this. Don't think about the morbitity of it, just go for the historical and religious aspects and the history. My cousin, who is in his 80s tells me when he was a kid...as they lived nearby,",
          "Rows and rows of bodies lie in these Catacombs. Interesting thing to visit - very unique experience. Far removed from our hotel, so hotel ride was a necessity. Very expensive to get there - but very reasonable to visit.",
          "We visited the Catacombs on a Sunday - having read so many reviews about NOT driving around Palermo during the week! It was easy to find on SatNav and we parked without a problem. Quite a friendly man behind the desk with a little English, didn't try to sell me anything I didn't",
          "Exclusive experience, weird feeling, very impressive. A bit far from the center by feet but it's worth it. No picture allowed",
          "Thousands of bodies are hanging on the walls, dressed in their dust covered 1600s finery, and some still even have skin. It's fascinating, and worth a trip to Palermo just to see it. Free parking is right in the plaza outside the building, but give the amiable keeper of the cars",
          "We walked to the catacombs which is a bit of a walk from central station. But you can walk via a variety of other tourist atractions so that worked out fine. There is a \u20ac3 entree fee and photo's and film are not allowed. Some people did take pictures whoch was very",
          "Went here after seeing the advertising. Parking is difficult right outside and there are parking touts trying to get you to leave your car with them. Just go around the corner and there are plenty of free spaces to park. It costs \u20ac3.00 to go in which is not dear. As you walk",
          "We visited last year as part of a Thomson tour and found the experience shocking. One couple left immediately, visibly upset and commenting they didn't need to see this. If you have suffered a traumatic experience make sure you are fully aware. I hadn't fully appreciated what",
          "We went on a Sunday and it was open in case anyone wonders about hours. We didn't look up much history about the place but it was still interesting to see. I suggest understanding it a bit more.. it will probably be more fun to you if you do.",
          "In one word- amazing! I have visited Paris catacombs which are really impressive in size and atmosphere but here things are even more creepy- bodies with clothes ranged by their gender, position in the society. For those who can not watch horror movies I do not recommend. But",
          "Yes you are about to walk down corridors full of skeletons, many still wearing the clothes of the time they died in. Some still have hair and dried skin. After the initial shock of being surrounded by so many creepy faces leaning out towards you as you walk past you do begin to",
          "Don't miss these catacombs which include the rooms where the bodies are slowly drained and then hung up to dry! It is a bit hard to find with winding streets, but well worth the effort!",
          "Very interesting but had an awful nights sleep. The presentation is done very well and because we had a private guide was informative.",
          "This was on our list of places we really wanted to go. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I just found it very very weird and felt like a voyeur. Some of the skeletons are in a bad state, heads dropping off etc but I guess you would be too if you were 300 years old! The",
          "hidden off the beaten tourist track, this is an unusual site. I wasn't sure how Id feel wandering around several hundred mummified remains. It's eerie and peaceful at the same time. Worth visiting.",
          "Its not the \"politically correct\" site for manistream tourism. I found it very interesting though. Even the word catacombes brings to mind something very subterranean this site is def not. Its a big basement with \"storing\" any kind of human skull. Its like a huge art",
          "This was an interesting if very somber experience. It's interesting to see how different the monks attitude was to death as well as other people that followed their example of having the bodies of their loved ones embalmed so they could be visiting and seen any time. Thought",
          "If you're a little bit curious, morbid, and sick--as I consider myself--you'll probably get a kick out of this place. Fans of Europe's Weirdest Dead People Exhibits like the crypts in Rome, Sedlec(CR), etc. will enjoy the preserved fashions of bygone eras, and strange, often",
          "This crypt is extremely interesting. It contains large amounts of corpses and skeletons dressed in the clothing they were buried in. Women, Men and Children there doesn't appear to be a rhyme or reason on how they are displayed.",
          "While it does show you what it promises: dried out bodies in catacombs, it doesn't have the atmosphere I associated it with. Its clean and well lit passageways take you past many skeletons and mummies, some with original clothing. Occasionally an individual body is highlighted",
          "We were not disappointed. It would be best to do a bit of research before hand to help with the visit. Palermo is a bit of a gritty city and this place for that bill.",
          "I've been there just once, but I promise never visit it once again. There are hundreds of mummificated bodies and skeletons. The air stinks of death. Please, do not take there children or people of not strong spirit.",
          "This was disappointing for our group of five. The man at the ticket booth was charming while he was trying to sell us a book about the place but when we chose not to buy the book his attitude changed and he became quite rude and off-handed. I feel that it would not be",
          "Gazing into the faces of mummified corpses in various states of arrested decomposition is not for everyone. But, for me, once the initial discomfort passed there emerged a sense of serenity and, even, beauty. Some of the people here died young. Some violently. Some at end of",
          "Super stunning mummies and skulls, skeletons and caskets. Really impressive. Entry fee was \u20ac3 per person which is totally ok for what you will see. Photos and film is not allowed btw.",
          "A significant walk from the town centre, but well worth it. Over 8000 bodies, dating back to the early 18th century. Some were very well preserved and their clothes were intact. Amazing to spend time imagining who they were in life. Other visitors were loud, shouting and",
          "I expected better preserved bodies. Rooms without air conditioning, wet. Only bones and clothes are preserved. I thought it would be more impressive.",
          "A little unique place . Must be seen . A little difficult for kids may be ... But for a unique experience and make you realize you are not here for ever",
          "Unique place int Palermo, with thousands and thousands mummies from different centurys. Historical and respectful display of a long death. Must see it.",
          "Don't skip that. It's a bit of scary actually and we weren't capable to spent much time inside the catacombs, but it has that \"something completelly different\" appeal.",
          "A unique experience for the hard of stomach! I would advise hiring a guide to understand the history of the catacombs. Inconveniently there are no waiting facilities during its lunch closure.",
          "Row after row of skeletons most dressed in their finest attire, family groupings, professional associations, church hierarchy, creepy and interesting",
          "The catacombs are in great shape. they are really nicely curated. The bodies are quite explicit so be warned, you might get nightmares after this visit.",
          "Is a must see objective if you visit Palermo just because is a unique kind of monument. Like a common mortuary mausoleum that describes the tradition of the ancient times. Not suitable for kids. Creepy and could give nightmares if you a heart suffering.",
          "Interesting place to visit - creepy but fascinating to see! Doesn't take that long to go around the entire exhibition maybe 30minutes at most. Not a far walk from the Palazzo Reale.",
          "Creepy but intriguing. Well worth visiting. Slightly out of town. We took 20 mins to walk there. There are buses.",
          "Mixed feelings about this... husband and son really seemed to like it but I found it a bit odd in that all these skeletons were on display. I wonder how people would have felt if they knew this is what would happen to them hundreds of years or so after they have paid to be",

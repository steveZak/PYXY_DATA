        "wiki": "Cork City Gaol is a former prison, now a museum, located in Cork City, Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1806 an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the building of a new Cork City Gaol to replace the old gaol at the Northgate Bridge (the old gaol, which was nearly 100 years old, was on a confined site and was overcrowded and unhygienic). The first site chosen for the new prison was at distillery fields, but this site was later deemed to be unsuitable because it was prone to flooding. A site on Sunday's Well was eventually chosen, its altitude being seen as an advantage for containing \"gaol fever\" (typhus). The site, its approach roads and perimeters was commenced in 1816 and the building of the prison proper started in 1818.The building was designed by William Robertson of Kilkenny and built by the Deane family. The famous sculptor, John Hogan worked on the building as a draughtsman.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe new Cork City Gaol opened in 1824 and was reported as being \"the finest in 3 kingdoms\".In 1870 the west wing was remodelled into a double-sided cell wing.\n\n\n== City gaol ==\nWhen the prison opened in the 1820s it housed both male and female prisoners, whose crimes were committed within the city boundary. Anyone committing a crime outside that boundary were committed to the County Gaol, across the river from the City Gaol near University College Cork.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nThe Fenian Brian Dillon was remanded at Cork City Gaol when he was arrested in September 1865.\n\n\n== Women's gaol (city and county) ==\nThe 1878 General Prisons (Ireland) Act reorganised the prisons in Cork. The Cork City Gaol became a women's gaol (for Cork City and Cork County) and the Cork County Gaol near UCC became the men's gaol (for Cork City and Cork County). On the day the change came into effect, male prisoners were marched out of the Sunday's Well Prison and over to the Western Road Gaol, while the women were marched in the opposite direction.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nMany of the prisoners in the late 19th century were repeat offenders locked up for what would not today be imprisonable offences; for example, a woman named Mary Tucker from Rathmore in County Cork was imprisoned at least three times between 1849 and 1908, sometimes for offences such as 'Obscene Language' or 'Drunkenness'.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the Irish War of Independence Republican women prisoners were imprisoned in the gaol.In October 1919, Constance Markievicz, the first woman to be elected to the British Parliament, was imprisoned at Cork Gaol for making a seditious speech.In January 1919, another member of Cumann na mBan, Mary Bowles, was imprisoned for arms offences. Later that month a Republican prisoner named Dolly Burke escaped from the prison.\n\n\n== Civil War ==\nIn 1922 and 1923, the prison was opened to male and female Republican (anti-treaty) prisoners of the Irish Civil War.One of those imprisoned at the time was the writer Frank O'Connor.A spectacular escape was made from the gaol in November 1923. The escapees were high-value prisoners who had been sent to the gaol as it was \"the safest place to hold them\". Some men had feigned illness on the night preceding the escape. A rope ladder was made to scale the outer wall, and bed clothes were used to descend to the ground by night. After the prisoners had lowered themselves to the ground inside the wall, they had to huddle in its shadow in sight of a sentry. The position of the moon at a certain hour had to be estimated in order to conceal the movements of the men in the shadows. They went in batches of fourteen as that was the number that could fit in the shadow of the wall, the most wanted men being given preference in order of the serious nature of their charges. All the men in the first batch were liable to the death penalty and cast lots for the order in line. When number nine went over the wall some noise attracted the sentry, and he made movements which caused the prisoner to balk. After a few moments silence, the action was resumed, and three batches amounting to forty two men, escaped with a lapse of fifteen minutes between each batch. It was a frosty night and they had to travel in stockinged feet. Some of those who escaped were natives of Cork City and got clear of there before daylight, but others in the last few batches were recaptured later in the day.The gaol closed in August 1923, with all remaining prisoners either released or transferred to other prisons.\n\n\n== Post 1923 ==\nFrom 1927 the top floor of the Governors house was used as a radio broadcasting station by 6CK, the first official radio station in Cork, Ireland.\n6CK was succeeded by a national radio station \u2013 Radio \u00c9ireann (now Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann), and broadcasting continued at the gaol until the 1950s.Apart from the radio broadcasting and some storage use of the exterior grounds by the Dept, Posts & Telegraphs, the gaol complex was allowed to become totally derelict.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe building reopened to the public as a visitor attraction in 1993.\n\n\n== Former prisoners ==\nBrian Dillon, 1865\nConstance Markievicz, 1919\nFrank O'Connor (born Michael Francis O'Connor O'Donovan), 1923\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Cork City Gaol at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nCity of Cork : St. Mary's Shandon Parish : sheet XVIII.43 1869 Ordnance Survey Ireland map; Cork City Gaol plan is in the botton right (southeast) corner.",

          "Really enjoyable visit to the Gaol, especially as it was a rainy day. I had 2 small kids with me and they loved being able to run around in and out of the cells. It was Halloween so there was a free treasure hunt on for them and it was really really enjoyable and they got a",
          "We were stuck for something to do in Cork City on a rainy day and decided to go here. Would thoroughly recommend it, fun, educational and for the older kids there's a bit for them too. They've stocks you can get into and the mannequins add a nice touch. If you're a history buff",

          "I had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Cork City Gaol. I don\u2019t know if they offer guided tours (I think they do?) but I was offered a self-guided tour to which I could add an audio guide (I chose not to). There are over twenty different stops throughout the jail that",
          "Interesting visit to the Gaol, an audio guide is to prefer, it makes the tour more alive. You really get the feeling of how it was to be a prisoner at that time.",
          "We found Cork Gael very interesting and informative, well worth a visit, but we thought it was a bit expensive.",

          "I paid a euro or two extra and did the audio tour, well worth that little bit extra. The staff here are extremely helpful and explain how to get the most out of the museum without being pushy. The Gaol itself has been restored but I was delighted to see that there are still",

          "So different to other gaols I visited. We didn\u2019t enjoy it at all plus very pricey \u20ac10 each for adults. We walked miles then found out someone moved the signpost. When I said it to the girl at the desk she said nothing is been done it happens all the time",
          "Quite a shock to see what the conditions and the reason for there sentencing was like some from the age of 10 surprise to see the difference in the way it was and how it is now you have a device that tells you all about the history of it and very helpful staff who are",

          "Having walked to the City Gaol we were gasping for a drink when we reached the top & the lovely lady in the small gift shop accommodated with a cup of tea upon arrival. The props & the individual biogs are extremely well done. There was some filming taking place on the day we",

          "Had a really fun experience at the Gaol, we were there about an hour and there\u2019s some really good information about the history of the building and the prisoners it housed. Also some really good displays about the history of radio. Definitely worth seeing if you\u2019re nearby!",

          "My parents, husband and I visited the Cork City Gaol at my dad's behest and I have to say I was surprisingly entertained. I am not much of a history buff and usually do not get much into historical tours but this one was quite good. The tour guides are full of stories about",

          "Brought my nephew and sister here when they were visiting and it was really good. There was the option to have an audio tour or a tour guide. We went with the latter and was very interesting. The radio museum was really cool, and great for kids.",
          "Very interesting tour. I would recommend getting the audio tour, well worth the extra charge. Well laid out displays.",
          "A definite highlight in a trip to cork city. Beautiful architecture with a heartbreaking but true story of a historic city. Give yourself about 1-2 hours to visit. Absolutely get the audio guide, helpful, interesting and so worth it. Interpretation and presentation of the site",

          "Not too expensive and we were there for 1-2 hours! Wax figures are good too. You definitely need the audioguide, really informative with loads of extra information, only \u20ac2. Radio museum at the end was a bit random but also good. No caf\u00e9 unfortunately and tiny gift shop. Very",
          "We had probably seen too many Castles and Manor homes by the time we got to Cork so visiting a Goal (Jail) seemed to be something different to do. It was well worth the effort. You get to see the goal buildings and the old cells but of equal (if not more) interest was the",
          "Me and Becky walked here and would recommend the hop on hop off bus as was a mile and a half uphill. The building was sublime and the inside told a story however was no guided tours which let it down. Not as good as Spike Island however still very good",
          "Set high on a hill above the city of Cork is the old city gaol ( jail). The easiest way to get there is by taking the hop on hop off city tour bus from the town centre as the jail is one of the seven hop on/off points en route. Not surprisingly, this is an old building and it",
          "This jail is extremely old and shows the true representation of what life use to be for anyone that went to jail. The building is ancient yet kept in very good condition to show what it was like back in the day. The grounds surrounding the jail gives a preview of life in those",
          "Self-guided tour; good information about the jail, its historic uses and some of the people incarcerated there. About 20-25 minute walk from the Bridge Street bridge.",

          "If you want to step back in time a visit to Cork City Goal is a must, so interesting the history of this jail & so well told by the tour guide.....",
          "Two flowerbeds grace the roadway in front of Cork Jail. You won't notice them entering. You can't miss them leaving. A riot of colour and beauty, in stark contrast to the darkness and gloom inside the cells. Despite my reluctance to describe prisons as wonderful structures (from",
          "We visited Cork gaol in April the entrance fee was reasonable and the visit very informative along the way. The fact sheets give you a fascinating insight to the conditions within the gaol and there are a number of different exhibitions throughout the gaol. Well worth a",
          "This was a good thing to do whilst in cork. It was really interesting and not very expensive. The staff there were very nice. We had a book and it told us all about the inmates etc.",
          "I found this place really interesting and well set up. There are a series of different signs and wax figures setting up scenes to show you the history of the place and specific case studies. There were three options for tours: - Self guided with the map which had some",
          "I visited here with my two boys and despite being really interested in history we found this a little dull and not that interesting at all. We have visited Kilmainham in Dublin so maybe our expectations were too high after that. The radio exhibit is most likely only interesting",
          "Made the journey from Cork City, to the Gaol. Unfortunately we found the journey was a bit of a nightmare, due to a Bridge being closed, so if your thinking of cutting across the Park, and over Dalys Bridge DONT. We then had to walk all the way round the long way, and up Sunday",
          "This was a stop on the hop on/off bus and we were happy we decided to visit. We spent about an hour here and did the self guided audio tour. Very informative- the kids really enjoyed it. I only wish we got to visit the dungeon!",

          "It was worth checking out. The history was interesting and the guide was knowledgeable. Tours are part of the ticket price.",
          "I\u2019m surprised so many people enjoyed this so much. We did the self-guided tour and got through it super quickly. I didn\u2019t find it to have a ton of interesting stories/history, at all. Basically just 10 statues in various rooms with a small blurb about why they were in prison. I",
          "I visited this with my young children and despite the protests beforehand, they really enjoyed it! We walked from the centre of Cork which was a bit of a hike but it looked like there was lots of parking and the sight seeing bus stopped there too. Very informative tour which is",
          "We went with little kids they really enjoyed! The tour guide was knowledgeable enough. Explained well for the kids.Not to long. We had a great time !",
          "We took the guided tour and our guide didn\u2019t really seem very expressive. They were quite monotone and it just seemed they were remembering their script and wanted to get us through the tour as soon as possible. The place itself was interesting, beautiful and clean. If we had a",

          "Great time very informative would definitely recommend would recommend 2 hours to visit the attractions",
          "Interesting, quirky, kinda spooky place to go. We had adults & kids in our group. Kids from 5 up would enjoy it. There are steps but it is wheelchair friendly also. They've a small cafe & gift shop too, although the cafe is upstairs. This place was surprisingly interesting & fun",
          "Take the guided tour, the staff is knowledgable and personal. Amazing stories about real people and the harsh prison conditions of those times. The total visit takes a little more than an hour, not counting the radio museum that is also housed in the former prison. The guides",

          "We visited on a whim and really enjoyed the tour. Jail has been nicely restored and the tour tells you about not just life in an Irish jail in 1860 but about some of the specific prisoners including women and children. A large set of buildings, grounds and a coffee shop on",

          "The tour guide at 10am this morning was so knowledgeable and she maid it so enjoyable and exciting when she was talking about the place the passion was in her about the place. Give her a raise or a bonus she is a great asset to the place.",
          "Did guided tour and learnt a lot about some of the prisoners that were held in this gaol. Was then able to go back to look at anything that I felt I needed more time for - this was very useful. The guide I had was very informative and it was obvious that she enjoyed what she",
          "Excellent museum, well worth visiting!! Jail is at a bus stop in Cork City Tour - ticket valid for 24 hours from time of purchase. Sits high on a hill in a suburb about ten minutes from city centre, a great museum, good place to pass a couple of hours. Opportunity to step back",
          "Having visited Crumlin Road, Kilmainham Gaol, and Spike Island, this visit left us feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Having opted for the guided tour we felt that it was too focused on individual prisoner stories and omitted key information such as, for example, executions that",
          "Very interesting place, been presented very well and the tour guide was excellent. Kept it interesting throughout and kept people included. Definitely the must see attraction for a visit to Cork.",
          "While In cork city do visit the Gaol. The Tour was okay. A lot of history associated with past Irish rebellions. The building and grounds surrounding it are impressive. You could skip this attraction but if you have an interest in goals or Irish rebellions it\u2019s worth a stop.",
          "It was very interesting and informative. They had made up the cells with people in them making the stories more interesting.",
          "There is so much to see and areas that have not been renovated but you get a taste of how depressing it would have been to have ever been incarcerated here",
          "This gem is on the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour. I did the self-guided tour, which was nice, as you can spend as much time as you wish learning about the place and taking in all of the information. The tales held in this place are both fascinating and sad. Don't miss out on the",
          "We went early in the morning any avoided the bigger crowds. We got to experience the gaol at our own pace. The kids got an activity worksheet and really enjoyed the quiz.. many interactive elements to keep children busy. Staff were super helpful. People can get a free tour guide",
          "What a great way to spend an hour or two. The audio tour was fantastic. We were lucky enough to just miss a large group of school children. It wouldn't have been much fun if we had to share the gaol with 100s of kids. Well priced too.",
          "its just an amazing place the best thing is the audio guide, it will enable you to live the experience",
          "A visit to the Gaol has been on my Aunt's list of to do in Cork city. We had s lovely couple of hours walking around looking at cells and the different areas within the Gaol. Her grandchildren had the audio tour and they loved it. All the staff were very pleasant and we had a",
          "A wonderful experience - there were 150 Italian students there , that made it a little busy (they seemed to have left their manners at home) but the staff were apologetic and advised us alternative ways to go around them. An amazing building well worth the trip. Great coffee",
          "Fascinating historical view. Brings home how many of our American ancestors ended up in the US and Australia.",
          "The architecture of this building is very interesting. More like a castle than a prison. It is quite interesting but would not hold the attention of children for too long. The staff do not interact with you and basically you are left to potter round and there is an audio guide",
          "This is well worth a visit. The audio tour provides a lot of information about the people who were held there and gives a real impression of how bad it must have been",
          "I had my reservations about visiting this attraction on a three day visit to Cork; however, I was very pleasantly surprised. it was a very interesting few hours, well spent in a nicely presented asset demonstrating a part of Cork and Irish history. Interactive enough and",
          "The Gaol is an excellent tour. We\u2019d been planning this one from early in the planning stages of our trip, and we weren\u2019t disappointed. From our start in the historic Shandon area, it\u2019s a bit of a walk, with a good portion being uphill, so wear some comfortable shoes or take",
          "WOW! We visited the gaol on a very rainy day, maybe it helped create the mood? However the sad history that was recounted in this institution was incredible, the effort that has been taken to restore and preserve this building, recreate accurate scenes from a time long past is",
          "Superb attraction, we opted for the audio guide which was both informative and clear. A great morning out, though I can\u2019t help thinking that an opportunity is being missed... how about offering a night in the gaol, England has many attractions based on this theme and all seem to",
          "You will love this place , if you want to know what prison is like hundreds of years ago, this is the place. it is beautiful piece of property, but not for a prisoner during the 1800's history buffs have to go here , nice displays.",
          "This was the city jail for Cork. It was built almost 200 years ago and has stood the test of time. The conditions there we were told were not the most pleasant. It housed both men and women prisoners but later became a women's prison. It closed and prisoners were relocated",
          "Built in the early 1800's, it was considered one of the finest prisons in Ireland. You can see prisoner writings on some of the walls. It was a City prison housing both men and women inside its walls. It closed in 1923 when the prisoners were relocated and opened as a Museum",
          "Very interesting and well done. Highly recommend the audio tour. Takes about 45 minutes. Kids (12 & 14) enjoyed it too.",
          "Very interesting site and lots of information to help you understand the history and the people involved. Not too bad a walk from Cork centre up the hill, about 25 mins.",
          "This was in my top 3 places whilst in Cork for a couple of days. Loved the Audio tour as it brought it to life and what an amazing building. Paid 10 euros on the door and 2 extra for audio which is really worth it .",
          "Anyone visiting this attraction should realize that only a small area is actually open on two levels but good info on the history of the jail. A nice area in the gardens to relax but no proper cafe. Not worth paying the money for \u20ac10 each and \u20ac2 for head piece which in reality",
          "They try to make it \"fun\" and interactive but it's still a dark subject. You do learn how bad it was for prisoners at the time...",
          "A great place to visit to get to know daily life in prison in early years. The audiotour is very well done.",
          "High above the city is the Cork City Gaol, actually a set of beautiful buildings (if you ignore what they were created for) in a beautifully landscaped environment. The buildings, at least those parts that you can tour, and wonderfully restored. We did the self guided tour",
          "We took a brilliant guided tour of Cork City Gaol. Fantastic insight into the grim history of the penal system in Victorian Ireland. Interesting information on the various characters who affected the social history of Cork and the whole country as seen through their relationship",
          "The Cork City Jail is worth a visit. A sad history that needs to be told. Using the audio tour made the stories come to life, and transported us back in time. Made us glad weren\u2019t born into that time. The history of radio museum was a nice bonus.",
          "This is well worth the trip up the hill to visit. The information Guide that comes with admission is very well done and guides you through each section. You can opt for an audio tour.",
          "Visited as part of the city bus tour. Hardest part for us was to realize that these cells were actually used by people. The part of tour where you saw where inmates had written on the walls was very moving.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Cork city gaol. It\u2019s a really impressive building and has been beautifully restored. The gardens at the front are lovely and there are some picnic benches. We got the audio tour and it was well worth the extra charge of \u20ac2 per headset. The audio",
          "Walked from town using a city map, this was easy enough. A lovely gentleman offered his directions as well - obviously we looked like visitors with map in hand. Arrived and the unassuming entrance was the beginning of an interesting walk around this attraction. The guide book",
          "An interesting place to visit. Very easy to walk around and follow the information sheet. Adults and children will enjoy it. Very history and well presented. A hint - it can be chilly in there so take a jacket.",
          "Great tour! The audio tour option was absolutely the way to go! It was nice to go at our own pace AND have someone tell us about the exhibits! The displays are crazy life-like! Great picture opportunities!",
          "Interesting place, just the right amount of information on each section in the guide leaflet. Possibly not for younger children as it it looking and reading, nothing really interactive. Glad we went, good bit of history.",
          "We got off at this stop on open top bus tour. Unsure what to expect but incredibly interesting historical site. Needed about 1.5-2 hours to take in fully. Audio tour recommended and only \u20ac2.",
          "Very good history about what the poor people had to put up with in the prison very harsh.Women ,children men .",
          "This is a MUST see! It is brilliant! A piece of history that must be visited. It is a little further up a hill but well woth the visit. Friendly and helpful staff as well so thank you so much.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Gaol. A fascinating and chilling insight into what it was like to end up in the Gaol - sometimes for the most trivial reasons. And sometimes it was because the promise of food and a bed, was so much better than what life was on the outside.",
          "Really enjoyed my visit to the city gaol. The gardens are beautiful and the exterior is impressive. We got the audio tour which we thought was well worth the extra charge. The audio guide had a wonderful voice and great delivery of the information. The tour is historical and",
          "We visited the Gaol on the strength of numerous reviews on here extolling the virtues of this place. However I have to say my better half and I were disappointed. At \u20ac12 per adult (inc. audio guide) I thought what you paid for was a bit of a let down. The Gaol is quite small",
          "This was a functional jail for many years. The self guided tour is very informative. You learn a good deal about how terrible it was to be poor in the 1800s. Nice to have family pricing, makes it affordable for a good size family.",
          "The tour was a bit short but it was educational. It is an audio tour guide. It costs twelve euro which I thought was a bit steep. You only really see one wing. But it was worth it",
          "Advertised as 'Cork's Most Captivating Experience', I would say it probably lives up to its name. This early nineteenth century building served as the City Gaol from 1824, by 1878 it was designiated as a women's gaol. It served right up until the Civil War when both male and",
          "Very interesting place, gives good insight into the plight of prisoners in the late 1800's and early 1900's.",
          "It is a huge and impressive place, and there were lots of exhibits to see. We actually went inside a cell and closed the door to see what it would feel like. The stone building was very cold, and it had open windows except for the iron bars. A very cold and damp place. This",
          "We went on a Wed. and was not busy at all. We also went to the Kilmainham jail in Dublin and I was impressed with the display of Cork city Goal much more. Very interesting and well displayed. A must see if in Cork. But please don't try to walk to it if you are not in GREAT",
          "Highly recommend visiting. Cheap entry and very informative! You can walk round the jail and see what it was like for prisoners.",
          "I visited this place with my family for a day trip. It's most amazing place to visit. Lots of history and culture present there. The place well kept. Staffs are friendly and supportive. I really recommend this place for a day trip.",
          "The life-size wax models and the audio-visual room at the end make this a memorable place to visit. We did not use the audioguide, just read aloud from the map you are given which has just the right amount of details for each stop. Very well done.",
          "This is a must see in Cork. Very interesting tour that gives a good history lesson on how criminals were treated in the 1800s through the 1920s. Good 2 hours spent.",
          "It is one of the attractions that you cannot miss.. it is very interested and you learn all the history thanks to the audio guides. If you are around August try to go then since every year they do a nice festival on the garden. Good for adults but also for families with kids",
          "Two adults and an 11yr old. Really interesting place. To get the best out of it, you have to follow the guidebook they give you. Don't be tempted to wander about randomly looking at stuff, you'll feel there's not much there. There's an audio guide if you struggle with reading,",
          "The Cork City Gaol self-guided tour is very well done. I felt like I really learned the story of the gaol while also understanding the experience of the prisoners. There were many interactive exhibits and we learned a lot. You can go through as quickly or as slowly as you like.",
          "Interesting tour to take a visitor to on a rainy day, staff are really helpful and the jail is fascinating",
          "Very interesting, very well restored attraction, Nice easy walk from Cork centre although it is up a hill so be careful if mobility an issue. Very well kept grounds. A cafe would be an improvement.",
          "Being in jail is never good = but it was even harder back in those days! If you got an audio guide = vivid stories will be told. The audio guide admission is \u20ac 12 ; otherwise 10 Sometimes you\u2019ll see puppets exemplify scenes told on the audio guide. There is a good interactive",
          "Absolutely fantastic, great history of prison life ,very helpful and use of knowledge available here. very clean and well restored. highly recommended",
          "If you are interested in history of Ireland, you should go tehre. Nice exhibitions can show you a mediaval life in old Ireland.",
          "Very interesting and sad history behind the Cork City Gaol. Both adults and teenagers were fascinated by it. Would highly recommend it to locals and visiting tourists",
          "We did a short circular self guided tour of recommended attractions in Cork city centre, and decided to take the 1/2 hour walk to the Gaol. Glad we did, well worth a visit, would recommend the audio tour (interesting and informative).",
          "I highly recommend visiting here! It looks like a castle but it is the old City Jail (Gaol) from the centuries past. Built to a similar plan to Kilmainham in Dublin (which you should also visit), it provides a fascinating insight into what life was like in the 1800's and",
          "Brilliant activity to do, cool to see the history of the place, very interesting place to see. You are given headphones on this tour so you can take your time looking around pause and play again when ready.",
          "Well worth a visit beautifully restored and very easy to follow with a well crafted storyline via the leaflet",
          "The jail is well maintained and definitely gives you an idea of what it would have been like to be an inmate or guard there. Although the punishments and conditions were appalling, especially early on, this gaol was actually quite experimental and progressive for its time. The",
          "What an experience! The gaol is huge and we used the audio tapes. You can imagine how scared people must have been entering that Gaol. It was very hard for anyone going in there and it also housed children who were often imprisoned for stealing food as they were starving. Lots",
          "Worth a look. Interesting to hear the real stories of how people were imprisoned over 100 years ago. You can freely stroll around at your own pace.",
          "A great place to visit if you're visiting cork. Myself and my boyfriend were debating whether to visit the gaol on our last day in cork but we finally decided to go and there was no regrets, at the end of the visit we were glad we went. Very informative and interesting history.",
          "I'd recommend getting the audio guide here which is \u20ac2 extra each, it really adds to depth and interest. I was really taken in by the stories of the prisoners on the audio guide. The visit for us was complete in roughly an hour and a half and we thoroughly enjoyed every second",
          "Took a Dutch friend to visit the Gaol and we were both very impressed. I would advise paying that bit extra for the audio to take around with you as it is very informative.",
          "The old jail is very interesting and full of history. Would recommend getting the headphones so you can get further information and go around at your own pace.",
          "Went with my 6 year old and 15 year old and both enjoyed it. Very interesting place interesting history. They had a story teller there that made it for the kids. It was our rainy day trip and I can't recommend it enough. The staff are very good also. Very well set up.",

          "This place is awesome! The audio tour is really interesting and it gives you an honest and interesting insight of the history of the place. There's a lot to see here and a lot of history behind the place. I really enjoyed it and would strongly recommend for others to visit it as",
          "I love visiting jails. The buildings were very nicely preserved. However the information provided to visitors is very small. We were given a few lines on a cell or a subject. That included Countess Markieviecz. I feel like way more info should have been given on her. And I",
          "Lots of th8ngs in Cork are closed on Sundays but the prison is open 360 days a year. Take the audio tour to really understand the background of the prison - excellent presentation and grounds in the summer, I expect. Difficult to get to via public transport but nice walk along",
          "Brilliant tour with loads of info on the prisioners that inhabited the Gaol throughout the years We did a day time tour and the place had a very eery feel so I wouldn't recommend tbe night tour to anyone that spooks easily. A few stairs so comfortable shoes are suggested!!",
          "Great old building that offers a weatlh of history on it's dark past. Interesting stories to be read, enjoyed the whole building, on par with other gaol museums in the UK, worth the visit.",
          "The staff were really good and explained where we had to go and if you have any questions about the history of the building they were very happy to chat.",
          "Nice visit to the local former jail. The guide was very polite and skilled. She gave a detailed description how life in jail was like. Quite chilly, put some warm clothes on if you go there.",
          "If you wamt to experience what life was like in an Irish Prison then you have to visit Cork Gaol. You are given headphones to guide you on your visit through the attraction. At the end there is an excellently staged video presentation outlining the fate of some of the inmates.",
          "This castle-like building really gives you a sense of how was prison life in the 19th century. The radio museum upstairs is also quite interesting.",
          "Take the audio tour, if you decide to visit the \u201cGaol\u201d. We enjoyed our visit, and was worth the walk from the city center to Sunday\u2019s Well.",
          "We had an afternoon free in Cork and picked this up on tripadvisor. It was a couple of hours well spent and very informative. My advice is - take the optional extra audio tour round with you as it gives more information than the leaflet.",
          "A great visit showed how cruel we could be all those years ago . But lets remember if you dont commit the crime you dont do the pain Well reserved buliding but lacked a cafe",
          "Loved my visit here very knowledgeable staff and gives u the feel of how it was for the inmates of past - I even had a ghost encounter in one of the cells and when I went back and told the man he informed me that yes a lot of people encounter the exact same thing in that",
          "A very interesting and informative self-guided tour of this gaol. You really get the feel of what it would have been like to be incarcerated here.",
          "It is a self guided tour, well presented and the figures are kind of scary looking. The structure itself is beautiful with a lot of natural light coming in.",
          "Cork is a nice medium sized town in Southern Ireland. Traffic is a bit chaotic, but at least no issue.",
          "Well worth the visit - definitely worth the extra for the Audio tour headset. Well laid out museum that you stroll around at your own pace.",
          "As a non history fan, I found the stories and the displays interesting amd easy to folllow. There was a Halloween event which slightly disturbed us but it was definitely worth a visit. The views were also excellent and the building itself was very impressive.",
          "I went with my four children to the gaol. They loved it, great fun and great value for money. Excellent",
          "My 7 year old and I walked out to the gaol from the city centre, perched on the top of the hills over looking the city, the views were great. The staff, on arrival, were very engaging, they suggested the audio tour which I'd highly recommend as I think it made the tour. The",
          "If you want to get a feel for the history of Cork, what it was like for a large part of the population, you need to visit the City Gaol. This is a self paced self guided tour is best enjoyed by spending a couple extra \u20ac\u2018s for the audio tour; it adds a level of emotion that",
          "Fantastic historical tour of the old Cork prison during British rule. it's a magnificent building that has been kept as it once was. Very interesting and well worth a visit.",
          "A self guided audio tour was well conceived. The tour was both interesting and historically relevant. The jail commons looks more beautiful than one would imagine. Not a place anyone wanted to be - but the times were hard. Fascinating radio exhibit is also contained in the",
          "Decided on a break from geocaching and this was a fascinating historical journey. Would recommend paying a couple of Euro more for the audio tour as it doubtless enhanced the experience. Times were harsh in those days if you were poor and either hungry or drunk! Make sure you",
          "Worth a visit, we went on a Sunday morning, very welcoming staff, nice and quiet so we got to hear all the stories from the guide in depth and take our time looking around and see the history",
          "The audio guide is \u20ac2 in addition to the entry fee but it does give visitors the needed historical background to understand how inmates were incarcerated in the past. It would be better for more areas of the prison to be opened to the public such as the prison exercise grounds",
          "We visited the gaol on cool autumn day easy to park just outside and reasonably priced. Quite an impressive building and a very good audio tour which you pay 2 euro more for but well worth it as it is numbered as you move around and very informative.",
          "Take the self guided tour where you can listen about the history of the jail through headphones. Interesting characters.",
          "This historic building is a Must Visit if you are in Cork. The guided tour was both amusing and very informative. To truly understand daily life in Cork so many years ago you need to visit this place. Amazing stories and sights. Well worth the time to come visit. Bert Buckley",
          "This should not be missed if you are in Cork. The building is still intact and you can wander round and go in and out of the cells. It still has quite a chilling atmosphere.",
          "I really enjoyed the self guided tour here. It is beautifully restored and I enjoyed the history lesson afforded by the tour. It is really a great place to go to find out what it was like for prisoners in the late 19th century",
          "This is truly a very worthwile trip to make. A few minutes by bus from the city center. Inside the building has been renovated very well to give you an errie feeling of what life was like as a prisoner here. You have the option of adding an audio accompaniment to your tour but",
          "Was a very interesting informative visit and well worth the money we paid. We went for the written guide rather than headphones and it was perfect.",
          "Very interesting and enjoyable visit. Went on the guided tour, the guide was informative and made it interesting and fun with the stories of the former inmates and prison staff. Had a good few hours here and would recommend it to anyone visiting cork.",
          "As a cork native of 30 years this is the first time I\u2019ve visited the gaol. I found it to be reasonable at \u20ac25 for a family pass and they enjoyed it , The layout is good a lot to see and plenty of cells for the kids to go in and take it all in , I\u2019d recommend it to anyone",
          "We took a self guided tour of the gaol and I found it very interesting. Generally I am not very good at reading things and seem to just wander round museums and places like that but I read the guide back to back. It tells a story and informative at the same time. Place was",
          "I had passed Cork City Gaol for years without visiting, until one wet day we ventured inside. It is an excellent historic gaol, with self guided audio tour that is well worth engaging in. So good, we have visited twice. This is real history.",
          "Visited the Gaol with family and we really enjoyed a bit of banter with the staff. The staff were well informed of the history and made it interesting to visit. It is a nice venue for a quirky wedding.",
          "I visited this old Gaol during my recent visit to Cork. It is quite close to the city centre and is definitely walkable. The audio guide helps explains the history of the Gaol and the significance it played in early Cork and Irish history. Each point of interest is well marked",
          "Visited here with family. A bit pricey, \u20ac25 for family ticket, compared to some other places visited. Only a portion of the building has been renovated. They base the tour on one year and give examples of some of the storied pertaining to the inmates of that time. The tour",
          "Nice goal, the audio guide was helpful but a guided tour would have been even better as it was very short. Beware of parking as it is very limited and the surrounding streets are permit parking only and very tight",
          "Small gaol with some good info. Enough to keep children interested without being too much. Staff helpful in answering quaestions",
          "Not a great deal to see in Cork so we thought we\u2019d give this a go. The stories they give throughout are great and it\u2019s interesting to see the original cells. I thought it was much better than Dublin Gaol. Had he audio tour but the guide they give you is much better.",
          "I found the whole visit to be superb and whilst there were no tours on offer I believe that the audio tour to be both very informative and permitted you to complete your visit as fast or slow as you wish. \u20ac 8 entrance fee for an adult with a free tour brochure or an extra \u20ac 2",
          "We weren\u2019t there for a live tour guide, but did the audio tour. We both loved the tour and the Gaol was fascinating to learn about. Beautiful building with lots of history!",
          "Easy to get to from the Hop on Hop off bus great audio visual giving in insight in to Irish history, Very good guides explaining every aspect of the Gaol surprisingly not such a bad place to be during the potato famine, Upstairs there is another museum dedicated to the early",
          "Cork city gaol is a really interesting place to visit - wonderful old building with lots of information, albeit simply put across, about numerous inmates and staff members. Also chance to try out a cell! There are picnic tables located outside the entrance which were perfect",

          "This place it is impresive just from outside.You can walk for the halls and look inside some cells. You can see recreations of different scenes with the realistic dummies. Also, you can hear the autoguided which had very interesting information. You can realized how different",
          "On our hop on hop off bus city tour we visited this Cork City Goal and thought it was well worth a visit as it demonstrates very well the type of life prisoners had to endure",
          "We did this as part of our hop on-hop off bus tour. There is an additional fee to do this and you can also get headphones and listen to a recording that gives you a further history of the site. Glad that we decided to get off here and learn more about Irish history.",
          "Really worthwhile attraction in Cork. Within walking distance of downtown. Tour guides are humorous and knowledgeable about their subject matter. Really well curated displays that allow for a moderate amount of immersion into the way and rhythm of life in the gaol.",
          "Went here with family from the UK. Nice place with friendly staff. Price isnt good or bad, great history of cork.",
          "Learn about poverty and mans inhumanity to man. A moving experience which is really well done and a very good audio/visual experience to end. Quite a trek for a pedestrian - uphill from the city centre.",
          "My family and I visited Cork Gaol last week whilst on holiday. Three of us have visited before but it was just as interesting the second time around. We decided to take the guided tour this time. Our guide Craig was great, very friendly and knowledgeable. He gave us a great",
          "My friend & I just walked around ourselves using the free written tour. It was informative & interesting. You can walk around the main part of the gaol & go into cells, where they have recreations of gaol scenes using dummies, with the stories being told in the written guide.",
          "I didn\u2019t know what to expect, so I was surprised by this nice museum. Especially for teens and older children is this a good museum.",

          "This Gaol is interesting in terms of showing the history of the city, and the social / religious conditions at the time. It is relatively easy to get about the entire Gaol, and is a quick enough tour. We did the free guided tour - it definitely helped having the guide with us,",

          "Victorian prison with an extensive audio tour in several languages that leaves an impression. Highly worth visiting for the architecture and history. Lovely small cafe too for a coffee!",
          "This was our second visit to the gaol with our two young sons. The gaol is very well done and it really captures the sentiment of what life was like in the gaol. We didn't do the tour but there was one on at the time we were there and the guide was excellent. I would definitely",
          "Visited the gaol today not expecting much but left over the moon after my experience. We had a brilliant tour guide, Julian, very animated and full of enthusiasm. We learned so much more than we could have imagined to and even had some laughs. His tour was worth every penny and",
          "We walked here from downtown as it isn't easy to get to via transit & a little hard to find! Lovely views on the way as it's way up on a hill. It wasn't busy, the exhibits are interactive & well done. Although you don't get to see all of it, you do get to wander much of it.",
          "Visited here with my 11 year old son and went on the tour with a couple of other people so were able to hear everything and ask loads of questions. Tour was well-paced and informative and it is a very interesting place to become acquainted with although I am not sure that I",
          "A good educational tour for children. Very well choreographed and the map was great so no guide was needed. It's slightly expensive for the short time it takes to complete tour but we still recommend.",
          "The gaol itself is a rather grim but, at one point, the building was used for radio broadcasting and now houses a substantial exhibition covering this era along with a display featuring Marconi and the development of his invention. The walk to the gaol from the city along the",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Visited with 2 kids, 5 & 2 who both were interested in the museum. History told very well. Made more interesting with mannequins and there true stories. Not too expensive. Tours and audio guides available or can go round on your own.",
          "Well worth the long walk up from the city center. Very interesting afternoon spent at Cork Gaol. I would recommend that visitors join the guided tours - it\u2019s the best way to find out the most information. Found everything fascinating and very gripping, especially the use of",
          "Great place with plenty of history. Good prices not too expensive at 8\u20ac for an adult plus a euro or two for a headphone guide. Would recommend one of these! We went on a Friday and it wasn\u2019t two busy which was nice so we could take our time and wander around.",
          "Visited here with a large party including young children. Not cheap to go in, but we wanted to try out this historical place. We had a guided tour which was worth it and the young man was very knowledgable. The information guide also had lots of information and can be taken",
          "We spent about 75 minutes here (45 tour, 30 for photos and additional rooms). We opted for the tour guide rather than the audio guides. Our guide was enthusiastic and frequently offered to answer questions. Overall, we enjoyed the tour and history of the jail.",

          "The Gaol is a little way out of the centre at the top of a moderately steep hill. The price was similarly quite steep at \u20ac8 for an adult or ~\u20ac5-7 for concessions.

          "Did the guided tour, very informative. I'm from Cork and it was great to get some of our local history. Well worth it, very interesting. Lovely little caf\u00e9 also.",
          "I really found this prison to be interesting. It does a good job at documenting how life was at the Gaol for the inmates. Unfortunately the whole prison isn't open to the general public and the exhibition is a bit on the small side. I also feel that the little radio exhibition",
          "We did the guided tour and it was well worth it. We got to learn about how the geol operated when it was open as well as a variety of the people who actually stayed there and why. Well worth the visit.",
          "We enjoyed the self guided tour. Only needed about an hour to go though it all. The architecture is impressive, and learning about how prisoners were treated was very interesting.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our guided tour of the gaol. I believe it's possible to also visit without the guided tour, but I would recommend catching a guided tour to get the most out of your experience. The tour explores not only daily life in the gaol and of the lower classes",
          "Worth attending, you can either do a tour or just walk around. The cool thing is being able to go into the cells, and the personal stories around each part. The radio museum is also very good.",
          "Walked from the train terminal to the Gaol, its a nice walk if you're fit. The old jail is a beautiful building and interesting to see how the old justice system worked in Ireland. But there wasn't that much to see or do. I wanted more. A lot of potential areas are closed",
          "A steep walk up from the main town brings you to this attractive but also imposing building in its surrounding greenery. First, just inside the entrance is the new cafe - especially handy if you have just walked the steep 40 minute climb from town in a heat wave, like we had.",
          "Really good informative tour with plenty of history and such an amazing building very impressive e indeed",
          "An impressive building with a lot of history. It was heart-breaking to hear some of the stories from our guide as to why people were locked away. As with all old historic buildings there are tales of escapes, secret tunnels and ghosts to be shared. It was nice to have the",
          "Take a step back in time and see corks penal regime and radio history. It is on th3 hop hop off bus route or you can drive walking is up hill. The Gaol is reasonably price for adults. families students. It is a guided tour or you can do it your self either way you will enjoy",
          "Impressive building. Interesting local history. But lacking in exhibits. You'd be in and out 15 mins max.",
          "It was a nice walk up to the Gaol from City Center, and a very enlightening time spent walking around, exploring the exhibits. Really quite interesting, imagining what life was like in the different eras and how awful it must've been to be imprisoned here just for stealing bread",
          "The tours of the goal really bring history to life, you feel as if you are living with the the inmates with the tales the guides tell. Would recommend to tour for all ages.",
          "Visited early July on a Friday morning arriving not long after opening and thus it was very quiet. Walked from town and it took around 15-20mins up hill but was well signposted and easy to find. Took the guided tour in a small group but you can go round on your own with a audio",
          "An interest look at the City Gaol in Cork from the early 1800s to the 1920s. This includes some interesting chapters in Irish history that are handled quite well. The video presentation is very good, but I found the audio a little echoey, making some of it hard to understand.",
          "Very easy to get to just outside the city, there is limited parking right outside the Gaol, but there are a number of side streets you can park in and it is a short walk to Fitzgerald's Park. The children where enthralled with the detail and some of the punishements handed down",
          "This is an amazing experience. A jail that tells a story of another time with authentically costumed mannequins depicting the jailed and the jailers. The admission price is quite reasonable and in fact is even a bargain. Unfortunately, guided tours are not available on a",
          "A must see. The pain and suffering in this gaol (jail) had to be unbelievable. Small unheated cells, sadistic warder's, which was most typical of the British regime of the day. The treatment of both sexes was part of an era gladly not with us any more. Although one wonders if we",
          "So much history in one place. Well worth the short bus ride and plenty to see when you arrive. A good exhibition of what life was like in this not too long ago used prison. Gift shop as you leave.",
          "I was there on a business event and it was fantastic. So unique and such a great atmosphere. Highly recommend for business events when you want something out of the ordinary.",
          "A fantastic day out for the family. A family ticket will set you back \u20ac25. Guided tours are available. Extremely interesting.",
          "I really liked this place and it was an easy and beautiful walk from downtown. My son, 7, is a wiggly boy who rarely pays attention to museums was really taken with this place and talked about it in detail later on that night over skype with his dad. Its interesting. The movie",
          "We got a tour guide instead of the self guided tour. The guide was really good, knew alot and was able to answer questions. Once the guided tour was over we were free to wander around the prison by ourselves and look at things in more detail. The cafe unfortunately had a",
          "Very affordable, interesting place! The staff are lovely and helpful! The Goal has dummies posed in cells though, so young children may be a bit afraid of them, but I certainly recommend this place and can\u2019t wait to go back!",
          "Well worth a visit, and incredibly impressive building. There was an easy to follow guide book and the Gaol was well laid out! Friendly helpful staff throughout the building. The audio visuals were well done also",
          "First of all, if you have any trepidation about driving on the narrow streets in Ireland, you may want to walk or take public transportation to this destination. We were able to take an easy walk from our hotel. While the gaol (jail) is interesting, the full-scale dioramas",
          "My wife and i saw this as we did the Hop on and Hop offf tour bus in June 2018, it was interesting to see an old Irish prison, the architecture and how they did things vs the USA. I wouldn't put this as a must see type of attraction but if your there its worth the 30-45 minutes",
          "Beautiful prison. Must use audio guide to get full experience. Took us an hour to complete. Worth it. Fantastic.",
          "Really worth a visit, its a local piece of history and has been nicely restored. Free parking outside was nice.",
          "I've been coming to Cork on and off for years and somehow never visited the gaol. Very glad I did on this occasion; very interesting and informative. Well worth the effort !",
          "We had visited the Kilmainham Gaol just a few days prior, which is such a moving experience, I did not expect to be so taken with the Cork City Gaol. The building and grounds are beautifully maintained, and the self-guided tour is absolutely amazing. A great afternoon, do not",
          "Very nice historical place. Worths a visit. Nice green area around the Gaol also where you can sit. There is a small fee to pay in order to get to the Gaol.",
          "We went here on the hop on hop off bus tour and must say it is well worth a visit.you would spend about an hour here.",
          "A great place to visit perched high up on a Cork hill. The Gaol is very well preserved and the the self guided tour is excellent. A great wealth of information and a must see when in Cork",
          "I don't want to say too much about our visit, other than we learned a lot, it was pitched at a sensible level for all age groups (we're in our 60's but there was a lot of children there, who were fully engaged) and we left deep in thought. It's quite moving and takes about an",
          "Very informative tour telling the history of the prison. Highly recommend- put on your to-do list in Cork.",
          "Learned a ton about the culture and society of Ireland's past. A must-do if anyone in your party is interested in history.",
          "Interesting displays and figures in the cork city Gaol to illustrate life in the prison. We got A map instead of audio guide but the map itself is very informative and easy to read. Even though it\u2019s a small place but we still enjoyed ourselves.",
          "First of all, I decided to walk here from the city, which was manageable for me, but if you do it, be prepared for a good 20+ minute walk half of which is uphill. That being said, the gaol and grounds is quite nice. After I walked around, I sat at one of the picnic tables and",
          "Amazing building ... stories are intriguing .... you can walk through or get guided tour....worth a visit while in cork",
          "Definitely worth checking out! I wish there was a bit more of the property we could actually access but it was a cool play to see and explore.",
          "Very interesting gaol, not super crowded when we went, so we parked right up front. No obvious big parking lots so I expect that the place is not ever that crowded. I rented headphones for the tour, three in my group did not. I think I got a bit more out of it. Several",
          "Details given through head phones. Very useful. Highly recommend a trip to this Gaol. A lot of stairs - be aware.",
          "If you are interested in history this is a must visit! Informative booklet or audio guide. you should expect min 30.",
          "A very nice place on a Sunday afternoon, 19th century prison, you can see how criminals were treated once.",
          "Very interesting historical site, well maintained. Interesting throughout, saw some historical writing from my great grandfather which wasn\u2019t aware of at the time.",
          "Really enjoyed this trip back into Cork's penal history. The exhibits are well explained with both wall labels and an excellent guide map. The cell block itself and the various cells are interesting, but the highlight for us was the section including the Cork Radio Museum and a",
          "Not overall expensive. It covers the history of 19th century prison in Ireland. Very interesting. Quite short, only took about 1.5 hours from start to finish.",
          "Learnt so much today and its really beautiful. Theres a lovely picnic area in the prison garden...wish i had brought some snacks especially after the walk up the hill to get there..top tip bring snacks and chill. Great views of the city too! Learnt a lot and really enjoyed it!",
          "If you happen to be in Cork I highly recommend that you visit this museum. It is excellent not only in the presentation, but in the preservation of the buildings. I didn't take the audio tour as I am not general a fan of audio tours. The brochure that they give you for the",
          "Reasonably priced and very interactive. Interesting and a really fun place to visit. The grounds are beautiful too.",
          "I went to the Cork City Gaol with some friends. The architecture of the building is really impressive and the cells are are equipped with wax figures. Every customer gets a paper guide with a short explanations to some personal destinies. I really appreciated this kind of guide,",
          "Been to Cork many times and this was my first visit. Very impressive tour and beautiful grounds. Worth the visit!",
          "Enjoyed visiting here on a recent trip to Cork. Found the history of the Gaol interesting and educational. Would recommend if you are in the area.",
          "Very informative information about the jail and some of its prisoners and visitors. There are factual information on walls, writing from some of the inmates cells, you get to view and go inside a cell and around main part of the building and grounds - there are some parts that",
          "What a find. Our daughters had researched places to see for our day in Cork - and the City Gaol was \u2018a must\u2019. We were not disappointed. A friendly welcome at the gatehouse - my wife chose the audio tour; I took the printed guide with a kids\u2019 Easter Bunny hunt with our children.",
          "Really interesting and informative. Enjoyed the audio tour but the self guided tour gave you good infornation",
          "This tour gave an interesting insight into 18th century Cork. Both the booklet and audio were well done. It was a shame the cafe wasn't open after our 25 minute walk up the hill. It is time well spent to see a slice of important Irish history.",
          "A twenty minutes uphill walk from the city center, you will find this fascinating slice of 18th century Cork. There is an audio guide you could get for an extra 2 Euros, but we opted to go without it. Its 8 Euros per person. There are a lot of lifelike figures in cells and some",
          "After an uphill walk to the gaol it was great to pay a visit to understand more about a slice of history in 18th century Cork. We opted for the free guidebook which gave back stories into several parts of the exhibition",
          "Amazing place. I was here for a friends wedding, and was amazed by the place. Like most people, I hadn't been here before, and I will be doing the official tour soon. I highly recommend a visit here for both locals and visitors",
          "A hidden gem for all the yanks visiting cork It\u2019s a must see for all you ex pats that come to Cork It\u2019s one of those places that carries a lot of Irish history and the guide has all the charm of an Irish story teller",
          "No the easiest place to find in Cork!! This attraction would benefit from better signposting as pretty poor from city centre! When we eventually found it were very impressed! Well laid out trail and information on the paper guide. Great way to spend a couple of hours. Impressive",
          "We visited the Old Cork Gaol which is now a museum. It is a fascinating place most of which has been well restored and very well curated. It gives a very good insight into the conditions endured by prisoners in the not too distant past. There is some very good interpretive work",
          "During a recent mini break to Cork we set of to find the Gaol. We did eventually get there despite poor signposting ! It was well worth the walk. Very informative and interesting. Staff were helpful and directed us to a local coffee shop afterwards.",
          "Spent an afternoon here, was good to see but having visited kilmainham jail dublin I would encourage you to see that instead if possible",
          "I'd lived in Cork for 4yr but never realised I could visit. On my recent return visit, I made sure I checked it out. It's a pretty interesting spot and the audio tour was very good. It had a slight feel of Kilmaimham Gaol about it, smaller though. It's definitely worth checking",
          "A little bit like Kilmainham Jail, Cork Jail is a mine of interesting history surrounding the English occupation of Ireland with the extra unexpected little gem that the building also served as the HQ for Cork local radio for many years! If you visit, id recommend getting the",
          "This is a great place to visit for adults and children. Unchanged since it closed over 45 years ago. The cells have great displays in them showing how hard life was back then. The radio museum is also good. Easy parking with great views. Well worth a visit",
          "We had a few hours to kill, so we made our way here. It\u2019s not a must see but if you have time, check it out. Very interesting history and eye opening to the struggle the country went through. Beautiful grounds, do the audio tour though, reading about it while trying to take it",
          "This was well worth visiting Seeing the cells and how prisoners spent their time A video also explained how life was here Good visit",
          "We missed the gaol in Dublin so I\u2019m very glad we stopped at this one! The tour is great fun, but I wish we did the audio tour! I always like a more guided tour, personally. The exhibits are very interesting, but what surprised me were the gorgeous views outside the jail windows!",
          "This was a really good tour, interesting history if a little creepy. Excellent audio tour. Highly recommended.",
          "As a criminal justice professor, I love to visit old prisons. This one did not disappoint. I chose the audio tour with headphones for 2 euro more, and I would say is totally worth it. It only takes about an hour but the building is well-maintained and renovated a bit to reflect",
          "This was a good tour and very interesting, easy layout with a useful audio guide. It\u2019s suitable for all ages. Would Definitely recommend. Approx a 15 min walk from the centre. They have the stocks that you can have a picture with and plenty more picture opportunities.",
          "Didn\u2019t know what to expect but they definitely did a great job on this tour. It was self-paced and had itinerary for each station. The place was kept in its original condition, minus a few of the major structural components and some cells. It was so interesting to learn about",
          "Found this very interesting and well set out. Was a little disappointed that the second floor wasn't open to the public and would have liked to hear about more characters from the time but the information that was there was good!",
          "Good for children that can focus on the info being displayed.... would recommend telling your children beforehand what to expect as the tour is adult oriented. Overall a goid way to pass a few hours",
          "Been meaning to visit here with a long time seeing as i live only 40 minutes from cork. I was not disappointed. Fantastic trip. Only thing is wrap up well in the winter months as it is quite cold. Well recommended.",
          "It's a nice tour, not too bad. You get enough information but for my opinion it was a bit too little for the price of entrance.",
          "Went here on the off chance with my husband. Absolutely LOVED it and the history behind it was amazing! Definitely worth a trip.",
          "The staff was cheery and very helpful. I liked the guide booklet and its descriptions where I could do the tour at my own pace. Everything was clearly labeled as well.",
          "Cork City Gaol is worth a visit, but you shouldnt expect too much. Honestly, it's an incredible building filled with a few puppets. I went for the leaflet as guide, not an audio guide. It was definitely enough for me. The prisoner's stories are really interesting and give you an",
          "The gaol is about 30 min walk from city centre and 20 minute walk back downhill. An excellent couple of couple hours, the head phones have numbered points that you can stop and start as you please. Informed about the history and some individual stories of who were imprisoned",
          "I visit this attraction with some colleagues from work while living in Cork. We had a great time on the tour and learned some interesting history.",
          "Don't miss this on your tour of Ireland! The beauty of this place is worth the drive to see it! I would try to get it on a tour.!",
          "We walked from the city centre and it proved to be a longer walk than we thought, uphill! It was interesting to see the inside of the gaol and the cells where people were kept. Young boys were flogged and thrown into gaol for minor offences. Women were gaoled for trifling",
          "My boyfriend and I visited the Gaol while on a city break to court. It was very interesting with a well organised exhibition with numbered exhibits and a map. I would definitely recommend. Just one tip if you're coming here in winter wrap up warm as there is zero heating, I",
          "My class group and i attended here last friday and had a tour of the gaol we were shown around by Orla we cant compliment her enough she was just fantastic and was very knowledgeable and clearly delivered the information on the history behind the gaol . She had no problem",
          "A very informative way to pass an hour or 2. On entry you get a map or you can get an audio guide for an extra \u20ac2 each. It's well laid out with each exhibit numbered and explained. It's sad to see how badly treated the poverty stricken were treated, and what the conditions were",
          "We got a taxi there at 11am and arranged to be picked up at 1pm. This was a mistake as we could have spent much longer there to do it justice. We had a tour guide while there, and can be booked at no extra cost for a large group. Audio aids are provided if visiting on your own.",
          "Very enjoyable for all visitors to cork . Good interface with guided tours and audio visual aids as you go through in many languages",
          "I would like to say the building is beautiful (although it feels wrong to say this due to the amount of suffering that occurred here). We pretty much had the place to ourselves which was lovely as we could really take our time and appreciate the architecture. You are given a",
          "They have excellent guides and some well placed and thoughtful exhibits throughout the gaol. It's a very interesting place to visit and the people who work there are very friendly and helpful. It's a surprisingly beautiful building for such a sad and morbid pastand really allows",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you like history and fort-like buildings. Nicely prepared exhibition gives a real feeling of a prisoner\u2019s life in the past centuries.",
          "A must do on your trip to Cork. You will get the feel of the good the bad and the ugly of Corks past. Great tour guides and the prison is fantastic that you can wander round yourself if you wish. Keep and eye out for the special events. There is a Halloween party and music",
          "Thank you to the staff for being so wonderful and informative when I came to the history of Cork city Gaol, it was one of my favorite places to go when I stayed in Cork while I attended University Cork college. I will recommend this place to anyone that I know that is going to",
          "We visited here later in the day on a Thursday at the end of November. There was hardly anyone else there which was nice as it meant we could take our time. At \u20ac8 each I feel it was reasonably priced. We didn't spend too long there as it was too cold to be outside for too long",
          "Very interesting with lots of great information and stories that help you connect with the past. Without the audio tour (which costs extra) it would have been a lot less informative because there are little signs to read to get information from. They do offer the audio in",
          "This us well worth a visit. One if the most interesting abd moving places I have ever visited. Make sure you watch the video at the end of the visit - you cannot fail to be moved - I left I tears. I will revisit when next in Ireland.",
          "Not usually one for this type of tour, but found this very interesting. I definitely recommend you take the guided tour with the headphones - a lot of detail has gone into the narrative which helps you to visualize the scenes as they are described.",
          "we took a group tour and it was well worth it. A real eye opener to the hardships if past years. The tour itself was about an hour or so.",
          "High quality tourist experience. Well illustrated. Personable examples of what it was like for the impoverished Irish under British rule. Kids under six were afraid",
          "The individual audio guide was easy to use and explained all the aspects of this fascinating gaol. The view of the city was impressive.",
          "great place to visit for history in cork city centre, interactive with audio guides, popular for kids school tours, annies restaurant nearby is good place to go after",
          "A great way to spend a hour or two learning about the Gaol. A little overpriced but the staff are lovely. You can opt for an audio guide but we were happy with the map",
          "We visited Cork Gaol for Halloween with the little ones (a 3-year-old and a 19month old) and had a great time. There was a special event on for Halloween which included face painting, balloon making and a black cat treasure map activity to keep them amused and occupied. Have to",
          "Excellent. Informative, well organised, good value. Child friendly. About adequate time for tour. Would recommend it to friends and family",
          "Sarah and her fantastic team helped transform the Gaol into a beautiful venue for our wedding ceremony. Sarah was a pleasure to deal with and was so facilitating about everything. She made everything flow so well on the day. Having ushers for the guests etc. Previous to our",
          "This place is fabulous. First of all, you get very original ticket plus leaflet. You can't get lost coz numbers will tell you what's next. Every cell is so interesting, you can read about history and you can feel like an inmate yourself. I loved it!",
          "A good insight to the awful conditions and interesting to see the cells. A quick visit so felt a little overpriced.",
          "Why a fab place to visit. Very neatly laid out, map is a treat to follow. Lots of information, but kept to a minimum so it\u2019s not too boring. Perfect for ages 6 and above, anything lower I think would find it hard to follow and understand. Really enjoyed it.",
          "We spent some time there last Sunday and we were so impressed with the story of the place and the experience. The audio tour is really well done and takes you right back to the era. You need a good 2 hours to see and listen to everything. You can take your time and repeat any",
          "Its not very crowded so you have time to enjoy each story and to observe everything around you. I got the option with audioguide for 2 euros more and don't regret, it even tells you which room to go first so you dont miss out on anything. If you are going with older people,",
          "Typical Ireland and the heavens hadn't stopped opening so we decided to head for some inside entertainment at the Gaol. From our location in the City centre we used the City Cork Tours Bus to travel around as it stops right outside the Gaol other public transport involves some",
          "It's a tour around the jail that gives you stories of people that stayed here and the history of the place. There is no guide you just walk at your own pace. For around 8\u20ac to get in it wasn't bad especially as it wasn't very busy or crowded. People tend to spend an hour",
          "The Gaol is a very intresting trip and a must do if ever in cork for a holiday, the audio guided tour was brillaint and well worth the extra money. will definitly return at some point",
          "Perfect town to chill in ... not too big neither too small. .. with many great pubs where you can listen to traditional Irish music.",
          "We toured the Cork Gaol last week and loved it! My husband and I are former prison employees in the US and still love to see historical prisons around the world. Very interesting and well done.",
          "I didn't think touring an old jail would be interesting but it was. History buffs will read and see terrible conditions in which prisoners lived, even women and children.",
          "A little piece of history preserved for your perusal well worth a visit if you like to see the more unusual sights",
          "Really interesting exhibition made all the more accessible by the 2\u20ac audio guide. Tourist information booklet give money off for couples so get this if you can. At end of tour sit and watch a well produced audi visual display and don't miss the history of radio upstairs. Did you",
          "Picked a nice day to visit. \u20ac8 to get in and I had an audio tour. Very interesting and life like. Met a lady here who it turned out only lived 30 miles from me in the UK! The building isocely and has a gift shop.",
          "When visiting Cork City to get here plenty of options are available there is a bus that tours the city and it stops at this historical site you would only b 10min walk to the City Centre other reviews are available",
          "Took my 15 and 10 year olds to visit on a dull damp day in Cork. entry price was very reasonable and the head phones to give direction was a great idea. Staff were very knowledgeable. layout and historical detail was impressive. restoration work is on-going but the bits",
          "We decided to wander into town and have a wander around the Gaol, we had been to Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin and enjoyed that, so we arrived and decided to go for the audio tour for a extra \u20ac2 it was worth the money and we were the first in on the sunday and enjoyed liserning to",
          "It costs \u20ac8 (adult) and an extra \u20ac2 to get the audio tour. The audio tour is definitely worth it. Stories of prisoners were told and they had sound effects in the background adding to the eeriness of being in a gaol. Once you finished the audio tour you could continue past the",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect but having read the reviews and having a keen interest in Irish history 1913-1923 then I knew I wanted to visit Paid \u20ac8 for entrance and guide and set off The way they have set the gaol up is fantastic, easy to follow guide and great descriptions of",
          "Interesting, sure. My wife and I, with two audio guides 20 Euros. If we had kids to take along might have been more interesting. I think we spent less than an hour there. If anyone of note was confined there, I cant recall. The wax work figures look realistic. We were",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the visit, the building is very well preserved and retains it's character beautifully. Audioguides were only \u20ac2 each and definitely worth it. You can so easily imagine the prisoners and the wardens, the place is really bought to life. The building is about as",
          "I visited the Cork City Gaol sometimes on weekend. Absolutelly historical place, saved some artefacts, installation renew the events a of old times. The guideline is available. Better to walk uphead. Not sure the buses are going directly to the place.",
          "This is a visit I would recommend for everyone . It is a very wellorganised tour of the old gaol. Headphones are used to give an excellent and very interesting history of the place . The place is very well looked after and you can feel the place is full of atmosphere that",
          "The audio tour (2 \u20ac additional to admit) helped bring the Gaol to life, although the handout (no additional cost) had some of the same material. We were led through the Gaol with 26 numbered stops along the way offering the history of the Gaol, the life stories of some of the",

          "We did the audio tour for an extra 2 Euros and it was worth it. Not only do you get the history you also get stories of people who spent time there - men, women and children - some for whom their only crime was being born poor. It was sad and fascinating and worth the stop to",
          "Went for a a conference dinner having been there 5 years previously. Its has been kept in its original state (with the addition of glass in the windows!) and is very atmospheric as a dinner venue. The food was OK - bit too much potato (but could be considered authentic",

          "We visited the Gaol for a day out on a rainy day. It was a very educational tour and nice place to visit. It is worth paying the slight extra charge to get the audio tour as opposed to just the guide book tour. If you take your own earphones you can share one of the device like",
          "Very historical and interesting and the tour guide was great. Lots of info on the gaol too which. Well worth visiting but its a little out of the city so if you don\u2019t like a long walk get a cab its about 8euro the cab fare.",
          "Gives a feel of what being jailed was like in the past. Life was very harsh for the poor. Good informative displays, worth seeing and spending sometimes.",
          "I went by myself as I was exploring cork and it is so educational to go to. It is quite small but so informative about corks and Ireland's history, you have to pay for entry but you get an audio tour and booklet to guide you. The grounds and overall appearance is stunning.",
          "Went here on holiday and was very well pleased with what we saw and experienced. Take the audio tour. It's the best. Well worth the 2euro extra",
          "Do not believe the map, from downtown it is 6 kilometres up hill. Do not let that stop you it is worth while.",
          "From the outside this looks like a country house. Inside, the history comes to life by the excellent audio and layout. A very thought provoking place, especially if you are of Irish descent. I wonder how many of my ancestors darkened the doors. My only negative is that there",
          "Worth a visit to see how prisoners were treated in the past. There is an audio tour or you can just take a tour leaflet and read about various items of interest. You go at your own pace and the route around the exhibits is easily navigated. The gaol also contains the Irish Radio",
          "We did an audio tour and found it to be a very interesting place to visit. We walked here from our hotel and it was a lovely walk. It was a place worth visiting.",
          "Allowed people to explore at their own pace. Would have been a very scary place. Happy not to have seen the tread mill at work. Must have been awful when executions were happening. Captured the times perfectly. Worth a visit",
          "I visited Cork City Gaol on 30 August 2017. Located in a nice area close to the UCC campus and not far from the Franciscan Well Brewery, the jail is one of the city's treasures. Tickets are very cheap, and visitors may choose to visit with an audioguide, or else take part in a",

          "We really liked Cork City Gaol. Our guide, Shane, was lovely - so informative and nice with the children. Would really recommend doing a tour to really appreciate the Gaol.",
          "This is an amazing building. Saved and renovated to a high standard by a local family from vegetation growing through the roofs. It is immaculately kept clean and with display models throughout it really gives the feel of what it was like to be imprisoned back in the early",
          "The place is really educational. Some areas are not accessible due to structural and safety issues. It was worth taking the guided tour where you could ask questions. After the tour, we walked around on our own to see some of the other exhibits. If more donations are acquired,",
          "I have visited a few Gaol's in England and Ireland and so this review is in comparison to other tours I have had. The Gaol is a good place to visit and it is worth having a tour as it is free of charge after the entrance fee. However I didn't feel as though the Gaol was",
          "I would recommend taking a guided tour as it is free and gives you a lot more information than if you just walk around by yourself. Definitely worth a visit as there is a lot of information about Cork and its history.",
          "After reading other reviews, we did the audio tour and really enjoyed the experience. They've done a nice job of taking you through the jail by following the stories of several prisoners. It was informative and entertaining. The jail has modern bathroom facilities and is an easy",
          "We had a guided tour and it was very interesting. The gaol focused on a particular year and talked about the people that was imprisoned at that time which made it more personal. We would recommend to visit this place.",

          "We stopped by the jail for a tour, it was 25 Euro for 2 adults and 3 kids (you can get up to 4 kids in for this price). We went for the guided tour, included in the price. You have the option to tour the jail yourself, with a descriptive map or a an audio tour for 2 Euro more.",
          "The guided tour by Shane was informative. Stories were interesting to hear about past inmates. Lots of school aged kids on our tour were entertained. Toilets available. Admission price was fair. I would recommend.",

          "A really interesting and dofferent attraction. We took the guided tour which was excellent value for money. Our guide was interesting and full of quirky facts about the history of the gaol. Would recommend a visit here.",
          "I like the jail I've been a couple of times now it's an interesting insight to what it used to be like in there. I'd love if it was developed further as I feel there is definately potential for even more",
          "Took a tour on 17th August while on holidays around cork/Kerry. Booked online but was required to provide proof of purchase on arrival. Had no access to email which meant I couldn't provide evidence. The girl at the desk checked with her manager and 10 mins later our purchase",
          "The gaol has some good replicas of people who spent time in the gaol and their stories, bringing it all to life. The tour was included in the entry price and was worthwhile. The guide was entertaining and informative. There are some displays as well. I was interested to hear",
          "Had a good time taking the kids. Didn't think there would be much but was very impressed and it made a good afternoon out. We didn't get a tour guide as with young children thought probably best to go with the flow!",
          "We took the guided tour and this was a good choice. The guide explained many different aspects of the goal and I learned a lot. There was the history of the gaol itself along with some very personal stories about some of the inmates. It was great to see the cells and the actual",
          "Great place to visit, I have bring twice and I loved it both times. The only down side is you only get to see the newer part of the jail, I would of loved to see the older cells but they are blocked off and in a bad state but apart from that this place is defo worth a visit.",
          "As others have said, it is not the easiest place to get to by foot. I suspect Cork City does not expect people to walk their either, as there weren't many signposts for pedestrians to lead there. The museum itself is impressive and I thought the way they presented the stories of",
          "We spent a fascinating couple of hours at the Cork City Gaol. \u20ac25 for a family of 5 was great value and we had a hugely interesting tour for which we luckily dropped in just at the right time. David was our tour guide and did a great job of it. Definitely worth a visit for an",

          "Interesting tour of Cork City Gaol. Guided tour was very informative, leaving you to complete tour of exhibitions afterwards.",

          "We very much enjoyed our guided tour of the jail which gave a great insight into the conditions endured by prisoners of the time A fascinating place to wander around. Also enjoyed the (new?) cafe on the upper floor of the gatehouse. The hop on hop off bus stops outslde but we",
          "The Gaol has a nice self guided tour, very informative, lets you go at your own pace. Staff friendly. I think we spent about an hour here at the most, we walked from our hotel, long walk but a nice walk through some gardens.",
          "Been to a few but this was the best done the guided tour a little bit of Irish history. Nothing like it on. A rainy afternoon in cork",
          "A very interesting place to go . this place gives you a sense of the hardships that the people had to go through when it was open as a prison. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. I went early in the morning (around 10.00) had the place to myself (nearly)had plenty of time",
          "The gaol is well presented, excellently organised and sign posted with good guide information. The staff are helpful and the price is normal. An experience that interested the adult and the child, definitely recommended.",
          "Like most tourists for the first time in a city we consulted tour books, brochures, etc and the route of the Hop On/Hop Off bus. Looked like the gaol was a good place to visit and it most certainly was. Upon arrival, we purchased a ticket and were told that in about fifteen",
          "Fabulous building Wonderfully restored Terrible and sadistic but great that the victims' stories are told A must visit",
          "Brought two young children and their parents. It was very instructive to the older 12 year old. The other child might not have taken it all in. Parents - both teachers - really enjoyed.",
          "This attraction greatly surprised me. We had done a few tours this same day and the thoughts of walking around another one wasn't appealing to me. When we walked in and saw a bland reception desk I nearly turned back around. But i am so glad I continued on. It really surprised",
          "Very interesting and uncommon place to visit. You can get a map with descriptions of every place - but it is not boring, quite opposite with humour. Every cell has its story. I really recommend it.",
          "The tour guide was well informed of the Gaol's history and kept the tour interesting. Also, you were able to enter some of the jail cell chambers which made it feel more real.",
          "Very good and well worth a visit.... our tour guide Trevor was very knowledgeable and delivered the tour very well and added a little humour which was nice Not a lot to do other than a quick walk around after the tour ends but definatley glad we took the time to go",
          "Myself and my wife took my family to visit the Gaol and had a great day..Our guide Trevor was extremely helpful, informative with a few good old joked thrown in for good measure. Our visit was a real eye opener and my kids loved the stories and close encounters with the models",
          "An enjoyable day out, very informative and interesting. Tour guide Trevor was engaging and funny making the visit all the more pleasurable for out group that consisted of a range of ages :)",
          "Amazing history surrounding this gaol. The staff were very friendly and informative. I enjoyed that they didn't just focus on famous prisoners. Great stories lie behind every corner. I particularly enjoyed the secret tunnel leading out of the gaol!!",
          "The jail or gaol is a fascinating place to visit. The grounds are beautiful and if you can, get a tour of the inside. Great trip that will take about half the day.",
          "I love the writing on the walls and the stories they tell. I can't imagine being a small child having to live in here and get whipped daily.",
          "Our guide knew a great amount of detail and the staff were helpful when one of our party was indisposed.",

          "Brought tickets online and was a bit concerned as only had pay pal confirmation. But after email to the gaol I got a quick response from Fiona reassuring me just to show the PayPal email for entry. What a fabulous visit. So much to see, about the lives of the inmates at Cork's",
          "Recommended to use the hop on hop off bus to get there because it is a little bit out of the way but totally worth it. The guided tour is recommended becaue you get much more information that you would just simply walking around the jail. The Cork Gaol has a rich history.",
          "Our visit to Cork City Gaol was interesting. Took us around 20 minutes by foot to get there from the city center but you can reach it by car or by using the Cork City Hop on Hop off Tour Bus. In the premises of the building there are at least two tables and benches for those",
          "Tickets to the gaol were included with our hotel package and we were glad to have used them. We enjoyed the walk up there, passing through various streets and getting more of a feel for the city then just staying down in the centre. We opted for the guided tour and it was",
          "This really should be on your \"to do\" list. Gives a very interesting insight into Cork's social history, tucked away up a hill outside city centre, which can be reached by foot but best by car. (Bike will have to assault a pretty decent sized hill) At 8 Euro in for an adult,",
          "Nice easy activity for a family. My husband and I went, it was educational and interesting. I especially loved the graffiti of former prisoners on the jail cell walls. It was an enjoyable experience but if my time in Ireland were limited I would skip it. Ireland has sooo much",
          "We visited Cork gaol recently. Apart from the splendour of the building itself, what really made the trip worthwhile was the guided tour. It's well worth taking the scenic walk to the edge of town to visit this gaol.",
          "It was a cold and wet day when we visited the Gaol, but enjoyed the experience and the stories. An interesting view into a dark past.",
          "Good times here. I recommend the guided tour. Our guide was informative and fun. I enjoyed looking around, and the tour was well priced.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon here! It's good value for money, very informative & our tourguide was brilliant. I would recommend this for anyone visiting cork.",
          "Easy drive up the hill from the university. They were closing early for an event so we were hurried through. Mannequins are creepy and realistic. Nice discussion of politics and conditions of prisoners. The multimedia show at the end is a little long but very interesting.",
          "As most reviews say, this is really quite interesting as an unusual view of Irish life. The short video at the end is nicely done. We arrived at end of day (4:30 pm), and missed the last guided tour (3:30). The self-guided map tour was fine (audio is basically the same thing),",
          "Really enjoyed this tour of the old city jail.. great guided tour! All ages catered for, visiting Cork? This tour is a must.. Choice of a guide or explore the jail on your own, you will enjoy this tour for sure! Great views of the city from the hill on which this jail stands.",
          "Bit of a walk up from the city but worth it. So much history here that has been brilliantly preserved. Wouldn't be the usual day out but was very enjoyable regardless. Outdoor areas are beautifully kept and lovely to catch some rays after being 'locked up' :)",
          "We visited the jail after reading the positive reviews on TripAdvisor, and were quite disappointed. The mannequins were well done but old and needed some upkeep. We got the audio guides and not sure what there would have been on the tour without them. The first set of headphones",
          "I did find the visit interesting and the attraction well set up, but I personally found it uncomfortable, I do understand that others would think differently. Lots of information I had difficulty hearing the audio visual",
          "We paid the 2euro extra to have the audio guide, and think it was well worth it. Displays were good and told the story of prisoner life well. We spent a couple of hours there and enjoyed it.",
          "Hi there, We went on Sunday 25/06 and it was well worth it. We all learnt about the prisoners and their punishments. The wax statues are like alive. The audio visual was very interesting. I would recommend it for all ages. The family of four is \u20ac25. The cafe doesn't accept",
          "Good audio tour. Helpful knowledgeable staff. Walk-able from downtown area. Radio museum / Marconi exhibit on upper floor is also worthwhile.",
          "You will find out how prisoners lived in the Cork City Gaol (a jail) in the 19th century, what crimes they committed and why the jail had to be closed down. This tour is self guided, which is a bit of a shame because I really think that it could be better if it were a guided",
          "Well designed museum. Offers insight into the hard life of a prisoner. You can either take an audio tour for an additional 2 Euro or the self guided tour with a paper brochure.",
          "when you walk in you feel the pain of the prisoners .the tour guide was very informative and answered all the questions to see the size of the cells is very sad .it is not just history but a lesson on reforms needed.",
          "It was advertised as being the place to visit and having been there now I quite agree. We paid an extra 2 euros each and had the audio guide which is definitely worth having. It definitely is well worth a visit.",
          "Worth seeing when in Cork. We visited it a few weeks after Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin. Expected a similar experience but no. This one is less about history and more about people and their fates before, during and after being imprisoned. This place is less depressing and has",
          "Would recommend getting the audio guide. Gave you tons of information! Interesting to see how jails use to be",
          "Very well organised attraction. Choice of either audio guide or written guide. Interesting insight into old penal system and the Easter Uprising.",
          "Well worth visiting. Audio tour very informative. Some of the cells had wax figures that were named and some of their stories given which made the place come alive.",
          "We visited the Cork City Gaol this morning and it was a nice experience. The building is well maintained as well as the grounds. The staff were very helpful in showing us where to go. We did complete the whole exhibit in 45 minutes which was a bit quicker than I had thought.",
          "Great day out you can catch the tour bus they drop you outside.This is an old gaol lots of history and stories",
          "Went here recently and what a good way to spend a few hours.The City Sightseeing bus stops here so its a good way to travel.The gaol has been preserved in its original structure with a very authentic look.There is so much to see so give yourself plenty of time because it is so",
          "This is one of those historical attractions that you will know ahead of time whether you are interested. This is an old gaol (Jail) that has some interesting history. The grounds look very nice and the staff is courteous and enthusiastic. The place isn't huge and the tour is",
          "Great place well worth the visit. You can get a tour bus but we walked it. Took about 30/40 minutes from our hotel Jury's Inn but we saw things of interest on the way. It is a self guided tour with handsets but very informative and can be taken at your own pace. Very",

          "This Gaol tells the story of it's prisoner's very well. Tour is self guided. You get a map and guide book explaining all aspects of the gaol and its prisoners. Makes you very appreciative to live in present times. Very small gift shop. Cool place to explore.",
          "Cork City Gaol exceeded our expectations. The show is excellently set up and you leave the place with so much more knowledge of the history of Ireland's politics.",
          "it was really great and beautiful to see i will highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city...great part of history and u learn a lot..",
          "Didn't really like Cork but this was the highlight. It showed off Victorian as well as Irish history (the design is similar to those in the UK (Victorian era), the wax characters brought it to life, great for a history buff but also for everyone that likes old houses as this one",
          "Very interesting site, well worth a visit and take the audio tour option, it really makes the place come alive. Very well restored section open to the public (lots of the wings are still derelict) and makes you realise the poor conditions that prisoners once had to endure -",
          "So much history to see here. Very informative and well laid out and kept. Very well done exhibit without being overdone.",
          "This was my first time in an old prison and I must say it was worth the trip. We opted for the audio guide (via headset) as recommended by another traveler, which was very informative. Definitely worth the upgrade as it provided much more information. Make sure to keep your eye",
          "I loved it! Will take about 30 minutes to complete. Was not overcrowded which was wonderful. I found it very nice to do besides walking around Cork. Definitely watch the video they play in one room",
          "We decided to try and squeeze this in after spending a good amount of the day at Blarney Castle and I'm so glad we did! It was such an interesting look into the history of Cork and Ireland. I would suggest the audio tour or having one of the employees do a tour because you learn",
          "This was a fun site to go to. There was a lot of history and it was presented in a way that wasn't just reading off of a sign post. We really enjoyed the stories and walk through of the old jail. Would definitely recommend for adults as well, but older children may enjoy this",

          "I've lived in Cork all my life and never visited the Gaol til this year, and it was the most amazing experience. I brought my kids, as it was the halloween fun day, which they really enjoyed, but I kind of wish that I had been on my own, to \u2026",

          "A really interesting place to visit. The staff were helpful and the information was presented in a very interesting way, via the various stories of past inmates. We visited on a very wet day and we're glad of the indoor aspect. Ideal for a rainy morning in Cork.",
          "A little bit expensive from my point of view but totally worth to spend a couple of hours.\n\nBecause it is stone-made, it is really cold in the inside. Anyone would enjoy and learn a lot with the story of the characters.",

          "We took the tour and it was great. Lots of interesting history and information.",
          "Really good experience, I've been here twice once with a guided tour and once we were free to roam. Either way it's very interesting and informative. Really gives an insight into life at the prison. Would recommend to anyone travelling through Cork.",
          "Interesting place to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Cool and educational place. And yes, cool- bring a jacket, it\u2019s colder inside than outside somehow. Cute gift shop too",

          "The Cork City Gaol Museum is an unexpected pleasure for most modern city-dwellers that are used to \"Human Rights\" and personal choices.\n\nOn a limited budget, I'm sure, the Museum has been able to give the visitor a snapshot into the past \u2026",
          "Really interesting and well worth a visit!! Amazing building!",
          "Way too expensive for what's on offer. Sure it's cool for about 20mins. Hardly  worth 10euro entry",
          "An almost two hundred year old Georgian jail (gaol) restored and maintained well. There's a good sample of stories from both poor and political inmates, and a few games suitable to older children to help them learn. There's a good dramatic \u2026",

          "8 euros per person is a bit steep for this walk-through tour. 2 euros extra for audio tour. Two people that over $20 USD. Need to request volunteers to do reenactment especially during the weekends what is like to be in the prison. This could be so much better if they just give it some thoughts from a tourist perspective.",
          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Cork for the first time or even if you have lived in Cork all your life and haven't yet paid a visit to the gaol. The building is teeming with history, including graffiti etched on prison cell walls by \u2026",
          "Amazing piece of history, a must visit",
          "Very interesting place. There is a large amount of the original gaol that remains completely untouched, which is fascinating. Then there is also the museum/tour area which is very well put together. The tour focuses on the lives of prisoners in a very interesting and engaging way.",

          "Excellent exhibition, gives you a good insight into 19th century social history. Very lively due to life-size puppets, visual and sound effects. It pays out to take the audioguide, too!",

          "Bery informative full of different  periods  of history",
          "Well preserved 19th century prison. The tour is well laid out and gives you a excellent idea  of the conditions the prisoners experienced and typical stories. You will probably spend an hour on the visit. Staff helpful and friendly.",

          "The was interesting experience in prison see how it was before.",

But what I like the most is the architecture of this building.\n\nWhen the prison opened in the 1820 s it housed both male and female prisoners, whose crimes were committed within the city boundary. Anyone committing a crime outside that boundary were committed to the County Gaol, across the river from the City Gaol",

The cathedral is located on the south side of the River Lee, on ground that has been a place of worship since the 7th century, and is dedicated to Finbarr of Cork, patron saint of the city. It was once in the Diocese of Cork; it is now one of the three cathedrals in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin.\nChristian use of the site dates back to a 7th-century AD monastery, which according to legend was founded by Finbarr of Cork. The original building survived until the 12th century, by when it had either fallen into disuse or been destroyed by the Normans. Around 1536, during the Protestant Reformation, the cathedral became part of the established church, later known as the Church of Ireland. The previous building was constructed in the 1730s, but was widely regarded as plain and featureless.\nThe cathedral's demolition and rebuild was commissioned in the mid-19th century by an Anglican church intent on strengthening its hand after the reforms of penal law. Work began in 1863, and resulted in the first major commissioned project for the Victorian architect William Burges, who designed most of the cathedral's architecture, sculpture, stained glass, mosaics and interior furniture. Saint Fin Barre's foundation stone was laid in 1865. The cathedral was consecrated in 1870 and the limestone spires completed by October 1879.\nThe cathedral is mostly built from local stone sourced from Little Island and Fermoy. The exterior is capped by three spires: two on the west front and above where the transept crosses the nave. Many of the external sculptures, including the gargoyles, were modelled by Thomas Nicholls. The entrances contain the figures of over a dozen biblical figures, capped by a tympanum showing a Resurrection scene.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Finbarr of Cork ===\n\nThe church grounds are located south of the River Lee on Holy Island, on one of the many inlets forming the Great Marsh of Munster (Corcach Mor na Mumhan). Saint Fin Barre's is on the site of at least two previous church buildings, each dedicated to Fin Barre of Cork, patron saint of Cork city, and the founder of the monastic hermitage at Gougane Barra.Finbarr was born in about 550. He was, by legend, given Gougane Barra as a place of contemplation, and visited Cork city to lay the foundation stones for the \"one true Christian faith\". By legend, after Finbarr died his remains were brought to Cork to be enclosed in a shrine located on the site of today's cathedral.Archaeological evidence suggests the first site at Fin Barre's probably dates from the 7th century, and consisted of a church and round tower which survived until the 12th century, after which it fell into neglect, or was destroyed during the Norman invasions.\n\n\n=== Medieval and 18th-century churches ===\n\nA 1644 reference to the site notes that \"in one of the suburbs of Korq [Cork] there is an old tower ten or twelve feet [3.3 m] in circumference, and more than one hundred feet [30 m] high ... believ[ed] to have been built by St. Baril [Finbarr]\". The building was badly damaged in 1690 during the Siege of Cork, after which only the steeple remained intact, due to an outbreak of fire and the impact of a 24-pound (11 kg) shot from Elizabeth Fort in nearby Barrack Street. The cannonball was rediscovered during the 1865 demolition and is now on display in the cathedral. The church was demolished in 1735 and replaced the same year by a smaller building, as part of a wider phase of citywide construction and renovation.Only the earlier spire was retained for the new building. The older part of this church was described in 1862 as Doric in style, attached to a featureless modern tower with an \"ill-formed\" spire. The building was widely considered to be poorly designed. The Dublin Builder described it as \"a shabby apology for a cathedral which has long disgraced Cork\", while The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland judged it \"a plain, massive, dull, tasteless, oblong pile, totally destitute of what is usually regarded as cathedral character, and possessing hardly a claim to any sort of architectural consideration\". It was demolished in 1865.\n\n\n=== 19th-century building ===\nIn April 1862, the Church of Ireland, in pursuit of a larger, more attractive cathedral, and determined to reassert its authority in response to a resurgent Catholicism, initiated a competition for a replacement building, which became the commission for the first cathedral to be built in the British Isles since London's St Paul's. The following February, the designs of the architect William Burges, then 35, were declared the winner of the competition to build the new cathedral. Burges disregarded the \u00a315,000 budget, and produced a design that he estimated would cost twice as much. Despite the protestations of fellow competitors, it won. His diary records his reaction \u2013 \"Got Cork!\" \u2013 while cathedral accounts mention a payment of \u00a3100 as prize money. The foundation stone was laid on 12 January 1865, the unfinished cathedral was consecrated in 1870, and the spires topped out in 1879.\n\nBurges used a number of his earlier unrealised designs for the exterior, including those intended for the Crimea Memorial Church, Istanbul, St John's Cathedral, Brisbane and elevations for Lille Cathedral. The main obstacle was economics. Despite the efforts of fundraisers, Cork was unable to afford a large cathedral. Burges partially alleviated this by designing a three-spired exterior which enhanced the size of the building to viewers. He realised early on the build would vastly exceed the money the city had raised.The superiority of his design was recognised by the Bishop of Cork, John Gregg, who supported Burges and lobbied for additional funding. Gregg was instrumental in sourcing additional money, including local merchants such as William Crawford of the Crawford brewing family and Francis Wise, a local distiller. The final total was significantly over \u00a3100,000. Burges, assured by the efforts of Gregg, was unconcerned. Gregg died before the completion of the project. In his place, his son Robert continued his father's support, and in 1879 ceremoniously placed the final stone on the eastern spire. By then the contractors estimated that the build was nearing its completion, with only a number of pre-designed stained glass fittings left to be installed.\n\nThe cathedral holds the book of estimates prepared for the decoration of the west front. Nicholls was paid \u00a31,769 for the modelling, and Robert McLeod \u00a35,153 for the carving. Burges took 10 per cent for the design, more than his usual 5 per cent, apparently due to his high level of personal involvement. Its construction took seven years before the first service was held in 1870. During the first building phase, three firms of contractors were employed, owned by, chronologically, Robert Walker, Gilbert Cockburn and John Delany who eventually completed the construction of the spires in 1879. Building, carving and decoration continued into the 20th century, long after Burges' death in 1881, including the marble panelling of the aisles, the installation of the reredos and side choir walls, and the 1915 construction of the chapter house.Saint Fin Barre's is described by the architectural historians David Lawrence and Ann Wilson as \"undoubtedly [Burges'] greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture\", with an interior that is \"overwhelming and intoxicating\". Through his ability, careful leadership of his team, artistic control, and by vastly exceeding the intended budget, Burges produced a building which \u2013 though not much larger than a parish church \u2013 has been described as \"a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to the Almighty's praise\".\n\n\n=== 20th and 21st centuries ===\n\nMindful that the cathedral was unlikely to be finished in his lifetime, Burges produced comprehensive plans for its decoration and furnishing; recorded in his Book of Furniture and Book of Designs. At the end of the 20th century, a major restoration of the cathedral, costing \u00a35 million, was undertaken. This included the reinstatement and restoration of the twin trumpets held by the resurrection angel which had been vandalised in 1999. The restoration programme also saw the cleaning, repointing and repair of the exterior of the building, including the re-carving of some of Burges' gargoyles, where repair proved impracticable. The cathedral's heating system was also replaced, when it was found to be damaging the intricate mosaic floor.In 2006, Lawrence and Wilson published the first detailed study of the cathedral's history and architecture, The Cathedral of Saint Fin Barre at Cork: William Burges in Ireland. The building is also covered in Frank Keohane's volume, Cork: City and County, in the Buildings of Ireland series, published in 2020. The cathedral is one of the three cathedrals of the Anglican Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.Notable interments in the graveyard include those of archbishop William Lyon (died 1617), Richard Boyle (died 1644), and in a family vault, the first \"Lady Freemason\", Elizabeth Aldworth (died c.\u20091773\u20131775).\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\nThe cathedral's style is Gothic Revival, Burges' preferred period which he used for his own home, The Tower House, in London. He reused elements of the unsuccessful designs he had earlier produced for competitions for cathedrals at Lille and Brisbane. The shell of the building is mostly limestone, sourced from near Cork, with the interior walls formed from stone brought from Bath. The red marble came from Little Island, the purple-brown stone from Fermoy.Each of the three spires supports a Celtic cross, a reference to Saint Patrick, seen as a foundational ancestor by both Irish Catholics and Protestants. This inclusion was an implicit statement of national identity, but was against Burges' wishes. His initial design included weather vanes, a choice rejected by the building committee, who, according to the historian Ant\u00f3in O'Callaghan, wanted the church to \"retain the continuity with the one true faith of the ancient past\".The spires had a troubled construction: it was a difficult build from a technical point of view and thus expensive to fund. The cost reached \u00a340,000 early in the build, with a further \u00a360,000 spent by the time the spires were in place. Along the way, a number of sub-contractors were hired and dismissed; the contract was eventually completed by the Cork builder John Delaney, hired in May 1876. By the end of the following year the main and two ancillary spires were complete.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n\nAn 1881 estimate by the local stonemason McLeod suggests that Burges provided around 844 sculptures, of which around 412 were for the interior. The total of some 1,260 sculptures include 32 gargoyles, each with different animal heads. Burges oversaw nearly all aspects of the design, headquartered in his office in Buckingham Street and on numerous site visits. Most modern scholars agree that his overarching control over the design of the architecture, statuary, stained glass and internal decorations, led to the cathedral's unity of style. He considered sculpture as an \"indispensable attribute of architectural effect\" and, at Saint Fin Barre's, believed he was engaged upon \"a work which has not been attempted since the West front of Wells Cathedral\". In the designs for the pieces decorating the cathedral, Burges worked closely with Thomas Nicholls, who constructed each figure in plaster, and with McLeod and local stonemasons, who carved almost all of the sculptures in situ.Burges' designs for the western fa\u00e7ade were based on medieval French iconography. He considered this front to be the most important exterior feature as it would be lit by the setting sun and thus the most dramatic. The theme is The Last Judgement, with representations of the twelve Apostles bearing instruments of their martyrdom, the Wise and the Foolish Virgins, the Resurrection of the Dead and the Beasts of The Evangelists. The gilded copper \"resurrection angel\" facing eastwards on the main spire is locally the cathedral's most iconic feature, and colloquially known as the \"goldie angel\". It was designed by Burges and erected in 1870 free of charge as his gift to the city, in recognition of Cork's willingness to fund his original design, and positioned in place of an intended wrought-iron cross.\n\nThe imagery of the tympanum is taken from the Book of Revelation, with the divine on the upper register, and mortals below. It shows an angel, accompanied by John the Evangelist, measuring the temple in Jerusalem, while beneath them the dead rise from their graves.  Of these sculptures, the Victorian critic Charles Eastlake, writing in A History of the Gothic Revival, considered that \"no finer examples of decorative sculpture have been produced during the Revival\".Burges found it difficult to realise some of his original images for the sculptures and stained glass panels; a number of them contained frontal nudes, including the designs for the creation of the planets, the figures of Adam and Eve, Christ in Glory, Our Lord as King Crucified, the dead rising from their graves, and the welcoming angels. In August 1868, some Protestant committee members, led by the chancellor, George Webster, rejected the use of images of the naked human body in ecclesiastical iconography, especially in images of Christ, and forced Burges to provide clothed designs, modesty-providing loin cloths, or strategically placed foliage or books. In frustration Burges wrote, \"I am sorry to see Puritanism so rampant in Cork ... I wish we could transplant the building to England\". His revised designs were reviewed in April and May 1869, but were again rejected. Both Gregg and the dean, Arthur Edwards supported Burges, and moved the decision from the general committee to a select vestry sub-committee. Although Webster continued to object, the modified designs were finally approved.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\n\n=== Plan and elevation ===\n\nThe cathedral's plan is conventional; the west front is opened by three entrance doors leading to the nave, with internal vaulting, arcade, triforium and clerestory, rising to a timber roof. Beyond the nave, the pulpit, choir, bishop's throne and altar end in an ambulatory. The small floor-plan drew criticism both at the time and in later years. The building is relatively short at 180 feet length, but contains all of the traditional elements of a cathedral of much greater size. A contemporary critic, Robert Rolt Brash, wrote; \"the effect of this is to make the building look exceedingly short, and disproportionately high\". Although modest in size, the compact design makes the most of the small footprint. The three spires allow the illusion of greater interior space.\n\n\n=== Main features ===\nBurges designed the majority of the interior, including the mosaic pavement, the altar, the pulpit and bishop's throne. The narrow and unusually high marble nave, from red and puce stone, is supported by large columns supporting the central tower and spire. The exterior gives the impression of a large structure, which is at odds with the reduced size of the interior, where the choir, sanctuary and ambulatory take up almost half of the floor-space. The interior is filled with colour, most especially from the stained glass windows. This aspect of the interior is in marked contrast to the uniform and austere grey of the exterior.\n\nThe cylindrical pulpit is located near the entrance and was completed in 1874, but not painted until 1935. Like the baptismal font, it is placed on four sculpted legs. It contains five stone relief figures, assumed to be the four evangelists, and Paul the Apostle sitting on an upturned \"pagan\" altar, and a winged dragon below the reading stand. The baptismal font is located near the entrance. Its ledge is decorated with a carving of the head of John the Baptist. The font's bowl is of Cork red marble, and supported by a stem, also red marble, a marble shaft of sculpted capitals, and an octagonal base. Brass lettering reads \"We are buried with Him by baptism into death\".The lectern (reading desk) is made of solid brass, from a design Burges had originally intended for Lille Cathedral. It is decorated with the heads of Moses and King David. There is a \"Heroes Column\" (War Memorial) by the Choir, at the Dean's chapel. It contains the names of 400 men from the dioceses killed in battle during the First World War. A processional cross, completed in 1974 by Patrick Pye, is located in front of the Dean's chapel. The 46-foot 'Great Oak Throne' of the Cork Dioceses Bishop was installed in 1878, alongside a statue of Fin Barre of Cork and a kneeling angel.\n\n\n=== Stained glass ===\n\nBurges conceived the iconographical scheme for the stained glass windows, designed the individual panels for the each of the 74 windows, and oversaw every stage of their production. According to Maurice Carey, \"in consequence, the windows have a consistent cohesive style and follow a logical sequence in subject matter\". The panels were cartooned by H. W. Lonsdale and manufactured in London between 1868 and 1869 by William Gualbert Saunders, who worked in Burges' office before forming his own firm of stained glass makers. Doctrinal objections to some of the figures, particularly of Christ, lead to a delay of four years, with their eventual installation between 1873 and 1881. Four windows remain incomplete. Lonsdale's cartoons are kept at the cathedral.\n\nMany of the figures relate to Christian iconography, and echo those in the tympanum, including, in the ambulatory a window showing God as the King of Heaven overlooking the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. In the panel, Matthew takes human form, Mark is depicted as a lion, Luke as an ox, while John takes the form of an eagle. As elsewhere in the cathedral, the illustrations can be divided between the divine, wise and foolish.The scheme begins and ends with two rose windows, at the west front and south transept respectively. The west rose window shows God as the creator resting on a rainbow and in the act of blessing. He is surrounded by eight compartments, each inspired by the scenes from Book of Genesis, beginning with the creation of light, and ending with the birth of Eve, and Adam naming the animals.  The south transept rose window, known as the \"Heavenly Hierarchies\", places Christ the King in the centre, with the compartments containing a series of angels, archangels and cherubim. Separate glass sheets containing building tools are placed between each angelic compartment.The nave windows contain signs of the Zodiac. Each lancet by the arcade contains a grisaille panel. These scenes are mostly from the Old Testament, while those from the transepts onward are of prophets who foretold Christ's coming, or from the New Testament. The clerestory panels above the high altar depict Christ reigning from his cross alongside His Mother, John, the Three Marys and various disciples. The windows around the ambulatory include scenes from the Life of Christ, culminating in a representation of heaven at worship from the Book of Revelation.\n\n\n=== Pipe organ ===\n\nThe organ was built in 1870 by William Hill & Sons. It consisted of three manuals, over 4,500 pipes and 40 stops. The main organ utilised a tubular-pneumatic action, with tracker action for the other two manuals. It was in place for the cathedral's grand opening on Saint Andrew's Day, 1870, and positioned in the west gallery, but moved to the north transept in 1889, to improve acoustics, maximise space, and avoid its interference with the view of the windows. That year, a 14-foot pit was dug in the floor beside the nave, as the new location for the organ.Its maintenance has been one of the most expensive part of the cathedral's upkeep. It was overhauled in 1889 by the Cork firm, T.W. Magahy, who added three new stops. The organ was moved from the west gallery (balcony) down to a pit in the north transept, where it sits today. Most of the choir organ is housed in an enclosure attached to the console, the lid of which can be raised or lowered electrically by the organist. The next major overhaul was in 1906 by Hele & Company of Plymouth, who added a fourth manual (the Solo). By this stage, the action of the organ was entirely pneumatic. In 1965\u20131966 J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London overhauled the soundboards, installed a new console with electropneumatic action, and lowered the pitch.By 2010 the organ's electrics were unreliable. Trevor Crowe was employed to reconstruct and increase the number of pipes, and make tonal enhancements, including a 32\u2032 extension to the pedal trombone. The project cost \u20ac1.2m and took three years to complete.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Make a point of coming here - even if you don't think cathedrals are 'your thing'. The interior is breathtaking, with lovely stained glass and marble decoration. And it feels so calm as well. This could be the best 6 Euro you will spend in Cork.",
          "This is a nice cathedral on the supposed site of continuous Christian worship since ~600 AD. The exterior is lovely, but the inside is honestly in need of some cleaning up.",
          "This was an unplanned tour, but we were so happy we did it. We were fortunate enough to encounter one of the curators who explained some of the history behind this building. Make sure you look for the cannonball and ask about its significance.",
          "This is a beautiful church both on the outside and the inside. Pink marble features on wall panels, most unusual. William Burges designed and started the build but the church wasn't finished until much later. Same old story they ran out of money and did things a bit at a time.",
          "A beautiful cathedral. Outside & inside. I felt it was worth the 6 euros to help pay for maintenance needed on a beautiful site",
          "Went to view today it\u2019s closed at 1-2 .Could have put notice outside.lots off old people disappointed.",
          "my first thought were on the building itself great design and lay out some lovely old painting in side and the old smell of wood and stone authentic and the keepers were very friendly and knowledgeable",
          "This cathedral is very nice, lots of beautiful stained glass windows, intricate stone work and ceiling paintings. The location is neat, not far from the river in small grassy area. Definitely worth the visit if you are fan of old churches and cathedrals.",
          "All I had to do was walk by before and after sunset to be fully impressed. This is an iconic structure for Cork.",
          "Toweringly impressive, St Fine Barre\u2019s Cathedral is found a little way from Cork city centre and a few minutes walk from Elizabeth Fort. Entry comes at a cost of 6 EUR per person (5 EUR for students) and you\u2019re provided with a leaflet on the grand history of this stunning",
          "Took a taxi from city center to St. Fin Barre. its only about 3/4 of a mile but its all up a hill at a pretty steep grade. the cost was $7 and well worth it. It is fabulous. The inside is just beautiful. The outside view of the church and the town was amazing.",
          "The cathedral is stunning! The grounds are gorgeous. The labyrinth was a great start to 2019! Definitely worth your time!",
          "It\u2019s a must do when visiting Cork. Amazing architecture, building , and windows. Visiting and helping with entrance fees for maintenance is a great way to keep these buildings for future generations to admire in time. Highly recommended",
          "Lots of cathedrals to see in Ireland and each with their own unique values in architecture but there was something about this cathedral that really drew me in. With the cemetery in the ground, the tombstones in the sidewalk, the intricate detail of the exterior carvings, there",
          "Absolutely fantastic building, highly recommended so much detail to see . Outside area is absolutely beautiful.",

          "First time visiting this beautiful cathedral. We spent as much time outside looking at the architecture as we did inside. Beautiful stained glass windows. I liked the simplicity inside and was drawn to the little kneeling cushions hanging on the pews. Staff were friendly and",

          "Very unique place. Great architecture. Try to experience any live music performance. Highly recommended. Peter",
          "I advised the person demanding money at the entrance that I didn't have 5 Euros on me. I was directed to the nearest cash machine in the university (further up hill from the cathedral). When I said I didn't want to walk further I was told \"what's wrong with you, you look fine to",
          "I can't fully comment as we were put off by the extortionate cost to see a Cathedral and as a result didn't enter. However we had a little look round the outside, could do with a jetwash and we googled the inside and decided it didn't warrant the 6 Euros. I must say that the",
          "Went round a lot of places in cork and this beautiful cathedral really takes your breath away - beautiful architecture and beautiful inside also - cork has many many beautiful sites and places to see - highly recommend a visit here",

          "A must do for all church lovers and people interested in beautiful building. It is one of the biggest Church of Ireland churches. Stunning",
          "A large victorian structure. Was OK not particularly inspiring. The outside was well worth looking at and interesting",
          "A really beautiful cathedral inside and out. Nice grounds/garden area to walk around as well. Make some time to visit this one if you are ever in Cork.",
          "Absolutely beautiful Cathedral with loads of detail on the exterior. I can't comment on the inside because they charge you to get in... a bit cheaky in my opinion as I've visited many other Cathedrals throughout the world, and even in my city of Norwich that only ask for",
          "This is an excellent spot to visit for any cathedral lovers. The architecture is wonderful, the art is also excellent. We have visited a number of cathedrals in Ireland and while they are not as extravagant as the Italian and French examples, they are all worth a visit. This",
          "This building is absolutely beautiful. A complete work of art. The grounds are lushes. The design's are exquisite , which have taken years to develop. This place is a hot spot in Cork, across from the Bishops resident it is mix of old and new. The Angel at the top has been the",

          "From the outside the church is impressive. However, the gravel paths and the high doorways make it impossible to enter. Where is a ramp for the handicapped? God is supposed to love them, too. It doesnt show in this church.",

          "A small cathedral (compared with others) but very very beautiful, it has a lot of details on the walls, this little building can be seen from almost all around Cork. You'll notice and it will catch your attention since the very first time. Once you get there it will take your",
          "Loved this grand cathedral inCork. I had been to Gougan Bara where St Finnbar began his hermit life. Full circle brings us to this gothic wonder complete with gargoyles and beautiful doors with carved statues of many saints on either side. A great example of Architect William",
          "This church was impressive. it's so ornate and beautiful. The grounds have been occupied since the 7th century, so the graveyard has some very old tombstones.worth a visit if you're doing the hop on/hop off city bus for sure!",
          "What a mesmerizing architecture. This Gothic structure needs to be visited. We were there and the history of the building itself is amazing. The entrance fee was only \u20ac6 per person but it was worth it!! The 70 stained glass tells a story, and if you want to know more I suggest",
          "Amazing to look at. Grounds also lovely. Can we it where ever you go in city. Not too far of a walk either",

          "Its a beautiful gothic church. It costs money to see this one though? We tried to get in for an evening choral service but it was apparently cancelled with no notice? I dont know... I just don't think churches should charge a fee to enter them.",
          "The grounds of the church are amazing, I especially loved the meditation garden! But the actual church? Way overpriced for the walk around and far too commercialised! Theres a gifts shop in the church for God\u2019s sake! Save your money and visit the outside gardens instead!",
          "The trip to St. Fin Barre's Cathedral was a pleasant walk.The grounds are nice and the labyrinth was interesting. The fee to enter the cathedral was steep so we skipped it.",
          "A magnificent church on a short walking distance from the city center. Beautiful garden with a labyrinth that gives you an opportunity to reflect on whatever you need to reflect on. Entrance fee to enter the church but free to visit the outside.",
          "In a city that is busy demolishing many old buildings, this one is worth a visit. Grand Victorian architecture and the traditional sound of a large pipe organ if you come at the right time. Unusual to see marble all round the walls (local from Cork) with gold engraved",
          "A historic church at the south-west of the city centre. Amazing architecture. I have regularly visited at Easter (hallelujah chorus)and at Christmas (choral recital of Xmas hymns). The congregation is relatively small, but faithful to their Church-of-Ireland version of the",
          "Stunning architecture. Very close to the shopping district and within walking distance. You can also take some cool pictures at the very edge of the property by the gate.",
          "We visited this cathedral and were really impressed by it. The architecture is fantastic. We walked around the grounds and prayed along the labyrinth. It was a beautiful place on a beautiful day.",
          "We (like many reviewers below) did not go inside, due to the entrance fee. But, I definitely recommend taking a walk around the grounds - the architecture is absolutely phenomenal.",
          "All the brochures and websites say a \"small\" and \"modest\" fee for entry, so I was expecting \u20ac2. \u20ac6 it is. That's a bit ridiculous. There's not much for your money's worth, so unless you're particularly into architecture, save your money and just take a walk around the grounds",
          "Like some other reviews we only looked outside and into the entrance hall. We did not go in as it was nearly prayer time at mid day and also 6 euros to get in. From the outside it looks great but inside not so much.",
          "I think the architect must have visited Gloucester cathedral as some similarities in the design. A massive amount of stained glass and interesting statues over the West door.",
          "We didn't do the tour, it was St. Patricks weekend and very busy, but it was beautiful from the outside.",
          "A Church of Ireland Cathedral, not especially awe inspiring in the way it was constructed. Still a thriving place to worship..",
          "The scale of this cathedral dedicated to the patron saint of Cork as seen from the outside is almost the most impressive thing about it. The interior is clearly Victorian neo-gothic and relatively plain. Particular features are the marble wall linings engraved with gold",
          "Well worth a visit if in Cork. Particularly worth while if you can visit at a time there is a choir, prayers or service on.",
          "Incredible cathedral from century 19th, amazing stain glass windows. When I was there just by coincidence the organ masters has benn playing and practicing few fantastics melodies. Around will find a fantastic garden and plot including all burrial stones. Breathtaking from",
          "My group of 14 Americans and I were looking forward to a meditative walk of the labyrinth at St. Finbar's. The exterior of the church is magnificent, as is the labyrinth. However, it's a very busy location so the street noise made the walk less than peaceful.",
          "St. Fin Barre\u2019s Cathedral was one of the oldest church I visited in Ireland, it was built between 1865 and 1879 and a Victorian gothic style Cathedral, you can also find a Labyrinth at the back of the church....",
          "So beautiful architecture, details. I could spend two days just looking at Cathedral. When you will be in Cork you need to visit this place, it is worth of your time.",
          "I was in Cork with my wife and girls: they were having their nails done ... so I went walking and exploring. This is a beautiful cathedral - around a 15-20 minute walk west from the city centre ... but well worth it. It does charge for entry (to aid the upkeep) - \u20ac6 for an",
          "St Fin Barre is the patron saint of Cork, who created a monastery where the Cathedral is now. It a less than 15 minutes from the city center. It costs 6 euros per person to enter and they use this towards the maintenance of the cathedral. This splendor of goth architecture of",

          "This is an old Catheral and is a must see if your visiting Cork only a short walk from UCC and the city centre. And very close to Elizabeth Fort.",
          "I always dislike paying to enter smaller less well known churches, or in this case a cathedral, when it is still a functioning place of worship and not a tourist attraction especially when it is not a major attraction. So, 6 Euro entry fee seems excessive. It is a substantial",
          "From the outside, with it's neogothic architecture towering over the city, St Finn Barre's Cathedral is well worth the visit. So much time can be spent taking in the awe-inspiring carvings on the front alone, the grounds are tranquil, and some of the grave stones are very old",
          "Really beautiful building from the outside weather across town or on its steps. However, was disappointed after paying for admission. In my opinion, save your money and just enjoy a stroll around the grounds.",

          "This Cathedral is just stunning. The stained glass is just fabulous!! Such a beautiful setting for a wedding!!",
          "Our tour group just had time for a quick peek at this beautiful cathedral. I love the Gothic look to this church - it is very beautiful. We were just able to visit the grounds of St Fin Barre's Cathedral, but from what I saw on the outside, I would love to come back for a",
          "This is a must see if visiting Cork.One of the most beautiful Church's we have ever seen! Well worth the visit.",
          "Built on a site where monasteries and churches have existed since the seventh century, St Finn Barre's is a wonderful example of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture. We weren't able to go in, since Sunday service was about to begin, but the exterior itself is worth viewing.",
          "Went here on the 29th around noon and it was closed so had to wait for it to open along with other people waiting. It is nice but have seen nicer cathedrals else where. Nothing special or overly memorable",
          "The entrance fee was 5 Euros and worth the cost. The ground were gorgeous and the labyrinth was nice and peaceful. The inside of the church was stunning. The organist was practicing while I was there and it was a beautiful sound in the cathedral. Very much worth the visit!",
          "I visited here with my husband on a cold but sunny day at the end of November. It was \u20ac5 to get in which seems slightly steep but it's to help to keep the Cathedral renovated etc. so we didn't mind. The man that sold our tickets was really helpful and told us a bit of the",

          "Beautiful well preserved gothic church in the heart of the city. Easy street parking nearby. Wonderful staff who answered all my questions. 5 Euro donation for entrance. The self guided tour is extremely informative - the church is filled with beautiful art, stained glass",

          "Had to be satisfied with a quick peek inside as they were holding a service. Definitely worth seeing while in Cork.",
          "St. Fin Barre is a beautiful cathedral inside and out. The beauty is matched by its interesting history. A small entrance fee is required but well worth it. The staff and brochure were helpful.",

          "We took a shirt 10 minute walk from Fernroyd House to visit this Cathedral- it\u2019s a spectacular sight looming over the city- it\u2019s a gorgeous gorgeous place that has kept its integrity inside by not replacing the original flooors, windows and such. It\u2019s an amazing feeling inside",
          "Magnificent. Such a beautiful cathedral and interesting history, detail, symbolism, and design by William Burges. A summary of the history was enjoyable and worth our time. Wish we could attend a service there, its amazing, elaborate and awesome.",
          "Soaring ceilings with Gothic detail are awing. I could feel the power of the Cathedral (and I'm a non-worshiper). Beautiful at night. In daylight (also very good looking) there are tombstones around the sides and back, adding to the Gothic feel. We went for Sunday 3:30 pm",
          "I am a huge fan of architecture, and St. Fin Barre's Cathedral did not disappoint. It was a beautiful place to spend the morning, both inside and out. The grounds are wonderful too - it was so peaceful walking around in the old graveyard.",

          "If you love stained glass, this should be on your bucket list. The old and new Testament are depicted in each section of windows and they are out of this world when the sun pours through them. You could spend days on the stained glass alone. The architecture design is artistic",

          "I love, love, love old churches, but traveling around Europe means having to make choices. This is a very unique structure. Gothic architecture. Lovely guides provided for a very reasonable fee to tour the church. Our boys (8,8, and 12) all found something to enjoy. Gorgeous",
          "The cathedral is nice inside and out but one has to pay 5 euros per adult and 3 euros per child. We were given information leaflets which were good to read but not worth 5 euros each.",
          "We happened to visit St. Finbarre's during an open house, so our impromptu visit was rewarded with historical stories and were able to climb the belltower and watch a demonstration of bell ringing. What a treat. The Cathedral is a gorgeous piece of architecture and the people",

          "The Cathedral was very close behind our hotel, so we walked over one morning. You enter through the gift shop and there is a charge to enter, but that's just part of it - places like this are very costly to maintain and it is a minor contribution. We arrived just before a",

          "Ok to visit and take a quick look inside but there is a Euro5 per head to enter, for a Cathedral that is not of any great significance or quality I would prefer a smaller donation. Anyway, visited, paid the money, ok but not great value.",

          "We didn't have time to go inside but the pretty, 10 minute, walk from the city centre was certainly worth it to see this spectacular building before we had to leave for our flight. The dark limestone, gothic sculptures and three piercing Spires transport you to an entirely",
          "Great looking building espeshally at night but didn't go in as it was e5 entrance which won't pay on principle as the church is one of the richest organisations in the world",
          "When visiting Cork, you must also visit this Cathedral. An amazing piece of neo-classical architecture. \u20ac5 entrance (which can be paid via card). But well worth the visit.",
          "We went to Cork on a sunny spring day, and took a nice walk, in the city. Early afternoon it is started to rain, and we decide to look after some roof over our head, so we decided to visit the castle. At the entrance there were a very kind man, who collected the entrance fees,",
          "A short walk out of the main city area, this large church building was a very peaceful haven and a lovely opportunity to reflect. The exterior is very imposing and the interior is rather attractive. It's not as big as many cathedrals, so it is possible to absorb more of the",
          "Both the insides and the outsides look incredible. You have to pay a fee of 5\u20ac (adult) to enter and get a leaflet with informations about the cathedral by the staff. The guy at the front desk did explain the cathedrals history to me in a very short and compact way which I really",

          "Many beautiful colourful stained glass windows are, to me, the highlight of this peaceful cathedral. An exhibition of icons added to the interest.",
          "We attended this cathedral for a concert of Irish related music!! The cathedral is beautiful with wonderful stained glass windows!! High altar and pulpit are elegant!! It was nice visiting the church in the evening without large groups of tourists!",
          "If you see only one cathedral/church in Cork this is the one to see. It is spectacular inside. 5 Euro entrance fee.",
          "Heard the big organ being played during my visit - ornate and peaceful place to worship. Take a little time ti enjoy it while in Cork. I liked the little pamphlet that helps guide you around.",

          "This Church is impressive and very beautiful. There is a lot to see and just to get the history is fascinating. The cool thing I thought was that the guy who sold the ticket gave me an introduction and explained the stained windows which were absolutely beautiful.",
          "I must say I'm in love with Cork city. Amazing people and wheather, but St Finn Barres gave me a very religion impression. I want to thank the priest of this place for letting me to understand more about the Christian religion. Hope to return some day to this amazing place",
          "Beautiful cathedral with tons of stained glass and cool architecture. This was our favorite Cathedral from our entire trip. Definitely make the stop if you have the time.",
          "A fascinating part of cork this has a lot of Masonic heritage with symbols and signs throughout for those that have an interest. A beautiful building that should be included in any sight seeing visit to the city, no matter what you religious persuasion.",
          "Could not really visit the inside as it was closed even though the announced opening hours said should be open. There was going to be a concert later on and only instrument players were allowed.",
          "Yes, there's been a Christian church on this site for more than 1,000 years, but it isn't this cathedral that's been here all that time. As far as cathedrals you can visit in the UK or in Europe, it's quite ordinary. It's certainly not a destination but would be something to",
          "We went to a concert performed by London Concertante recently and it was a great evening This is a fantastic venue for a small concert easy to get to and great acoustics",
          "This is an awe inspiring cathedral with vivid coloured windows. It provides a peaceful haven and we were made to feel very welcome by the volunteers who man it.",
          "From the moment i spotted this imposing sight upon the hill from our hotel it was just one of those places you just have to get a closer look at and just can't take your eyes away from as you near it,in my opinion it looks as stunning up close as it does from afar. We did not go",
          "I disagree with religious places with entry fees, so even if it is cheap, i'd recommebd having a look from the outside and visit the numerous churches in Cork for an insider sight for free !",
          "The Cathedral is nice but nothing super remarkable. The 5 euros per adult fee is just too much for this",
          "Even though there was an entrance fee (5 for adults) it was worth the visit. Friendly cashier who was happy to give some more explanation about the stain glass windows. Interesting, but it doesn't take long to visit (30 mins max for the average tourist). We were especially",
          "We was very excited to go. Apart from paying to go in you can't even take pictures. Very disappointed",

          "Beautiful Cathedral to visit. Had a great guide that walked us thru the church. Can't wait for our next visit to Ireland",
          "Amazing gothic cathedral right in the heart of Cork city. Reasonable entry fee and very knowledgeable guides. Cork is steeped in history. Ask about the cannon ball lodged in the wall. Great story.",
          "On entering St. Fin Barre's Cathedral, I was asked for a \u20ac5 entrance fee. I asked what was the purpose of the fees and if I needed to pay to pray. I was then told the fee would not be necessary but that I should use the central aisle only. How odd? Surely the 'House of God'",
          "I took a solo walk through the grounds outside the cathedral, and it is quite impressive. One could spend an hour looking at all of the details that are in the structure. Excellent spot for lunch if the weather is nice. I did not have a chance to go inside, but I am sure it was",
          "Whether Cathedral visits is your thing or not, if visiting Cork city it would be a shame to pass on this gem. As good if not better than any similar structure in the world.",
          "The Staff including guide were very helpful - stunning - stained glass windows throughout Cathedral at every aspect with sandstone walls, cork granite, Connemara and Kilkenny marble nicely co-ordinated. Sun casts the colour on the stained glass windows onto the sandstone walls -",

          "The cathedral was wonderful for the annual Christmas Carol Concert. It is a beautiful old building and well known for its great acoustics. The tickets were long sold out, tribute to the esteem both the building and carollers are held.",
          "We saw this place from the Elizabeth Fort and decided to pay a visit. The chap was very helpful a font of knowledge not found in the guide books. One of the most fascinating items they have is an original WW1 cross from the battlefield after being replaced by the famous white",
          "I visit St Fin Barres cathedral.It is a lovely building with the most beautiful stain glass windows.",
          "St. Fin Barre's Cathedral is a magnificent work of art! From the moment you step onto the grounds, you sense the spirits that linger in this beautiful church. It has the most stained glass windows of any church in Ireland and is well worth the visit. The cathedral docent was",
          "This is another truly beautiful building designed by William Burges in 1870. It is a 13th Century French Gothic style. The frontage alone is breathtaking in detail. The interior would not be out of place in any major European City.",
          "This is a beautiful Cathedral. The stain glass in particular is worth seeing. I think it's a lovely spot. Quite peaceful. It's not too far from the City centre so it's worth a walk up to it. I like that part of the city.",
          "I admire the classic and amazing Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. Wonderful bishop care about community and kyou can feel personal greeting from him. Going on Christmas next time. Making very special athmosphere by the organ music and choire",

          "Victorian Gothic style Cathedral - well worth a visit - stunning mosaics and stained glass windows. Helpful and informative staff on hand.",
          "St Fin was right behind our hotel in Cork, and I'm so glad that we were able to see it. It's beautiful inside, and I loved learning about the history of the Cathedral. I definitely recommend taking some time to visit this beautiful place.",
          "When we stopped by, there was a funeral taking place - so we unfortunately did not go inside. But were able to walk around the property. Such a captivating sight to see and the grounds were so peaceful. Definitely a must see in person if you're in the area!",
          "This is an amazing building. Just walking around the outside and enjoying the cemetery and park like grounds is a treat.",
          "beautiful building we bought tickets from groupon so saved a few euro. Calm serene cathedral worth a visit and easy to find.Great Italian coffee shop nearby.",
          "We visited Ireland in September/October, 2016 and drove to Cork which is a large, sprawling and confusing to drive city. We happened upon this absolutely stunning Cathedral and paid the admission fee to actually walk around it. The outside as well as inside was beautiful. A",
          "There are so many cathedrals and churches across the globe, it becomes easy just to walk on past. We're thankful we didn't this time because St Fin Barre's is a stunning display of creativity, mastery and story-telling sculptures. The architect won a competition to design it",
          "We did not time our visit to go inside - next time! But the outside views of this impressive cathedral are out of this world. It sits on a hill, with streets and sidewalks bordering at least 3 sides. Such close-up splendor while just walking about the town is very special.",
          "This Cathedral was magnificent! The Gothic architecture was so inspiring and had such a powerful presence to it. We visited on a quite, sunny morning and were able to walk the labyrinth outside alone. There was no one else there at the time which enabled us to really reflect on",
          "It was my first experience to be asked for payment on entry to the church, but I beleive it's not a last... Saying that I should be clear that fee is not required for those who come to practise or pray, visitors only. Great architecture and engineering work, still in fairy well",
          "Close to downtown Cork and well worth a visit . The stain glass windows were stunning and the architecture was something special.",
          "We strolled here on a short walk from downtown Cork - beautiful church with a very interesting and different architecture. We enjoyed the stained glass windows. Wish we had the time to take a tour. Next time.",
          "A young man from the front office gave us a very nice tour with a full history of the church and all the stained glass windows and the stories they told. The glass in the back started with the old testament and progressed to the front to the crucifixion. I also took a picture of",
          "St Fin Barre's Cathedral truly left me speechless. I don't know if I have ever been in a more amazingly beautiful building. Be sure to grab the free literature they pass out at the entrance. It is an informative and interesting guide to an incredible piece of living history.",
          "Beautiful Victorian cathedral - besides their services and day time visits, they host excellent concerts, especially at Christmas",
          "St Fin Barre's Cathedral is a beautiful place mostly in days with the sun. If you like take pictures you should go to enjoy.",
          "Cobh is a quiet little sea-side town. In summer, you'll hear trad music coming out of a pub or two and they'll be a few dozen people fishing off the pier. The Cathedral looms over it all majestically. The complexity of it's architecture stands out against the smaller",
          "Amazing interior. Lovely stained glass windows. Very imposing building. Well worth visiting. Interesting layout.",
          "Beautiful church with the most stained glass window depicting the bible story in the world. Really enjoyed walking around. Very helpful chap at the desk, gave us a potted history and pointed out interesting features of the Cathedral, including the cannon ball!",

          "An impressive church both inside and out. I do, however, object to paying to get in to a place of worship and to enter you are charged \u20ac5 each. However, that is my personal feeling. The church is interesting and with seeing.",
          "Did not pay to go inside but the outside offers much to appreciate. The exterior grounds are as interesting as the many features of the building itself.",
          "I only walked around the exterior, but found it quite enjoyable. There is a charge to enter for upkeep reasons, so I stayed outside with my young cousin so my relatives could enjoy the interior. We had a great time trying to find gargoyles and different animal heads. There is a",
          "A little way out of town, but the flat walk along the riverside is worth it. The carved figures beside the front doors provide a warm welcome to the visitors. Lovely warm feeling inside and the history is really interesting. Nice stain glass examples...",
          "Huge church with an amazing stained glass window. A treasure not to be missed.The sculptures are phenomenal.",
          "St. Fin Barre's is a beautiful cathedral and is very accessible. A Church of Ireland (Anglican) short service occurs every day at 12:30, which we attended in the small side chapel. The priest was very friendly and helpful, and afterward explained the \"Misery Card\" to us--ask",
          "Well preserved church, your allowed to roam the interior. Beautify wood work and stone masonry. Stained Glass windows are vibrant.",
          "This Church sits up high above city centre. You can see it in the distance and its beauty draws you to get a closer look and to photograph it. You'll see what I am talking about when you walk around Cork and keep seeing it in the distance!",
          "We arrived late but cannot fault the guide who although site was closing allowing the guide 20 minutes less than planned for tour he gave us a fantastic tour plus an insight into the history of the venue that will stay with us. A venue worth seeing seeing even if you just",
          "As Seniors we paid 4 euros each for admission but felt that this was not unreasonable. This Anglican Cathedral is awe inspiring with many attractive stained glass windows. The organ has recently been refurbished and the pipes are set from 14feet below ground level to reduce the",
          "Did not enter as it charged a fee for doing so. Easy walk from downtown area and easy to find. Walked around the outside.",
          "The Cathedral is a sham of course but what a sham! And by sham I mean it imitates the very best of gothic cathedrals across Europe while being an awful lot younger. Well worth the visit to a truly beautiful Church.",
          "a long walk to this, then a 5 euros fee to go in, not worth it unless you particularly love to see cathedrals.",
          "Designed and built in Victorian times, this building is almost overwhelming in its sheer scale, dominating the skyline of Cork as it does. Having a particular love of stained glass, I can honestly say that I was not prepared for the astonishing creations and the sheer number of",
          "We had a quick visit to the cathedral but long enough to take in the exhibition of the Easter Rising. The interior is as impressive as the exterior",
          "Anybody that visits Cork must see this beautiful restored Cathedral Set in the Southside of the City it's building is second to none Steeped in history and a must see Please take the time if your in beautiful Cork City",
          "Please check this out for thE stained glass windows and the amazing mosaics designs on the floor. Similar designs on the floor of the chapel at nearby UCC. Wonder who created those floors?!",
          "Well worth a visit, it is as impressive a building as any in Cork. Be aware of service times as this may affect your visit.",
          "What a fantastic and beautiful structure. It is a magnificent Cathedral and so rich in history. Take time to wander around the grounds and look at the ancient tombstones.",
          "This church is hidden in a student neighborhood in Cork, but it was well worth finding. You are impressed just wandering the grounds. We arrived too late for a tour but just enjoyed circling the place from the street and seeing all the angles of architecture.",
          "We stopped here while in Cork. It was very interesting, especially the organ! I wish we could have stayed longer to hear it in a service. The docents were very helpful. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "Upon entering we had a price list barked at us. Not really fitting to the welcoming sign at the door, or the donation request that is more common for places of worship.",
          "Its a great place to explore and revive your calm side on a rainy afternoon. The place has brilliant architecture and does deals for students which is a plus.",
          "We were just in time for their tour and the detail was great. History of the stain glass was very interesting just as the information given on the organ. Well informed guide who gave a very good tour",
          "Iconic Cork city Cathedral of St. Fin Barre's it can be seen from most parts of Cork city. I use to drive pass it every day and i used to look at it with a big proud face. Its beautiful outside and its stunning from inside.",
          "Fabulous spires projecting into the heavens. There is a Golden Angel which protects the Cathedral, and if removed will signal the end of the world. It is a wonderful Cathedral, with a beautiful Rose Window surrounded by the Apostles. Inside ! It is awesome, truly magnificent.",
          "Just to correct the recent Italian reviewers comment on being charged to enter a church, St. Fin Barre's is Anglican, not Catholic",
          "Being Italian I know that the catholic church loves money. But I never had to pay to enter a church. It's a shame, in my opinion ZA that a holy place has to be commercial",
          "If you have an interest in History ,church design , symbolism or Christian religion this is a most . The Catheral is easily found and a tour is a most ,there are two caretakers / guides who were very helpful and run the site with military like precision. Even if you you are not",
          "A wonderful and magical looking cathedral .. absolutely worth a trip to see the detailing here .. ...",
          "This is well worth a visit especially to see the stained glass windows. The only femaie freemason is remembered here - and that's a story worth hearing. There is also a link to Brecon Cathedral as two South Wales Borderers are remembered in a stained glass window.",

          "St. Fin Barre\u2019s has a menacing look to it with gargoyles and griffins around the outside. That being said, the architecture is absolutely beautiful. It's costs 5 euro to enter. I would visit this cathedral again. Worth seeing if you're in Cork!",
          "We enjoyed seeing the Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral and walking through the grounds. We were annoyed that there is a 5 Euro per person admission charge. \"Pay to pray\" is not acceptable to us. There must be a better way to raise money than \"preying\" on tourists.",
          "Went to have a look at this on a day visit to Cork but you have to pay \u20ac5 to go in. I don't think you should have to pay to enter a church therefore we didn't go in.",
          "Truly inspirational visit . Amazing . Excellent guide who shared great details of Cathedral with us. Ashamed to say as an Irish person was not aware of the beauty of this cathedral and the magnificent work in the outdoor carvings and stained glass windows.",
          "Extremely fascinating place. The building is massive and rich of details. The spacious churchyard with the old graves is so soothing. Be wary that there is a fee to enter but I do think it is totally worth to pay a visit, at least to the exteriors.",
          "This cathedral, an Anglican cathedral in an overwhelmingly Catholic town, demonstrates that when it was built, there was a huge hope that it could be the spiritual center for Cork. It is so beautiful. It is a perfect example of Late Victorian Neo--Gothic revival. I found it",
          "An imposing architectural gem of a Cathedral featuring stained glass, mosaics, wood carvings, stone gargoyles, griffins etc. The grounds with the ancient tombs and gardens contributed to a most interesting visit. Very happy to have come upon it. A must-see when visiting",

          "Buetiful old structure with outstanding stone and timber sculptures and panels, it is simply mesmerising. There is a nominal cover charge to enter into the Cathedral however it is well worth it for some quiet reflection. To walk the grounds is free and well worth your time with",
          "We visited here with a friend from the States who wanted to go to church and hear a live Choir. The interior is breathtaking and for someone visiting Cork well worth a visit any day of the week as it is just minutes from the city centre. We have since been back as part of the",
          "This Cathedral is fascinatingly located at the top of a hilly town of Cork. You can easily and surely see this huge structure from the town proper. Ancient and elegant Cathedral structure and once you've reached the church, one can see the beautiful view of Cork (Cobh Island).",
          "The great William Burges created St Finbarr's 150 years ago. The elaborate finishes are a sight to be seen. The stone masonry in particular is breathtaking. The Cathedral itself is small in comparison with Pugin's Cathedral in Cobh which was being built at the same time. Built",
          "One of the many cathedrals we visited in Cork, the view of St Fin Barre's is outstanding from several locations throughout the city. The details in the architecture are stunning and ornate. Definitely a worthwhile addition to any trip to Cork.",
          "we only visited from the outside. amazing sculptures telling christian stories surround the doorway. our guide explained their meanings.",
          "The view outside the cathedral is simply stunning and a must see. We did go inside but not sure it is worth the price as there is nothing too amazing inside. I would definitely spend some time checking this out if your in Cork.",
          "Big old church. Very impressive from outside but very uninspiring inside. I think that the other churches in the city are much prettier Inside and u do not have to pay a fiver to see them..",
          "Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the environment, very relaxing. Ideal for the ones that are interested in old monuments, history and/or Religion. Breathtaking interior!",

          "When my husband asked what I liked about this cathedral, the first thing that came to mind is how alive it is. It's clearly an active place of worship and community. For example, we saw examples posted of schoolchildren's efforts to draft a \"New Proclamation for Ireland\" in",
          "St. Fin's Barre Cathedral is utterly beautiful from the exterior. We first happened by in the evening a listened to the ethereal bells. I was so enchanted, we came back the next morning to see the church. After taking pictures outside and enjoying the exterior, we were",

          "St. Fin Barre's is in the city center and beckoned to us to visit. We were quite fortunate in that as we were exiting, we asked the fellow who collected our donation where the organ was located. He indicated where we could find it, and as we did, the Dean of the church",
          "One of my favourite churches. A beautiful piece of architecture. I love the stain glass in there. It's within easy access of the City Centre. There is a lovely Italian restaurant nearby. Dolce Vita",
          "The cathedral is only a short (nice) walk from the centre of Cork and is worth seeing. We didn't want to pay the \u20ac5 euro (\u20ac3 for students) to see the whole inside of the cathedral but the grounds and the building itself are stunning. Nice to take the time and walk around, we",
          "Just an amazing building, An architects dream right in the heart of cork city with so much going on around you",

          "We only briefly visited the Cathedral as part of the walking tour of Cork. It is a very impressive structure and the history of the build was very interesting. We didn't have time to go inside but even from the outside it is worth a visit. Try not to go on a very rainy day like",
          "Went for a look on a sunny afternoon. The architecture is exquisite and the grounds well kept. Bear in mind its an operating church so tourists can't get inside until after 1pm on Sundays. The church warden asks for \u20ac5 to \"help with the upkeep\" if you want to see inside!!",

          "Went to visit the cathedral with a few friends. Staff was helpful and the cathedral had a nice well kept garden. All in all I personally don't think anyone should pay to enter a holy establishment I guess that's my opinion. It's a must see for cork visitors and once your done",
          "This is a wonderful cathedral with a small entrance charge (5 euros) but worth it. You get a short talk and an excellent leaflet - do read this and look out for al the things on it as some will not be obvious without the guidance. It has 76 very colourful stained glass windows,",
          "When i went there,the staff asked me if I need other language pamphlet and gave me a Japanese one(because I'm Japanese). Inside is very beautiful,peaceful and calm. Someone was playing pipe organ which was fantastic! You have to pay about \u20ac5 at the entrance. I thought it was a",
          "St Finn barrs cathedral is a delight The organ is huge and the style is clearly French The external walkways are gorgeous! Very deep humbling experience!!!",
          "One of the crazy things about this church is that the external walkways are made up of old tombstones. It is a beautiful and imposing church. The current edifice is not that old (relatively speaking)--dating from the late 1800s. However, there have been churches on that site",
          "This cathedral has clear French influence with beautiful details, fine statues, gargoyles and other things not typical for Irish churches, so it definitely stands out and is worth a visit. We really enjoyed trying to figure out the meaning presented in the sculptures at the",
          "We only took a look from the outside, but wow! The view was spectacular. I particularly appriciate how the building was always well lit up every night. Such a lovely building to begin seeing on our trip to Ireland",
          "Enjoyed our visit and the 2 staff where very helpful regarding the history of the Cathedral and gave us excellent information of where the best places to visit in Cork for musical entertainment for St Patricks Festival.",
          "This Catherdral has the largest organ of any church or Cathedral on all of Ireland. The colony's are breathtaking and this is a must for Cork!",
          "This is such a beautiful Gothic revival cathedral! We weren't able to go in because mass was going on, but the outside is absolutely beautiful. There's also a medieval archway as part of the wall, but unfortunately it's not marked as such! This is definitely worth a visit, even",
          "We visited at the weekend and the arcitecture draw is stunning. It is only a 5 minute walk out of the city across the river but well worth the walk. It reminded me of Notre Dame in Paris. It cost a 3 euros donation to go in but well worth paying to help towards its upkeep.",
          "Recently visited this beautiful building which I had passed without a thought for many years . Conveniently located within walking distance of the city centre it is steeped in history and architecturally stunning particularly the magnificent ceiling. Understand that a",

          "This is a lovely place to visit whilst in cork. It is absolutely beautiful to look at and to take photos of. It is worth the 5 euro entry fee too. The history of the Cathedral is very interesting and the staff are very knowledgeable.",
          "We took a train ride from Dublin, out to Cork and the tour included a stop here. I was super impressed with the visit. This is by far one of the most beautiful Catheral's I have ever visited. Make SURE you take both your camera! Take cash as well, cause you can purchase some",
          "The tour I was on was given by one of the priest's and was so interesting. From the stain glass windows to the underground organ I found the whole experience captivating. I got a sneak look at some very strange wood carvings that are on some seats. A must see when in Cork",
          "Altough the entrance fee is quite high, we really enjoyed the interior of this church. The painted windows are awesome.",
          "St Finbarre's is a short walk from the city centre, which takes you along the river, and around some lovely little side streets which show off Cork's quaint areas. it would probably take around 8-10 minutes to walk here from Patrick's Street if you are of average fitness.",
          "If you like fine architecture or just like to look at old churches, don't miss this when you're in Cork. Even if you don't go inside, you will be amazed at the stature and character of this great cathedral. It's not an old cathedral, compared to others in Europe - it was started",
          "This was a very interesting visit and one which we highly recommend. It only costs \u20ac5 entrance fee and staff are most welcoming and helpful. We wandered around on our own initially and then tagged on to the end of a tour which was being given to a group of students. It\u2019s",
          "My niece and I recently visited St Finbarres Cahthedral as she is very interested in architecture. She was highly impressed and so was I. The stained windows are magnificent. The staff were nice and it was worth the five euro entrance fee. Well worth a visit and would recommend",
          "We walked around the cathedral on a rainy day on Christmas eve and even with the grey skies it was breathtaking. When we reached the front there was some friendly volunteers who invited us to join the service later that evening for some Christmas carols and we are so happy we",
          "Me and my partner are from Cardiff so we had to pop in as the same architecture created many rooms at Cardiff castle.",
          "This gem, in it's elevated position, is a familiar sight in Cork's skyline, and loved by all Cork people. It is also known as the \"Procathedral\" because of it's Protestant heritage! The external views are lovely and convey the gothic influence. The internals are OK but not",
          "This is one of Cork's main cathedrals but incredibly it was closed on the Sunday morning I visited which is rather strange. Nice form the outside though.",
          "Amazing gothic building, both inside and out. Fantastic stained glass. Superb tower inside. Great guided tour. Small labyrinth in the grounds does what it promises - makes you think. The best sight in Cork.",
          "st finbarrs cathedral is an iconic ediface in cork city centre located within walking distance of ucc the mardyke and patrick street",
          "Paid a visit after reading reviews here. \u20ac5 in is a bit steep and I couldn't really recommend it on that basis alone. It's a lovely building and is very attractive but I think it would be better to allow donations at the visitors' discretion. Worth visiting the outside if you",
          "Me and my husband love towers and cathedrals... This church is breath taking and worths to visit !!!",
          "The English market in Cork City is a real gem with a continental atmosphere We visited on Saturday and it was buzzing with good humoured Cork people and is obviously very well run and clean. Another plus for Cork.",
          "I had the opportunity to visit St. Fin Barre's Cathedral with family while in Cork and was really impressed by the history and architecture of the building. Great activity to see while in Cork.",
          "The Cathedral is much nicer from the outside than inside. It has a huge pipe organ recently refurbished and the staff/volunteers are really nice. Admittance is \u20ac 5.",
          "St Fin Barre's is a gorgeous cathedral that is well worth the visit. You can see the spires from all over town and here the bells chime. The architecture and grounds are very pleasant to see. You may not spend more than 15-30 minutes but it's worth it to stop by anyway.",
          "We took a walk up to see the cathedral and were very impressed with its beauty. A stunning building inside & out. The stained glass windows are beautiful.",
          "Spent an hour looking round this very impressive building - took us a while to find the cannon ball!. One of the assistants spent some time explaining and showing us the refurbished pipe organ - wonderful stained glass windows abound",
          "For a small fee you can learn about the cathedral and see for yourself how beautiful the architecture is. The man at the from desk was more than friendly and you get a post card with the cathedral on the front when you leave! It really is worth a visit whilst in Cork as the",
          "Go walk by and visit the cathedral very beautiful. There are 3 euro admission passes on groupon also 3 euros for a student. We opted to skip the inside because we have visited so many churches and cathedrals during our stay. However if in cork it is worth a view. The",
          "Unlike the splendor of Cobh Cathedral, St Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork is rather underwhelming with what could be considered as a plain interior. The obligatory entrance fee of \u20ac5 included a map, a candle to light inside the cathedral and a free low-quality image on a",
          "It is beautiful from the outside but I was completely turned off by having to pay to enter this cathedral. I understand expenses on upkeep are high but of all the churches and cathedrals in Ireland this was the first and only one where payment was required before entering.",
          "Having spent over a week travelling across Ireland at a rate of approx. 2 churches or cathedrals a day, I think this is not the greatest example on the inside. It could be the ongoing restoration work, but it seemed like a reverse tardis, smaller on the inside than the outside.",
          "Went to sunday mass Amazing cathedral local people so friendly if your in cork city well worth a visit",
          "The cathedral's exterior is gorgeous, and can be seen rising majestically on a hill as one approaches it, viewing it from the bridge that crosses the river that flows through Cork. It was built in the 19th century, but suggestive of a French cathedral of earlier times. Its",
          "My husband and I visited St. Fin Barre's Cathedral on September 7, 2015. It was within walking distance from our hotel and you could see it from all over the city. Not sure if there was parking available as we walked there. The cathedral offered a self-guided tour which was",
          "A beautiful building Not very big Marvellous spires Golden arch Angel Very good acoustics Fabulous Organ Well worth a visit",
          "I visited here in May 2014. The cathedral is located on a lovely little property with a nice view of Cork. Tip: Climb up the steep, dark staircase to be rewarded with a truly stunning view of Cork. This is one of the most impressive sights in Ireland.",
          "This was a nice small cathedral with unique history and beautiful craftsmanship. Don't miss it when in Cork!",
          "Walk to the Cathedral from the city center, great walk. The architecture is stunning, lots of history and the staff were very welcoming.",
          "We walked to the cathedral which is lovely. Built on the spot where a church built in 1590 was torn down for the cathedral to be built in the 1860s.. Amazing to think this was a place of worship since St. Fin Barre founded a monastery there in 606 AD. Of course, I could not",
          "An amazing church inside and out. Great history and friendly helpful staff inside the church. Worth a visit.",
          "Not only beautiful Christian architecture, but a structure loaded with symbolism. Saw this church on a walking tour, and highly recommend seeing it with someone who can point out all the details.",
          "this lovely Cathedral is a place of Christian worship! It was an honor to come into a church where the presence of God could be discerned by the faithful. Beautiful architecture and interior!",
          "The church is beautiful. There is a self-guided tour that visitors can do. It's relatively short because the church isn't a huge cathedral. It's definitely worth your time if you are in Cork.",
          "\"another bloody cathedral\"...and a very, very good one! there are many graves all around the parking lot-which is small. $5E to get in. has 4 spires, which is a little rare. worth the trip for sure! close to UCC-the university. 3 of us took a private cab from Blarney Castle",
          "Magnificent cathedral with a beautiful carrillion ringing of bells every Sunday and during the week as well",
          "We visited St Fin Barre during the day. I wish they would let you explore more than just the first floor. They have a big organ but we did not hear it play. I really enjoyed the view of the cathedral at night. It is light up and looks majestic.",
          "What a beautiful church! This church shows that, even without the Roman splendor, a church can still be grand. The Irish accents are also quite notable!",
          "Interesting Cathedral with lots of hidden gems. Go around the back and walk the garden maze, it's lots of fun!",
          "St. Fin Barre's cathedral is the 2nd largest cathedral in Ireland, the first being St. Patrick's in Dublin. I personally thought St. Fin's was more beautiful both inside and outside, but if you've seen one there's no need to pay to get in the other. If you're in cork stop by",
          "Considered the architectural \"gem\" of Cork, this Catheral is truly magnificent inside and out. If you're an architecture, religion or history buff, St. Fin barre's is a must visit when in Cork! The Tour costs only 5euros and we were fortunate to upgrade to a guided tour free of",
          "a gothic marvel, the structure is amazing and the inside is so peaceful. the walk up the hill to it is quite steep so if you are easily winded it might be worth getting a taxi",
          "I understand the diocese needs money to maintain the cathedral. I just disagree with the lack of clear signposting of any charge to enter the cathedral. It wouldn't cost much to put up a paper sign at the door explaining this and it might actually get visitors to contribute a",
          "St Fin Barre's slightly resembles Notre Dame Cathedral (apparently the architect trained in Paris). It's quite lovely to just look around outside and admire the intricate details of the building.",
          "Really nice architecture, old, well conserved. There is no staff guiding your visit, but it is close to Cork and you can walk there. I spend at least one hour observing the details on the structure, just outside, and resting on the nice park.",
          "Our visit was recommended by a friend and was definitely worth a visit. A very peaceful place and beautiful architecture. We sat inside for an hour or so, taking in the sights. 5 euros p/p for admission",
          "Worth a visit to this religious place. Helpful staff. A good array of stained glass. Unwind in silence for a while and on the outside observe the nice architecture.",
          "Another exceptional church integral to the history of Ireland which is a must for any one interested in the history of the country",
          "Lovely church very beautiful. Very helpfull staff. Lovely place well worth a visit. Well maintained. Lovely windows. Easey to find. Nice grounds.",
          "This cathedral is arguably one of the most visually striking in Ireland, rivaling even St. Patricks. There is much rich history to be explored and enjoyed here, and it's a very easy walk from almost anywhere in the city center.",
          "There was a 5 Euro fee, and we were giving a pamphlet regarding the church important features. This is not a difficult Cathedral to located, especially if you have detailed map of Cork with you. We were provided ours at our hotel. There is a map of the statues on the outer",
          "Quite Pretty! The pictures look different so when I got there I had to ask myself if I was in the right place. There are cute grounds around, so you might want to take a picnic.",
          "A truly beautiful church. Definitely worth a visit whilst in Cork. The first female freemason is buried there!",
          "Poor not because of what it is but beacuse of their admission charge. In common with other protestant cathedrals in Ireland, this one has been turned from a House of God into a commerical enterprise with an entry fee. Compare the North Cathedral on the other side of the city,",
          "You will enjoy just strolling around and just looking at the architectural detail... Fab views of Cobb harbour and beyond from the height of the platform around the cathedral.",
          "A 5/10 minute stroll from centre and across the footbridge, this is worth a visit. The area leading to it may not be best place to be later in the day, though. The stained glass windows depict scenes from the Old and New Testaments, while the sanctuary ceiling is worth a zoom",
          "When in Cork you must stop by the cathedral for a visit and photo opportunity. There are also nice views of the cathedral from the river walk",
          "Again another must if you are in Cork. The architecture is stunning and the stained glass windows are amazing. The organ is one of the biggest in the world and again well worth the entrance charge.",
          "beautiful building and surrounding gardens. the inside is also beautiful to see, a must if you come to cork",
          "A very ornate building inside and out which is worth a visit when you are in Cork. Your entry charge includes an informative leaflet so you can do a self guided tour.",
          "We went to a classical concert in this cathedral during our stay in Cork. The concert was brilliant, we walked there easily from the city centre. Worth going to for the architecture and the stained glass windows.",
          "As a Corkonian and I am happy to finally announce that I have visited the most historically important site in the city. The Cathedral itself was interesting, the information sheet they hand out was sufficiently detailed, it didn't take too long to view and left me satisfied that",
          "Impressive view from the front with various graphics and motives decorating the structure. Could not go inside as Sunday mass was on. But overall about 30 min visit here is enough to soak the experience.",
          "The impressive sights begin before you even enter the cathedral. St. Fin Barre's stretches an almost impossible height along the surrounding buildings in Cork, and it looks every bit as imposing and eye-catching today as it had to centuries ago. There are details within details",
          "Gorgeous cathedral and awesome architecture...just a 5 minute walk from the main drag of the Grand Parade it really is a gem of the city!",
          "Much smaller inside than one would expect. Lots of memorials to the fallen in the wars of the Imperial British past. Incongruous in a country that threw off imperial shackles but refreshingly tolerant.",
          "It's impressive, it dominates the city. There is a feeling of darkness...Even with a blue sky, it really appears kind of intimidating. Beautiful!",
          "I walked from my hotel to St. Fin. Very nice area and nice grounds. Makes you feel like you re in the \"Living Years (Mike and the Mechanic) video. Inside of the church was very old school with beautiful stain glass and the nicest staff. Very friendly and worth the visit.",
          "This is a small but impressive cathedral from the outside but appeared closed on Bank Holiday Monday. Might have been our mistake but probably worth checking first if it is open if you are venturing out of the city centre to visit it and the nearby Elizabeth Fort. Pity, bit of",
          "I don't know if we would have visited the cathedral, except that we were looking for things to do on a wet day, but I am glad that we did. The exterior is gloriously Gothic, with an abundance of spires, gargoyles and carved statues. The interior lived up to the promise with",
          "Love the stained glass, the historic building. A very pretty, old church. The engravings on the front are just beautiful.",
          "The outside of this cathedral is very impressive with it's massive gargoyles protecting it from evil spirits and statues carved into the building.",
          "Awe inspiring building inside and out. For a small fee we had a guided tour that was so informative and added so much to the experience. Very impressed with the quantity of the information we were given. Very glad we took the time to explore this Cathedral, worth every minute.",
          "Stunning !!!!!!!! The church is absolutely fantastic and unique!! A place that everyone should visit !!!! ~~~",
          "Beautiful church. Shame it is of the beaten track. Also you have to pay \u00a35.00 to go in. But if you are up to it go for it.",
          "we were told it was possible to go into the cathedral but it was closed when we went............ early evening, we thought that being a cathedral it would have been open until later.",
          "My son in law and his father are named Fin Barre, his father lived most of his life in Coraigh, we couldn't miss this coming from the U.S. Structures such as this are older than my country and simply spectacular pieces of art that have withstood the test of time.",
          "Our group visited this truly special architectural space recently. The touch of William Burges is to be seen in virtually every aspect of this wonderful place. The overall reverence of this cathedral contributes to its role as a center of Christian worship. For those of you",
          "A cathedral has been on this site since 7th century. Present cathedral was consecrated in 1870. Designed by William Burges, an avid follower of 13th century French Gothic architecture, the exterior is a sight to behold - stunning. There is a pipe organ with almost 4000 pipes. 5",
          "A lovely cathedral in Cork Ireland. Unique in its own way and definitely worth visiting if you are in Cork, Ireland",
          "My partner and myself love going to Cobh and especially visiting St Fin Barres Cathedral. It is a most wonderful building full of architecture.",
          "Visited on a clear blue day. St. fin barre's cathedral against a backdrop of clear blue sky was magical. It picked out the marvelous architecture. Looking at both the outside and inside was a pleasure to behold, but we only had a few day to enjoy all the attractions of cork",
          "The inside is not that impressive, but the outside is reasonably imposing. Be sure to note the opening times if you are visiting as a tourist.",
          "Modest price for entry, but the cathedral was beautiful. The stained glass windows were amazing, and the inside of the church was stunning. The guides were very helpful for both the church and the surrounding area.",
          "Take the time to stop in and take it all in. The details and craftsmanship inside and out are marvelous to look at.",
          "Interior is just gorgeous and the grounds are lovely. There's a small gift shop for souvenir purchases. Entry fee gets you a very detailed handout about the history. Overall, worth a stop! If you're disabled and have a tag, pull through the gate and into the lot and park right",
          "This cathedral is OUTSTANDING! I have never seen anything like it! There was too much to even take in! So much detail!! Absolutely beautiful! We were not feeling Cork, but sure glad we made our way to visit this gem.",
          "Beautiful, even if just for the photo opportunities alone! Couldn't get a chance to go inside though!",
          "Would have like more time, but all in all it seemed like a nice place with its Titanic Museum, local bars and cafes.",
          "Not sure it was worth the entrance fee, but lovely cathedral. I liked the decoration round the pulpit area.",
          "Really a recommendation! It was really beautiful inside, we were able to go very near the altar, absolutely worth a visit!",
          "One of my favorite attractions in the City. Fantastic architecture. Look out for the gold angel on top.. The outside of the cathedral is a photographer's paradise.. Tours of the inside can be got too with excellent guides..",
          "The title says it all really. The building is amazing from the outisde but once you get inside it's the same as any other Gothic architecture. It's quite dark inside so unless you're there on a very bright, sunny day it will be difficult to get a good view of the stained glass",
          "This was included i our walking tour of Cork. We didn't enter the Cathedral, but our guide explained the decorative art on the building. It was a fun and fascinating glimpse into Irish history.",
          "Easy to find and plenty to see and photo. Reasonable entry price and consider the shared entry price ticket for that and St Annes Church Bells & tower Shandon in Cork.",
          "Historic and very lovely. Welcoming to visitors. Able to get questions answered and they seemed genuine about enjoying visitors,",
          "Beautiful art, sculpture and mosaics. A really serene and gracious but majestic building. Young, helpful and friendly staff help you make the most of visit to this wonderful cathedral.",

          "This church is perhaps half a mile from Patrick Street. We have some good pictures taken from the outside. We didn't go in because there was a charge to enter the cathedral.",
          "Very unusual and interesting architecture. Was happy to meet a fellow genealogist there to help me further my family research.",
          "never in all my travels have I been required to pay for entry into a place of worship. We were stopped at the door by a young man who trotted out a list of charges... What? To pray? This surely must be a first in any cathedral in the Anglican group. We refused to pay and were",
          "Visited here with my cousin to hear his gorgeous daughter sing in the choir- The Cathedral is very gothic from the outside but calm and serene inside. So proud to hear my 2nd cousin raise us up- the Dean is a great man- ecumenical and inclusive.",
          "I visited St. Fin Barre's as an interested worshipper. The architecture is gloomy Irish gothic chic, but boasts a glorious window. The music is good and the congregation is inclusive. Preaching was so-so (the preacher having begun his sermon by telling us that he wished he",
          "Very beautiful cathedral with ancient graveyard. Beautiful in any weather and any time of the day. Visit it when you are in Cork.",
          "Such a beautiful cathedral. Fantastic stained glass. Pay attention to the brochure or you will miss some interesting details. Then walk the grounds as well",
          "Built in 1870 the cathedral is fairly modern compared to many but no less impressive inside and out. It is worth taking your time to read the pamphlet provided so you don't miss anything. I particularly liked pulpit,the lectern and of course the stained glass windows. The staff",
          "Situated just around the river, this beautiful catherdral is a must-visit in Cork. Not far from the city centre, it is also quite close to the old fort ruins near the cathedral. Get a good bird's eye view of the city from its top point.",
          "If you like the awesomeness and majesty of old Gothic cathedrals this is a must see;well worth the 5 euros they charge. From the moment you set eyes on this mammoth structure with its intricate artwork on the outside, the old tombs, and grave markers to the spectacular interior",
          "Although there was a charge to enter this impressive building, it had many interesting features including mosaics and a painted ceiling over the high altar. The organ was being played when we arrived and we enjoyed the music.",
          "Was here in 2013 and couldn't get in because of a wedding. Came back while passing through Cork and so glad I did. The Cathedral is beautiful inside but what makes the trip if you are any kind of organ buff is all the ranks and specialty pipes that are right down on the floor",
          "St. Fin Barre is the patron of Cork nad gives his name to this cathedral. In about 1536 during the Protestant Reformation, the cathedral become part of the established Church. in 1864 the existing small cathedral was demolished and the present magnificent structure was built in",
          "Pesimo que en una catedral de culto te cobren 5\u20ac y no te entreguen ni recibo o tiquet. Outrageous that a place of faith would charge you 5 \u20ac and won't give you a ticket or even a receipt.",

          "A truly magnificent cathedral. Beautiful architecture and a great place to visit when visiting Cork.",

          "Guided tour, beautiful architecture, convenient location, near city centre, a lot of history attached to this cathedral.",
          "What a special Place. Visited here when in Cork recently. Beautiful cathedral in the city centre & must see if in Cork.",
          "We walked past this incredibly beautiful cathedral twice daily to and from our hotel in our wanderings around Cork. I saw another review that said it looked a bit like Notre Dame. Having not visited Notre Dame yet, I couldn't say, but it is beautiful. We toured the beautiful",
          "If you get the chance, you should visit this wonderful cathedral. Looking a bit like Notre Dame from a distance, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a much older building. In fact late 19th century and designed by William Burges, who also had a great deal if influence on",
          "This cathedral is gorgeous, and in a convenient location to go and visit even if you only have a short amount of time to act like a tourist! (as was our case, as we were there on business) The gentleman that worked in the cathedral gave us a mini-tour of the cathedral and",
          "Was very impressed by the stained glass in particular. The organ was fascinating and like nothing else I have seen. The guide Gus was superb and made the whole experience even better",
          "A beautiful cathedral inside and out. On this rainy Saturday afternoon, the place was nearly empty, making for a peaceful, serene experience. Wonderful stained glass. Very pleasant older couple manning the door. Unlike some other posters here, I'm happy to pay 5 euro for a walk",
          "Stunning exterior to the cathedral. Well worth seeing if in the area. Nice surrounding gardens and a generally pleasant atmosphere We saw 2 people walk inside then quickly walk out. We then did exactly the same thing when we saw that they were charging \u20ac5 to see the interior.",
          "The cathedral is stunning from the outside with great photo opportunities. This is a fee paying attraction and in my opinion the fees would have been worth it if there was a tour (similar to St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin) to explain the various features of the place.",

        "wiki": "Blackrock Castle is a castellated fortification located at Blackrock, about 2 km from Cork city centre on the banks of the River Lee in Ireland. Originally developed as a coastal defence fortification in the 16th century to protect upper Cork Harbour and port, the site now houses an observatory, visitor centre and restaurant.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 16th century, the citizens of Cork appealed to Queen Elizabeth I to construct a fort at Blackrock to \"repel pirates and other invaders\". In 1582 a fortification was built on the site, and later around 1600, a round tower was constructed to safeguard against pirates \"carrying away\" vessels entering the harbour. The earliest elements of this structure remaining today are a circular tower on the water's edge, 10.5m in diameter, with walls 2.2m thick.\nBlackrock Castle was in the ownership of the City of Cork following a charter of James I to the city in 1608. The castle is later referred to in the Council Book of Cork in 1613 and 1614. In 1722 the old four-storey tower was destroyed by fire and new one built by the citizens, costing \u00a3296.\nThroughout this period, the castle was used by Cork Corporation for banquets and \"convivial gatherings\" - some associated with the custom of \"throwing the dart\". This custom, dating to at least the 18th century, was held every three years in August, and involved a dart (an arrow about four feet long) being thrown by the Mayor from a boat, to indicate the Corporation's jurisdiction over the harbour.Following a banquet, the castle was destroyed by fire in 1827. The rebuilding began at the direction of Mayor Thomas Dunscombe in 1828 and was completed in March 1829. The architects added three additional storeys to the original tower and rebuilt the out-buildings. The new building cost the City of Cork \u00a31,000. The architects were George Richard Pain and James Pain, who were responsible for other public buildings around Cork at the time. The neo-gothic complex of buildings around a courtyard is essentially what remains today.\nThe castle entered private hands and for a time in the 20th century was used as a private residence, offices, rowing club headquarters, and restaurant. The building was reacquired by Cork Corporation in 2001, and work commenced on renovating and re-purposing the complex as an observatory and museum.\n\n\n== Observatory ==\nIn the early-2000s, Blackrock Castle was redeveloped under a joint venture between Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology and a private benefactor.Opened in 2007, the \"Cosmos at the Castle\" project was intended to create a \"centre for scientific research, outreach and communication\". The castle's observatory houses an interactive astronomy center which is open to the public, and has exhibits including a \"tour of the universe\" and a radio telescope that beams messages composed by school groups towards nearby stars.The castle also houses labs staffed by astronomical researchers from Cork Institute of Technology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlackrock Castle Observatory",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Blackrock Castle Observatory. Our tour guide was fun and he told us many stories of the most unusual history of the castle. You can take stairs down to the dungeon where there is a cannon that once could have warded off attackers. You can",
          "Its a planetarium! In a castle! The restaurant here is delicious. I kind of loved this place and my 7 year old totally loved it too. The young man that gave us the castle and planetarium tour was patient and kind and informative. The beer I drank in what looked like a castle",

          "For us, Blackrock Castle was hyped as an observatory but it wasn\u2019t worth our time or the \u20ac6. Now perhaps this is because they were running a science camp the day we were driving thru Cork. Nonetheless we were all disappointed as we got to see very little. Likely a better place",

          "Visited this site back in 2012, and it was a really beautiful day in September. Didn't go in though - I believe it was closed. The castle used to be a form of a fort in the 1600s, and you can see it is situated right on the River Lee!",

          "Definitely one to do - great interactive experience for young and old. Staff are exceptionally friendly. The tour guide was very informative and would recommend both the castle and planetarium tours. My 5 year old loved it. The attached restaurant is very good too.",
          "The castle is part cafe, part observatory, part history lesson. There is a nice walking loop that the castle sits on. They put on great science camps for kids during the breaks, but they book up fast. The tour of the observatory is interesting, as it provides some facts about",
          "I went in with low expectations. It's a Castle after all and we have all been in castles. This was something else. It is an observatory. And the guide have an excellent account of the history of the castle along with a show on the planets. We went there with an hour and a half",
          "A fantastic 2 hours of pleasure, overpriced restaurant but the exhibition and tour is well worth the reasonable entry price, the time flew , brilliant collection of space voyages badge's. Good tour guide and friendly staff",

          "Interesting, educational but a lot smaller than we had imagined. The hands on learning displays were excellent and the best feature was the inflatable planetarium. All of our group were fascinated",
          "Tour lasts approximately an hour. Starts with a discussion about a fire place which is unrelated to the castle. Followed by an 85 step climb to the top of the tower. After this you climb down 100 steps to a cannon room where children have the opportunity to fire a fake",

          "I didn't know what to expect as Ireland is hardly the world leader in space but boy was I impressed. They pack a lot into this small space and the interactive exhibits are great at engaging kids. The staff were lovely and really knowledgeable.",
          "This is primarily a science themed facility but in an unusual building. The castle is a genuine castle building dating back to the 17th century, designed to protect the harbour with canon. There are a number of audio-visual displays which are mainly physics and space related. A",

          "I loved my recent visit to Blackrock Castle, it has amazing views from the Observatory. We had lunch outside and service was very quick and the food was really lovely. If you're having a dessert, ask for the trifle, you won't regret it!",
          "We went to the CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory thinking we were headed to a sprawling castle. When we arrived we realized that it is an observatory - just as described. We all had a laugh when we got here because we thought it would be...Bigger. It's a small building on the",
          "The castle is situated on the bank of the river Lee and played important role long time ago. it is a great view on the river from the castle. The observatory is in the castle. It definitely must be seen if you visit Cork.",

          "This small, ancient castle on the banks of the River Lee has been repurposed into an observatory/science center on one side and a cafe on the other, with a lovely courtyard between the two. The observatory has some very basic science exhibits that we perused in about 15",
          "We were surprised to see that this was an actual observatory but, the history and our very well spoken tour guide made this a very interesting stop.",
          "The receptionist said she was holding me to the 5 star review I promised so here it is! The tour was AMAZING! Our guide was very spunky and clearly showed working there is a fun experience! The interactive videos were also very fun and we greatly enjoyed our 2 hours here! Worth",

          "We stopped on our way into Cork to check out the castle, we originally had no idea it was an observatory. When we came there was very little for crowds so we had a private planetarium viewing and it was awesome. The way the skyline was explained was probably meant for kids, but",
          "We came here as we saw it was a small castle so thought it was very cute. The history behind the castle is very interesting. The fact that it's been converted into an observatory makes it even better! We went to a planetarium show and straight after had a guided tour of the",
          "Beautiful place on the river interesting and very popular bus takes you there good value for money interesting part of cork even from the old days",

          "This was a spontaneous adventure with friends on a Saturday afternoon. For 6.50 you get to learn a little about space and to climb to the top of the castle to see a beautiful view of the port and upriver to Cork city. Definitely worth a visit!",

          "Beautiful Views of Cork and River Lee. Lovely place to come for with Family. Nice Restaurant here. And a Bar. I see it popular for Wedding Photos. Bring a Camera with you here. Great for kids interest in the Stars and Planets. Great place \u2026",

          "Great walkway",
          "Tiny but loved the planetarium show",
          "Great for a short stop if you are doing other things in the area. The bonus of Black Rock is that it isn't just a castle. There is also a planetarium at the site. I wouldn't say it is a must-see, but still a fun stop.",
          "Black haired geeza is a bit of a knob",
          "Awesome place but the only problem is it has no wheelchair or buggy access around the castle",
          "Great way to spend a few hours. Beautiful castle with interactive displays that offer both science & history in a fun & interesting way. Amazingly knowledgeable & engaging tour guide & very friendly staff. Plenty of free parking & very clean. Highly reccomend.",
          "Don't go at weekends when the weather is okay. Lots of families visit the castle and its restaurant and the adjoining Mahom walk. Its far too noisy with scrraming uncontrolled kids. Go during the week",
          "Tiny disorganized mess. Not worth the 7\u20ac.\nFour screens with some scientific videos and three photos about the moon landing. The only way to go up the tower is with the tour, once an hour, they crammed over 50 people in it, total disgrace. \u2026",
          "Super nice and friendy employees, had fun when I was there. The view is amazing from the top, worth going there.",
          "Great place ! Totally recommend! Nice cafe too!",

          "Great place to visit.Built for defence Cork port,now observatory.Lovely walk along river Lee and Lake Mahon.",
          "This was a very neat experience! A castle turned into an observatory, pretty cool! Our guide was very knowledgeable! She led us through the planetarium portion as well as through the basement and the roof! The rest is self guided! Highly recommend!",
          "If you're wanting a historic tour, this is not the place for you. However, if you want a neat educational experience in a uniquely stunning building, you will not be disappointed.  Learn about our universe, and explore a castle. Win win.",

          "I was very impressed with Blackrock Castle Observatory. Great background story about the  evolution of this building, which was told very well be a real enthusiastic tour guide. Fantastic interactive displays about astronomy, evolution, Big Bang etc. Great Cafe too. Excellent overall.",
          "Good use of a castle. Guide was very informative and engaging",
          "Excellent science center set in the old castle",
          "Interesting visit, but Planetarium needs more thought for old folks (or at least a warning!)",
          "This place is well worth a visit whether you are a tourist or just have never taken the time to explore this historic location.  The observatory is housed in a landmark castle that goes back to the sixteenth century.  The castle, I believe, \u2026",
          "Brilliant food and excellent service. Their homemade pink lemonade is something to go back for time and time again",
          "Lovely tours and interesting facts, but it could do with some updating",
          "Fantastic learning centre for adults and children alike. So much about space, the Big Bang, astronomy, magnetic energy etc. The Observatory was class (out if use in the day due to weather conditions, it's Ireland so don't be disappointed). \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. 3 parkings and free toilet",
          "Excellent tour and very informative. Highly recommend it. Great views from the top",
          "Absolutely  brilliant.  Had interest going in, was dragged by my missus and 5 mins in I was in my element. \nDisappointed in cafe not opening on monday. It was warm and I needed a drink. \nShop needs more adult merch like shirts \n\nView from top alone worth it. It was cool",
          "A great experience. Very informative and enthusiastic staff provided a great tour of the castle and planetarium.\nHad dinner in the adjacent restaurant which was very friendly with amazing food.",

          "Because it's about space and all the fun that all my family did",
          "A little apprehensive going into this we ended up pleasantly surprised by how fun and informatative this was. We'll worth it just to get to the top and see the view.\nWhile waiting for tours to start there are interactive tvs and activities. \u2026",

          "Awesome guided tour with an extremely knowledgeable astrologer. The planetarium experience was outstanding and enjoyed learning about the history of the building. Highly recommended for all ages. Thanks again",
          "Underwhelming experience, not much to do for young kids. Too many project displays with movies to watch and not enough engaging science experiments. Observatory part is a blown up tent, very claustrophobic and super unimpressive. \n\nNot worth the money at all!!",
          "You have to take a tour. However, the guide we had was highly interesting. \nIncluding tour we spent an hour.",

          "Friendly accessible science with great views over the harbour!",
          "Cute bit of local history sprinkled with some science facts. Not many exhibits, mostly video, but the staff were amazing and the cute mini planetarium show was adorable. The view from the top of the turret is worth climbing the 100 stone stairs to reach it.",
          "Really nice place, good view and good to learn.",

          "Amazing place been there multiple times already and I can't get enough of it.",
          "The castle and visitor centre are more compact than I expected. Good view over the river from the top of the tower, although I would say  the tour isn't suitable for many younger kids as they have to be watched closely and may get bored. \u2026",
          "A lovely place to spend a few hours specially if the weather is nice.",
          "Really friendly staff, very pretty castle.",

          "Had a reasonable experience here with a talk on astronomy, followed by a short climb up to the observatory (only on official tour).\n\nOur guide made the tour fun with some dry humor, probably because he does these tours 5 times a day.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "Went to the cafe in the castle for brunch on a Sunday a number of weeks ago. Great service, staff, and location. The menu was fairly limited at the time but that didn't take from our enjoyment of it. Parking is a bit lacking but there's a large car park around the corner towards Mahon.",
          "Not what you would expect: the castle holds a science exhibition inside, with a focus on astronomy. The tour gives you information about the history of the castle and offers a planetarium show at the end. Lots of information about space in general and very interactive. Great place especially with kids.",

        "wiki": "The English Market (Irish: An Margadh Sasanach) is a municipal food market in the center of Cork city, Ireland. It stretches from Princes Street to the Grand Parade, and combines Princes Street Market and Grand Parade Market. The market is regarded for both its mid-19th century architecture and locally produced artisan food. \nThe market has become a tourist attraction, has developed an international reputation, and has been described by chef Rick Stein as the \"best covered market in the UK and Ireland\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe term English Market was coined in the 19th century to distinguish the market from the nearby St. Peter's Market (now the site of the Bodega on Cornmarket Street), which was known as the Irish Market. There has been a market on the present site since 1788 when it was opened as a meat shambles and known as \"new markets\". Its original structure is entirely lost. The market has been rebuilt in stages, including by John Benson and Robert Walker in the mid-19th century who constructed a front range, galleried court, and extended the footprint to the south end of Princes Street. Today the market centers around a cast iron fountain,  and is typically entered via either a tripartite facade on Princes Street, or a bayed entrance from the Grand Parade. The market is known for its interior; which consists of a gabled central bay, central archways, and stained glass lunette windows. It was damaged during a 1981 fire, but is now fully restored.Today's group of buildings were constructed in the mid-19th century with the ornamental entrance at Princes Street being constructed in 1862 by Sir John Benson. The market changed little over the next century or so until it was seriously damaged by fire on 19 June 1980 and had to be extensively refurbished by Cork City Council. The refurbishment work was done in sympathy with the original Victorian building's design and won a Gold Medal from the Europa Nostra heritage foundation for conservation shortly after its completion. The refurbished market suffered a second fire in 1986 but the fire was less damaging than the first.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nIt is administered by Cork City Council. Since its refurbishment the market has become more multicultural, and a variety of fresh produce from around the world can be bought there. The market is still best known however for its fresh fish and butchers, and it serves many of the city's top restaurants. It is a source of local specialities such as drisheen, spiced beef, and buttered eggs.Queen Elizabeth II visited the market during her state visit to Ireland in 2011. Charles, Prince of Wales also stopped there during his visit in 2018. Both were served by fishmonger Pat O'Connell. In 2016 and 2017, the English Market was used as a location for the film The Young Offenders and the subsequent TV series of the same name.Cork City Council and the site's traders commended the market's 230th anniversary in August 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The first introduction to this market was when I tried to get a picture in front of the Stephen\u2019s Meat Market and was immediately scolded.

          "Every time we're in Cork we visit the English Market. It is an indoor market of an old fashioned style with stalls close together but spotlessly clean. This is where the Queen of England visited a couple of years ago. \"And what kind of fish is that?\"she asked a fishmonger. \"Well",
          "We are fans of Markets and the English Market in Cork is about as good as they come. Bakeries, Butchers, Seafood, fresh produce were all well represented and artfully displayed. There is also a nice informal restaurant upstairs.",

          "Small, not having the old cast steel interior you sometimes can find at these old sheltered markets. The shops are nice, the floor with typically colored tiles are nice as well, but the ceiling has been renovated in the past (probably the 70's?) in a cheap way. Everybody",
          "After visiting the cathedral, the fort and the excellent Nano Nagle museum we headed back across the bridge into the main part of the city and to find somewhere to eat. Interesting market with many varied foodstuff, ideas for meals and also some chocolate's bought as present's",

          "I\u2019d heard a lot about the English Market, it was worth a visit. Not exactly what I expected though. Interesting but smaller than I thought. You do get to see the traders going about their business up close and there are some good photo opportunities.",
          "This place is truly amazing. You will always find the ingredients you\u2019re looking for. My personal favourite is the cheese section where you can select the type and amount of cheese you need. Which comes handy when making a cheese board and wouldn\u2019t necessarily need large",
          "I\u2019ve been to Redding station in Philly as well as many other similar markets. While this one had less prepared food to eat on the spot, it did offer quite a wide variety of meats and fish. I was quite surprised by the low prices for many of the products. Definitely worth the",

          "Lots of food, cooked and processed as well as fresh including fish and butchered meats along with restaurants and small coffee shops is mostly what one finds here. Interesting and one can while away time and enjoy, but it is a bit overrated. Anyways, if in Cork, go for a stroll",
          "Fun to walk around and we ate lunch at the cafe there, which was great. Only 4 stars because more applicable to those who are buying ultra fresh ingredients to cook, not as much for those staying at hotels. Still enjoyed!",

          "Loved the variety at the English Market! From fresh sea food and beef to chocolates, breads, etc. Something for everyone. It reminds me of Pikes Fish Market in Seattle. If we were staying at a place that had a kitchen I definitely would have shopped there.",

          "You can find something for everyone's tastes at this market! We took home some fresh vegetables and lovely sea scallops from different vendors for dinner. But you can find everything: fresh cheeses and dairy, butchers a-plenty, Asian foods, and so much more. We also had a nice",

          "Cruise ship stop and did a walking exploration through central Cork. The English market is as the name says a mixed market for the locals. Butchers, fish mongers, bakers and many others. Not a market for tourists unless you like to see where locals shop. Good if you have time",
          "This is definitely worth a visit while in the center of Cork. The entrances are pretty non-descript and small, but the shopping inside is really great. The bakery options were great (we tried a couple of different ones), but there is pretty much everything you could want. There",
          "When we arrived in Cork, we walked the city to make a list of the places we'd like to stop for a pint and food. On that walk was the English Market. This has everything a local needs to prepare daily meals at home. For the traveler, it's a great place to sample local food,",

          "The English market is amazing. You can buy the freshest fish, meat and vegetables. Plus a Cork tradional food like Spiced beef from Tom Durkin or delicious homemade pate and cheeses from On the Pigs back store. Not to amazing chocolates from the chocolate shop. If your hungry",

          "This is a great market. Our only regret was that we weren't staying in a house that we could cook up a feast in. Fantastic seafood, meat, cheese and olives. We bought lots of nibbly bits as we wandered around and had snacks in the car on the trip back to to Dublin. Go early",

          "Underwhelming food market stalls that are exactly the same in every country. Definitely not worth the hassle of finding or paying for parking Expect to find fish, meat, bread, jams and chocolate. The same as you can find in a grocery store and pay 20 cents to use the restrooms",
          "We stopped by on a weekday around lunch time. Parking was difficult, as we had to park in a very tight pay parking garage near the market. We walked thru The English Market and enjoyed looking at all of the food - most of the food was not prepared and ready to eat. So, if",

          "I have visited before, though it\u2019s stiill a great place and lovely fresh produce I can\u2019t help feeling it\u2019s lost a bit of its magic! The displays of goods used to be spectacular- but not so now in my opinion! Still worth a visit though!",
          "The charm of this place is hard to appreciate as a tourist because it's a true and functional market. If I am staying in Cork for a while, I would love to come shopping here everyday for my kitchen.",

          "Looked up this place before we visited and it is exactly what it is! It\u2019s a giant market with lots of fresh meat markets. It ms more suitable for local people that can bring their meat home to cook, not suitable for tourists at all!",

Just loads to see and buy, all fresh produce and the staff gave loads of advice on how to cook things or what to eat them with. If you\u2019re in the city, drop",

The park is located on the Mardyke and is a short distance from Cork city centre and University College Cork.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was originally the site of the 1902 Cork International Exhibition, a world's fair showcasing the city's economy. After the exhibition the grounds were converted into a public park, with a large pond and fountain as the main focus. The park was named for Edward Fitzgerald, the then incumbent Lord Mayor of Cork and proposer of the Cork Internation Exhibition.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nThe park is approximately 12 acres in size and contains a pond, the Cork Public Museum, sculpture trail, bandstand, a caf\u00e9 and a large children's play area. The area of the park is joined to Sunday's Well across the River Lee by Daly's bridge (a pedestrian suspension bridge known locally as the \"Shakey Bridge\").\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Crawford Art Gallery (Irish: \u00c1il\u00e9ar Crawford) is a public art gallery and museum in the city of Cork, Ireland. Known informally as the Crawford, it was designated a 'National Cultural Institution' in 2006. It is \"dedicated to the visual arts, both historic and contemporary\", and welcomed 265,438 visitors in 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Crawford is based in the centre of Cork in what used to be the Cork Customs House, built in 1724. The Customs House became home to the Royal Cork Institution (RCI) in the 1830s, and the RCI was involved in opening the Cork School of Design on the site in 1850. In the early 1880s, the Cork School of Design was extended with funds and patronage from members of the Crawford family, who were local landowners and brewers. For this reason the school was renamed as the Crawford School of Art in 1885. In 1979, the art school transferred to another site, and the Crawford building used primarily as a gallery and museum. The museum buildings were substantially extended in 2000.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nAmong the earliest acquisitions in the gallery's collection are casts of classical Greek and Roman statues by Antonio Canova. These were brought to Cork from the Vatican in 1818. The Royal Cork Institution acquired these works from the Society of Fine Arts in Cork, who had been given the casts by the Prince Regent (later George IV of the United Kingdom). He in turn had received them from Pope Pius VII, who had commissioned Antonio Canova to make a set of plasters from statues in the Vatican.\nDue to the gallery's association with the Cork School of Art (later known as the Crawford College of Art and Design), some items in the museum collection are by staff and students of the school. These include works by James Brenan (who was headmaster of the school from 1860 to 1889) and students such as Henry Jones Thaddeus and William Gerard Barry.Other items in the collection include works by sculptors such as John Hogan and Eilis O'Connell, stained-glass artists like Harry Clarke and Evie Hone, painters including William Orpen (a student of James Brenan), Jack B. Yeats, and Nano Reid, as well as photographer Bob Carlos Clarke.The gallery hosts education and outreach programmes, and manages temporary and travelling exhibitions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoyal Cork Institution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrawford Art Gallery website",

          "As a local I must say this art gallery is a venue I return to again and again. Not only is the space vast and varied but the location is ideal for anyone who is just taking a walk around the city. One of the highlights that Cork has to offer.",
          "Love to walk around here for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are alway interesting exhibits. Often there is an audiovisual exhibit upstairs. The cafe downstairs is a lovely place for breakfast, lunch or just coffee and cake.",
          "This is a very nice art gallery, admission is free and there are some very beautiful paintings. But after a while it gets a bit boring, most of the paintings are just the same thing over and over again. Never the less, the exhibition that was on about stain glass was lovely. I",
          "An absolutely fabulous place to visit.Fantastic collection of art extremely well curated.Nice restaurant on the ground floor.Admission is free but donations are most welcome Could and do spend hours here",
          "Well worth a visit with great exabitions and the food in the resteraunt was very good. Could have spent all day in the gallery",
          "If you have an hour or two to spare in Cork city, the Crawford Art Gallery is a great place to visit, ful of paintings and sculptures on a few floors,and when you are done, you can have a delicious coffee and cake or lunch. Well worth visiting, and it has free entry to the",

          "The Crawford Art gallery was well worth a look to see the history of art in Cork. The staff were so friendly, sharing stories of the art works they loved and a history of Cork. It was great to see auch enthusiasm. We loved it so much we went back twice.",
          "Came here on the way to see Blarney Castle, really glad we popped in as the collections are really beautiful. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "It was a cold, cloudy and gloomy day in Cork (even though our weather report claimed it would be sunny today). Things were going so great for the most part, and after relaxing a bit in a nice hot cocoa/ coffee cafe, I learned about the Crawford Gallery and some locals",
          "This is an amazing place to visit because the building itself is very historic, being the former Customs House which was built in 1724. It is also the home of a wide range of art treasures and is well worth visiting.",
          "Lovely building ideally located in the city centre, I've been visiting the Crawford for a long time now and I always enjoy it. The gallery seriously needs updating though, feels like it hasn't changed in years! Cafe is enjoyable but service is so so.",
          "Permier art gallery in cork - there is a coffee shop in the gallery and it's right beside the Cork Opera House.",
          "I spent a great day visiting the Crawford Gallery in Cork. The works of art range from lesser known regional artists to rockstars like David Hockney, encompassing exhibits from over a handful of centuries ago until now. Even without those, the beautiful building itself is",
          "The gallery is very impressive and boasts a wide range of artists and styles. The caf\u00e9 on the ground floor is superb. Highly recommend breakfast in the caf\u00e9 and then a stroll around the beautiful gallery.",
          "I felt surrounded by history and the real Cork character, a highly well-spent afternoon. The staff were great and went out of their way to show me around to the different artists and paintings.",
          "A medium sized gallery, but very representative of all that is good in Irish art. Special exhibitions are mounted regularly and admission is free. There is a very good restaurant in the gallery. A visit is highly recommended",

          "The building itself is great. And when we had a question staff was helpful. However, we would have liked a bit more text and information/explanation with the displays. As it was now, it looked a bit disjointed - a group of statues, a group of nineteenth century paintings, some",
          "I visited here on an afternoon recently and had lunch in the caf\u00e9 as a little treat which was very nice. In the gallery, I was disappointed to find that one of my favourite paintings 'Men of the South' by Sean Keating was not on display. I hope it was just down for cleaning, and",
          "The gallery is spacious and well laid out, particularly the temporary exhibition. However, whoever labelled the latter doesn't know their right from left and there was a dreadfully large number of typos in the permanent labels.",
          "This gallery has a permanent collection of over 3000 works including a Sculpture gallery showing neo-classical and classical pieces. Many Irish artists have works displayed including J B Yates, Walter Osborne, Edith Somerville and others. There is a bookshop and caf\u00e9. A couple",

          "Very impressed, this is well worth a visit by anyone to the city. We were all very impressed. This is a great facility in Cork city and for both young and old alike. Both educational and if you do appreciate art. You have so much to choose from you could visit a couple times to",
          "A bit hit and miss with the quality of art, but always nice to have a browse and a wander through here when I'm in the city. Cafe is lovely, but a bit expensive!",

          "Amazing gallery/art museum in the heart of Cork city, hosting both contemporary and historical. Every time I visited you will experience a new cultural highlight! Beautiful cafe on the ground level too!",
          "This was my favorite part of Cork City, besides the traditional Irish music at Sin E. Unexpected sculpture gallery, and the Irish Arts and Crafts exhibit was really great...from lace-making to furniture to Celtic designs in metal. The cafe there had WONDERFUL food--my spinach",
          "I really appreciate Ireland having fee art galleries and museums. I am glad that people get to enjoy these types of things no matter who they are. It is also nice for tourists such as myself. Just because I am on vacation doesn't mean that I have unlimited money to spend. I",
          "Mostly 19th and 20th century paintings by Irish and British artists. Very interesting sculpture section.",
          "I enjoy visiting The Crawford for many reasons. After a cultural tour of the Arts, I love spending time over brunch or lunch in their Cafe. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly and of course, the food is delicious. I take pride in sharing this experience with my",
          "I enjoyed viewing the works at the museum. Was sorry to miss an upcoming exhibit but really, really enjoyed what they have on display. As you know, with most museums, they have vast works that are never on display - but what I liked about the Crawford was that on the top floor",
          "We visited for brunch and a gallery wander. It is something I cannot recommend doing enough whether you live in Cork or are visiting. The quality of the food, service and over all atmosphere of the cafe is incredible. If this was London you would be paying double the price,",
          "We visited on 29 October on a Saturday morning. What a lovely gallery. It catered for all tastes and with scultures and paintings there was sonething for all. Lots of space to view. The cafe is also excellent and a must visit.",
          "The gallery is in a great location and we enjoyed the artwork. I was impressed with the sculptures but was most taken with the portraits hanging in the main hall. From photography to graphite drawings to acrylic paintings, I thought they were the jewels of the gallery. The gift",
          "This space is beautiful, and the fact that is a free venture around many floors art from various styles makes it well worth stopping in. Everything from 1916 commemorative pieces (with placards to teach you a bit about their significance) to modern displays created by young",
          "While strolling around Cork we went into the Crawford gallery cafe. Its a busy place particularly as they serve a first rate breakfast and lunch We just went for tea this time which was served in lovely china ware. The large portions of beautiful coffee cake were",
          "The Crawford Gallery exhibits the collections of the Crawford School of Fine Art, and should probably be viewed in this light. The highlight is really the architecture of the building itself, previously Cork's Customs House, built in 1724. Don't expect too much from this",
          "A poorly curated and jumbled display of mostly mediocre artworks. Little information available about the works or the gallery. To be fair, some sections were being refurbished but no attempt was made to explain this. Staff did not engage with visitors. Building attractive on the",
          "During a quick stop in Cork, I stumbled across the Crawford Gallery. While the artwork on display was thought-provoking and varied, I was most impressed with the workshops happening at the time of my visit. The Gallery is doing some excellent work with physically and mentally",
          "Love the gallery. Beautiful pieces. Security guys, however, are rude and unfriendly! 2 floors. One lift (which is needed) . At the moment some work is being done so the main stairs are not accessible and the toilets are on the second floor.",
          "There's a joke told in cork that an intellectual is someone who goes into the Crawford Gallery when it's not even raining :). A wonderfully eclectic mix of art forms including a HARRY CLARKE stained glass section. a wonderful way to spend a quiet afternoon with a top-class",
          "We love galleries and the Crawford offers a good range of different art to view. The only disappointment was as seniors , the lift was not working and as it covers 3 floors with toilets on the top floor it was quite a struggle to get around. For a main attraction that needs",
          "The building is lovely and the all exhibition is interesting. You'll find lovely art pieces in this art gallery. A little gem in Cork. It's definitely worth the visit and it's free, so no excuses. A nice activity with or without kids.",

          "The museum is walking distance from the English market. It has sculptures, oil paintings, sketches and watercolours from many periods in history. The building itself is incredibly beautiful inside and outside. The rooms are well-decorated, even the grand staircase makes for a",
          "Just a hop and a skip from the centre of Coak City, this gallery is worth checking out. Ground floor has old sculptures and a bustling cafe, and the next floors were great too. Was viewing a project which a family friend was involved in. Good little gift shop there and helpful,",
          "Every art gallery has its own character and the Crawford stands out for being eclectic in its choice of exhibition, and having an easygoing atmosphere. I have brought dozens of groups of visitors to this gallery which is on three floors. Most left expressing positive opinions.",
          "It was a nice visit, especially for a free museum, but sadly, there is not enough context or guidance provided. The \"Contrasting visions\" exhibition about 1916 in particular lacked explanations, especially for an international audience who is not familiar with all these people",
          "A super free facility with interesting standing exhibitions and a broad variety of seasonal ones catering for a variety of tastes and interests. One to add to the list when visiting Cork.",
          "This gallery is great for a free, municipal collection. The range of work is good, and the information on certain key Irish pieces is worth stopping to read. Recommend a visit if you're in Cork. I'm also told the cafe has great cakes, although they were closing when we arrived.",
          "Tasty food, fast service, beauty place, child friendly. In the other hand, noisly, small tables, narrow, ...",
          "The gallery is open during the week and Saturday it is also open till 8pm on Thursdays. There is a lovely staircase and nice pieces of art to see on the second floor. There is a little bit on the history of the building and on William Crawford. Its worth seeing if you are in the",
          "A lovely building just off Cork's main street, it houses an interesting selection of paintings, both old and new. Free entrance and worth a visit, particularly on a rainy day. There's a nice cafe on the ground floor, serving home made food.",
          "You don't have to be an 'arty' person to wander about this gallery. This wonderful gallery is in a very nice part of town. Entry is free too which makes it ideal to pass the time or go see an exhibition.",
          "This gallery is very nice, always quiet, with a great range of art. The old to modern architecture alone is beautiful. Very nice cafe, too.",
          "The art gallery is in a wonderfully restored building in the centre of the city. There are various exhibits ranging from sculptures, furniture, ceramics, glassware to paintings. Some galleries were dedicated to the Somme WWI, the Irish Uprising 1916, the potato famine,",
          "Nice selection of paintings and other art in a classy old building that is well maintained. And its free to visit. The cafe serves tea in crockery pots made with loose leaf Barrys tea and china cups. Pleasant and cheerful staff. A relic of old decency.",
          "Lovely selection of Jack Yeats and some fantastic sculptures. The Museum also has a cafe to rest and eat during your busy day. Warning: Asthma sufferers beware, there is some musty smell, especially in the upper story--maybe a roof leak?",
          "If you don't like the art, it's worth going for the cafe. It's run by Ballymaloe and is really wholesome and excellent. The gallery is worth a browse. Apart from an extensive permanent collection, it frequently runs shows by emerging artists. Always worth a look.",
          "They have done a superb job updating this gallerie. But I found the content a little disapointing. The top floor had the staff selection which I enjoyed",
          "take time out from cork city in this mecca of art. very well laid out over three floors, there is a vast array of art and scultors here. always an exhibition or two are in place and the stain glass exhibit on its own is worth the visit. great cafe here also so take a visit in",

          "Wonderful building and superb exhibition space and galleries. There were some interesting paintings and other exhibits but, I have to say, that I felt the content was, overall, rather thin on the ground, even for a provincial gallery. Wouldn't come near the top of my 'things to",
          "The Crawford Art Gallery is conveniently situated in the heart of the city center so is easily accessible. On the first floor is the sculpture gallery containing works from the 18th, 19th and 20th century - among them works from John Hogan. Also on display are wall plaques from",

          "Adam Buck was a Cork Man who made it big in London 200 years ago. There's an exhibition here of his work - worth a detour! But the other works in the galleries are tops. 2 Ramsays and Yeats - excellent and easily accessible upstairs.",
          "This is located just off of the main shopping street (Patrick's Street), and along the river a little way. It is just round the corner from Cork Opera House. I think it is free to get in, as far as I remember, and it now has a nice caf\u00e9 inside. It's nice for a free activity",

          "It's amazing how few people go to this gallery. Like many, it's under-stated and doesn't have a huge advertising budget. I sometimes pop in when passing, just to take ten minutes or so for a look around, or longer for a coffee in its cafe. Like the gallery, the cafe is",
          "Some good shows to be seen in a welcoming gallery with informed and friendly staff. But you don't have to see art, just go to the caf\u00e9. A short stay in Cork this became the breakfast, morning coffee venue of choice. The staff only have to see you a couple of times to welcome you",

          "This museum surpasses by far the mere, lacklustre of the Lewis Glucksman Gallery in UCC. It has so much quality exhibits. Ranging from the Greco-Roman sculptures on the ground floor to the numerous oil canvas paintings. It also not just focuses on Irish Art, but there are quite",

        "wiki": "Elizabeth Fort is a 17th-century star fort off Barrack Street in Cork, Ireland. Originally built as a defensive fortification on high-ground outside the city walls, the city eventually grew around the fort, and it took on various other roles \u2013 including use as a military barracks, prison, and police station. Since 2014, the fort has seen some development as a tourism heritage site, reportedly attracting 36,000 visitors during 2015. The walls of the fort have been accessible to the public on a regular basis since September 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\nElizabeth Fort was first built in 1601 on a hill to the south and outside the medieval walls of Cork. This position was chosen because, while the city had relied on Shandon Castle and the city walls for defence since Anglo-Norman times, the development of artillery and the possibility of its deployment on the hills surrounding the city, diminished the potential effectiveness of these defences. The fort was built by Sir George Carew and named after Queen Elizabeth I.This original fort was built of timber and earth, and within a few years was pulled down by the citizens of Cork. Fearing that the fort might be used against them by James I during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the mayor and people of Cork demolished the fort in 1603. Cork was retaken however by Lord Mountjoy and the fort was rebuilt.This early construction took place on the site of an existing church. This Hiberno-Norman-period church dated from at least the High Middle Ages and appears in documents and maps as \"St Mary del Nard\" (1199), or \"Holy Cross del Nard\" (1311). In John Speed's map of Cork (1610) \"Holy Roe\" church is marked within the walls of the (then) newly finished fort.\n\nThe basic structure of the current fort has its basis in reconstructions dating from 1624 to 1626, and in works reputedly carried out under Cromwell in 1649. Any remnants of the previous church were removed in these reconstructions.In 1690, during the Williamite War in Ireland, Cork was a Jacobite stronghold, and while Elizabeth Fort held out for some time during the siege of Cork, artillery was brought to bear on the eastern walls of the city from a vantage point at Red Abbey. The walls were breached and the city capitulated within four days. In the decades following the siege, the fort ceased to operate as a defensive structure for the city, and in 1719 was put to use as a barracks.\nIn 1817, it was re-purposed again \u2013 this time as a prison, with many prisoners being held at the fort prior to \"penal transportation\" to New South Wales and other British colonies. It was mostly female prisoners held within the fort from 1822 onwards. The fort remained in use as a convict depot until 1837.\nIn the late 19th century, the fort reverted to military use and became a station of the Cork City Artillery. During the Irish War of Independence (1919\u20131921), Elizabeth Fort was used as a base by the \"Black and Tans\", but was relinquished by the British following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. During the succeeding Irish Civil War the fort was burned by anti-treaty forces in August 1922.The remaining interior structures of the fort date from a rebuild following this fire. Though briefly housing an air-raid shelter during \"The Emergency\" (1939\u20131945), the rebuilt interior buildings from the 1920s continued in use as a Garda (police) station until 2013. Following the closure of the Garda station buildings, the site came under the management of Cork City Council having previously been in the care of the Office of Public Works.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nAs an continually active military and police barracks for more than 400 years, Elizabeth Fort had not been open for tourism or heritage development. However, local interest groups and site stakeholders (namely the Garda\u00ed, Cork City Council and Office of Public Works) had facilitated the development of the ramparts \u2013 which were partly opened to access by tourists on a seasonal basis. Markets and festivals were also occasionally held in the fort.Since the closure of the Garda station and other offices on the site, local historical interest groups and councillors had advocated the further and permanent development of the site for tourism. In January 2014 the site was fully and formally passed to the control of Cork City Council to facilitate this development under a three-year plan.Since 2014, Elizabeth Fort has been a venue for a number of events and festivals, including the Cork Midsummer Festival, Cork Heritage Open Day, Heritage Week, Culture Night, Cork Photo 2015 and 2016, the Cork Saint Patrick's Festival and the 2015 Fin Barre's Festival.\nWhile plans were prepared for additional development (including an \"interpretive centre\"), as of late 2016, funding had not been allocated for these works. In 2018 the Irish Landmark Trust re-developed and re-purposed two of the interior buildings for use as short-let tourist accommodation.The walls and certain interior spaces of the fort are open to the public six days a week; Tuesday to Saturday 10:00 to 17:00 and Sunday 12:00 to 17:00, with free admission.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Cork\nCharles Fort (Ireland)\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Spending a day in Cork, I feel if you're heading towards the Cathedral anyway, you might as well as stop here too... and it's free! We didn't take the tour, just went through by ourselves and read all the information plaques. The place still appeared to have some improvements",

          "Passed by fleetingly with kids on a Saturday afternoon. Not a lot to see but kids enjoyed it none the less, Do not envisage a need to revisit though. Maybe a bigger story could be told. Charle's fort was a much bigger hit with the kids (and adults)",

          "If you are visiting St Fin Barre Cathedral then I will suggest you visit this Fort which is only 2 mins walk. It has free entrance. You can walk along the Fort and see the whole Cork city from the Top. And it is a breathtaking view. The history of the Fort is told while you walk",
          "We'd visited several forts as we'd traveled Ireland and as we walked Cork we'd both agreed we were \"forted out.\" And then we spotted the entrance to Elizabeth Fort and said, \"Oh look! A fort!\" and we wandered in. It's a short visit and provides an opportunity to imagine what",

          "Admission to the fort is free, but for only 3 euro you can take this awesome guided tour. The tour guide Sean C. was super knowledgeable, entertaining, and more than happy to take questions. The tour covers not just the history of the fort, but the history of Cork from",

          "The fort, unlike to nearby cathedral, is free to enter which was a pleasant surprise as unlike a working church where you might want to enter just to pray, you are only coming here to see an old monument so would expect to pay to enter. In truth, there is not a lot to see, but",
          "An interesting piece of history, just a short walk from the amazing St Fin Barre's Cathedral, Elizabeth Fort is well worth a visit. There are placards situated around the fortifications telling you about the history of the site, as well as a WW2 air raid shelter, and some stocks",

          "Located right in Cork, this is a nice walk. The Fort is has some interesting history and you can read about it when you enter (no fee). As you walk along the outer wall of the fort you get fantastic views and lots of photo ops of Cork.",
          "The Fort is located in walking distance from the city centre. It's a historical site with an interesting story to tell. Since the tours are closed for the moment you can walk the fort by your self. Nice view, even on a stormy day. I recommend it.",

          "We (myself and two boys aged 9 and 4) visited on a drizzly day - and it was still fab. It was short enough to hold their attention but big enough for them to use their imagination and pretend to be soldiers, do a bit of beheading etc. I think audio tours are available but we",

          "Elizabeth Fort is well worth a visit. I love forts and fortifications and this is a gem right in the middle of the Cork city. If you are in the area walk up the street to St Finbarrs and then round the corner to Tom Barry's pub on Barrack St for some refreshment!",

      "name": "Shandon Bells & Tower St Anne's Church",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Church of St Anne is a Church of Ireland church located in the Shandon district of Cork city in Ireland. Built between 1722 and 1726, it is situated on a hill overlooking the River Lee. The church tower is a noted landmark and symbol of the city, and the church bells were popularised in a 19th century song.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name Shandon comes from the Irish, Sean D\u00fan, meaning \"old fort\". A medieval church dedicated to St. Mary existed close to the site of this fort, and is mentioned in the decretals of Pope Innocent III in 1199 as \"St. Mary on the Mountain\". This church stood until the Williamite wars when it was destroyed during the siege of Cork (1690). In 1693 this was replaced by a church, also dedicated to St. Mary, and was located at the bottom of Mallow Lane, modern day Shandon Street. Due to population growth, it was decided to build anew on this ancient site and so in 1722 the present Church of St. Anne, Shandon was constructed.\nThe church of St. Anne attained full parochial status in 1772, when Rev. Arthur Hyde (great-great-grandfather of Dr. Douglas Hyde) was appointed its first Rector.\nAs it was built with two types of stone (red sandstone from the original Shandon castle which stood nearby, and limestone taken from the derelict Franciscan Abbey which stood on the North Mall), some sources draw a connection between the red and white materials and the colours used to represent the city. The distinct colours are recorded in a rhyme collected by 19th century antiquary Thomas Crofton Croker, which he attributes to 18th century Catholic priest and writer Father Arthur O'Leary:\n\nParty-coloured, like the people,\nRed and white stands Shandon Steeple\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Bells ===\nThe church is noted for its 8 bells, immortalised in the song \"The Bells of Shandon\" by Francis Sylvester Mahony. The largest weighs a little over 1.5 tons and was originally cast by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. To reduce vibration, they were placed in a fixed position. They first rang on December 7, 1752. They have been recast twice: in 1865 and 1906. Today, visitors can climb to the first floor and ring the bells themselves, via an Ellacombe apparatus.\nThe original inscriptions are retained on each bell:\n\nWhen us you ring we'll sweetly sing\nGod preserve the Church and King\nHealth and prosperity to all our benefactors\nPeace and good neighbourhood\nProsperity to the city and trade thereof\nWe were all cast at Gloucester in England by Abel Rudhall 1750\nSince generosity has opened our mouths our tongues shall sing aloud its praise\nI to the Church the living call and to the grave do summon all\n\n\n=== Tower ===\nThe walls of the building are 2 m (7 ft) thick and the height to the tower is 36.5 m (120 ft). This is extended a further 15 m (50 ft) for the \"pepper pot\" adornment on the tower. The McOsterich family were involved with the design and erection of this tower and to this day a special privilege is afforded them. Whenever a member of the family marries, anywhere in the world, the bells ring out in their honour. On top of this pepper pot is a weather vane in the form of a salmon, representing the fishing of the River Lee. It is an appropriate sign to have on top of a church, as in the earliest Christian days a fish was used as a symbol for the name of the Lord.\nThe fish placed above the tower is mentioned in Cork band Five Go Down to the Sea?'s song \"There's a fish on top of Shandon (swears he's Elvis)\".\n\n\n=== Clock ===\nThe clock of the tower is known to Corkonians as \"The Four Faced Liar\" because, depending on the angle of the viewer, and the effects of wind on the hands on a given face, the time may not appear to correspond perfectly on each face. Due to maintenance issues, the clock was stopped in 2013, but plans to fund repair were agreed in May 2014, and the clock restarted in September 2014.\n\n\n=== Font ===\nThe christening font, dated 1629, is a relic from the church destroyed in the siege of Cork in 1690 and bears the inscription, \"Walter Elinton and William Ring made this pant at their charges\". Within is a pewter bowl dated 1773.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChurch of Ireland Parish of St. Anne-Shandon\nShandon Bells and Tower, St. Anne's Church\nBells of Shandon being sung \u00e1 capella in the Church of St. Anne of Shandon",

        "wiki": "The Red Abbey in Cork, Ireland was a 14th-century Augustinian abbey which took its name from the reddish sandstone used in construction. Today all that remains of the structure is the central bell tower of the abbey church, which is one of the last remaining visible structures dating to the medieval walled town of Cork.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn late 13th or early 14th century, an Augustinian monastery was built in Cork, and was occupied by the friars until at least the rebellion of 1641, and possibly as late as 1700.The abbey tower was used by John Churchill (later the Duke of Marlborough) as a vantage point and battery during the Siege of Cork in 1690. The siege sought to suppress an uprising in the city and its association with the expelled Catholic King of England, James II.\nIn the eighteenth century, the Augustinian friars established a new friary in Fishamble Lane, and the Red Abbey was turned over to use as a sugar refinery. However, a fire in the refinery destroyed much of the abbey's structure in 1799.\nAll that remains today of the structure is the bell tower of the abbey's church. The tower is designated as a national monument and maintained by Cork City Council.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Cork)\n\n\n== References ==",

Shandon was the largest Shambles (open-air butcheries) in Ireland, and the Exchange was located within this commercial area.

The museum has displays covering the international Butter Exchange in the 19th century, the domestic production of butter, and the operations of Kerrygold in more recent times. The displays document elements of Irish commercial, social and domestic history. The exhibitions are intended to bring the visitor through various elements of butter production, from dairy cattle farming, to the documents and artifacts relating to the commercial butter trade.

          "This was a very informative museum. We enjoyed it because of the information that it shared about how the evolution of Irish butter has come about. There are videos and displays available to view although I would assume that since it isn\u2019t free it might be a bit more in the way",
          "Irish butter is the Grand Prix of butter and world famous. It's worth a quick visit if you have a few minutes to spend, but don't expect to be walking around the exhibit for hours it's simply not that big.",
          "If you are interested in the history of the region, it is well worth the visit. Staff very friendly and exhibits are interesting.",
          "Very informative. Lots to learn. Makes you realize how much you can take some things, such as butter, for granted. Samples would add even more to the visit.",
          "Charming little place that documents the history of butter, particularly how it rose to national prominence and an international brand. Fun little place chock full of crockery, photos of green fields, cows and a film of Irishmen building a brand. Is it for everyone? Maybe not",
          "This is a quaint and lovely little museum in the historic quarter of Cork. An overseas visitor will learn here about the development of the butter industry in Ireland. A very informative video is provided which sets the context. There is a good selection of paraphernalia",
          "Fascinating small museum outlining key points of the history of butter, from homestead to wholesale, in Ireland.",
          "this was a very good and informative museum. starting with a short video and then the museum self tour. amazing to see how this industry from such A small country can have such an influence world wide. congrats",
          "This is a very small museum, which means it doesn't take long and probably shouldn't be missed. My family almost exclusively uses Kerrygold butter and I thought a trip to Ireland wouldn't be complete without learning something about the butter process. While I was hoping to get",
          "We walked from our central Cork hotel to this quaint museum and really enjoyed learning about the history of Irish butter. The man who checked us in at the front seemed a bit grumpy but he may have been having a bad day or perhaps hadn\u2019t had any butter yet! The museum itself is",
          "Considering the massive economic impact that butter has in Ireland, this is a very small museum. However, it tells the story of the origins, growth and regulastion of butter production and its world wide sales.",
          "We found the history of Irish butter really interesting and enjoyed the exhibits, particularly the map showing the international destinations that Irish butter was exported to: Brazil, the United States, India etc Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "A one-of-a-kind museum, small but cheap (\u20ac4), highlighting a surprising cornerstone in Irish history and its economy. There's exhibits about bog butter from centuries ago, to traditional butter-making methods and churns, to butter's role in keeping Ireland economically afloat in",
          "This was right by my hostel and so worth the visit. Interesting history, and look at the industry in Ireland. It's a quaint little space.",
          "Very interesting little museum on butter. Recounts the history and importance of the butter industry in Ireland. Start with an interesting film about butter that sets the tone for the balance of your visit that can take about an hour max.",
          "Spent a couple hours reading about the history of butter making in Ireland. There is more to it than one would expect. It is better than most butters. Then of course they make butter with the help of the audience and you get to taste test it. It was interesting and worth the",
          "My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this museum in our first day in Cork on a short break. We had no idea what to expect and were pleasantly surprised by the content and quality of the museum. The museum starts with a 10 minute long video about the history of Irish butter before",
          "Without a doubt, the Butter Museum is worth the visit. We were able to catch the 12:00 butter making demonstration. The museum is small but very interesting. You need to go upstairs to see the 1000 year old box butter. The history of Irish butter is rich and full.",
          "Great place to spend time in Cork. Very interesting insight on the rise of the Irish dairy industry. Recommended to all in the area. Very insightful and inspiring.",
          "Is particularly interesting to see the area around the museum which all used to be the butter capital of ireland. There are small houses and huge buildings that were involved in various activities related to the butter industry. Chatty ticket person. Good 15 minute video",
          "Against all expectations, this was a very pleasant visit. Part of that was because we were with friends who had a \u201cbutter story\u201d but that is for another day. The gentleman manning the desk was very personable and took an interest in our story and sought out some \u201cI love the",
          "There is a very interesting video explaining the expansion of butter making in Ireland. There are also a lot of historical artefacts relating to buttermaking before it was made in a factory.",
          "OK, if the name of the museum doesn't spark keen interest in you as it did in me, then chances are you won't be enthralled with your visit. Nonetheless, it's a rather small museum that does a good job of telling the history of dairy in Ireland, as well as the very important",
          "Interesting, if you want to do something a little different. Not a huge museum, but still worth visiting. Can't comment on the demonstration as we didn't get there in time.",
          "The museum it is small, but you have the information about the importance of this product in the history of Ireland. Also, some days, you can go to see how the but\u00adter is made in a manuel way. It was curious to saw.",
          "Who would have known how interesting a walk around the artefacts in this small museum could be and the informative video worth a look if you have the time",
          "The museums shows various butter making processes and a history of the importance of the butter(market) for the economy of Ireland",
          "I had always known that there was a thriving butter market in Cork back in days gone by. I did not know there was a museum dedicated to butter on the site of the old butter market until my brother told me. We visited the museum last Thursday. There is a short audio visual at the",
          "We were somewhat underwhelmed by the museum but nonetheless enjoyed watching the very dated 20 minute film on offer. Learnt a few facts e.g. that Kerrygold is the brand name for Irish dairy cooperatives.",
          "This museum does not sound very interesting but it is well worth a visit. Lots of facts about Irish butter that we did not know about. There were informative videos and activities for children. Lots of old butter making equipment from farms as well as labels and old photographs",
          "I had seen and heard about this place and was really interested in visiting, most people thought I was mad but its a great place to visit. The staff are friendly and really knowledgeable and chatty. The entry fee is really reasonable also. I visited on Saturday so that I could",
          "We visited the museum while on the Cork city tour. The butter making demonstration was just about to begin. The man was brilliant and had us all involved at some point in the making of the butter. We even got brown bread and butter. The rest of the museum just showed the",
          "This was a hidden gem and interactive museum. Not only do you get to learn how to make butter with hands on churnning, you learn some interesting facts about an important Irish export and country folk-lore... It is an inexpensive and fun family activity.",
          "It is surprising the role that butter has played in Ireland. Very few people probably realize it. Of course those who have visited The Butter Museum are certainly aware. That said, the museum did its job. I now have Irish Butter on my table back in California. It would be",
          "This was fine. Cute even. I don't think I would recommend it as a must see in Cork, but we enjoyed our short visit here just fine. Go on a day when they are actually churning butter.",
          "Very Expensive for nothing! Its exceptionally boring with almost all reading and few actual exhibits or interactive exhibits! Would not recommend!",
          "I feel bad giving it a bad review but after paying 5.50 each there wasnt much to see or do inside., They had plenty of old and historic butter churns, but that was about it. The video describing the \"butter wars\" of the 1960's was dated and..to be honest as an American,",
          "We had some extra time and happened upon the museum. We like butter. Irish butter is an important commodity of the region, and has a fascinating history. The historical photos and short movie were really interesting. A fun afternoon, highly recommend.",
          "This is well worth a visit quite interesting to see all the things they used when making butter.Its in a pretty part of the town but feel they dont make the best of it.",
          "This is a cute \"different\" museum with the exhibits one might expect and an interesting film for all ages, depicting the evolving of the dairy industry in Ireland from cottage industry to an world wide dairy super power. Interesting explanations of the methods of quality control",
          "Very quirky little tour detailing the dairy industry in Ireland. Very fun!! Makes me wanna go home to USA and stock up on Kerrygold butter!",
          "We managed to make it there on a day that they were having a butter making demonstration, and we loved it! I was very wary, given the previous reviews, but the man leading the demonstration was extremely knowledgable and we actually ended up learning a ton. Not too much to the",
          "Not what I was expecting but good enough for the price. Only \u20ac4 and it had old churns and even some bog butter! My friend and I went here and it was a pleasant enough way to spend an hour out of the increasingly warm sun",
          "From the advertising, we expected a lot more than was on display. The exhibits were simple and very dusty. They was no live exhibit on making butter. If they had this type of hands on or live exhibit it would significantly help the museum.",
          "Fun museum for anyone who appreciates the importance of butter! It's actually a neat little museum which is easily done in under an hour. The movie at the start is nicely done. Nice place to visit .",
          "Get your expectations in check. It is a museum about butter, people, not the Louve. However for what it\u2019s was, I walked out of there mildly amused ( there is an accidentally hilarious video involving a woman, two men, and a butter churn) and more informed about butter. Kerrygold",
          "Underwhelming, I\u2019m afraid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. The \u2018Cork City Heritage Guide\u2019 says there are \u201cregular butter making demonstrations\u201d but this week there is just one demonstration - at 12 noon, Saturday. The video documentary \u2018Green to Gold. Ireland\u2019s Butter\u2019 is",
          "A rather disappointing museum. There was a good video about the production of butter. however the rest of this small museum was not particularly well set out. More artefacts of the industry would have helped. Also there was no gift area which could have have given the public the",
          "Let me preface this review by saying that my rating is based on the fact that I was able to view the butter-making demonstration. We viewed the demonstration at 12 o'clock noon. The gentleman that gave the demonstration was good natured the gentleman that gave the",
          "We were here in april 2018, and it was a small exposition about the making of butter. As we are an older couple (from the 50's) was it very interesting to see that the fabric was from 1950 also. There was a nice movie about that time.",
          "The story is rather amazing. Butter started thousands of years ago as a crude process. Over time, Ireland developed many thousands of small dairy farms which produced a product that came into growing demand around the world. To capture that market, Cork established a Butter",
          "This museum is just a few steps away from Shandon bells. When you get there you're welcomed by this very friendly gentleman who is charming and fun. The 12 minutes video tells us all about the fascinating history of Irish dairy industry and Kerry gold butter. After that you can",
          "Suffers from the same poor signposting as many Cork attractions!!! Once we eventually found it well worth a trip. Who knew that the history of Irish butter making could be so interesting. Very informative. Really enjoyed.",
          "came here on the recommendation of a local friend, and we were delighted. we had no idea that there was such a fascinating history of butter and its export and that cork is at the heart of it all fun documentary, helpful staff and fun hands-on exhibits! we will recommend for",
          "It wasn't easy to find this place, but it was well worth the hunt. The tour starts with a short film about the history of the dairy industry in Ireland. The downstairs gallery contains churns and butter memorabilia as well as signs explaining superstitions and customs. Upstairs,",
          "well worth a visit guided tours you can watch the story of the buttera in film very interesting will really enjoy it",
          "I can't really rate it, because the Butter Museum is closed during the week from Nov - April. We found this very disappointing. THe museum is steps away from the bell tower of St Anne's so it is very convenient to stop in while you are there (if it is a winter weekend).",
          "The highlight of my visit was the live session on butter making, courtesy of Dan, the butter maker ( hope I got his name right).He engaged the visitors in the process which was really fun. He also lets you taste the butter and take some with you if you want .You must check the",
          "thats a good place for you if you're interested in butter history. we were done within half an hour. it's a must see but you won;t be satisfied",
          "The video is quite old and focuses on the industry and business of butter. Lots of relics to look at but nothing much about production or making of butter. Museum could use some modern technology.",
          "We didn't know what to expect, but were intrigued - and who doesn't like butter? It was quite interesting, especially the video at the start of the museum - gave lots of historical background re dairy farming in Ireland. It's not big, but a great way to while away a bit of time",
          "Small specialty museum with artifacts (photos, churns, etc) of butter making, printed explanations of the history of butter in Cork and its role in the world butter scene. A 15 min into video was a grand intro. A few postcards were for sale, but i would have liked to buy an",
          "This is a great museum well worth a visit. There are many old pieces of equipments and artefacts surrounding buttermaking including early testing kits. There is a video on entering which really helps put into perspective the importance of the dairy industry in Ireland\u2019s economic",
          "The museum was a nice presentation. It gave useful information in an interesting way. Not a place you will want to spend hours, but good for what it is. Look for the thousand year old butter.",
          "A small museum but has an interesting story to tell. It starts with a short film which I found the most interesting. It tells the story of how a small very localised industry turned into an Irish success story with an international brand. The rest of the museum has various",
          "Those who are passionate about the history of genuine and original Irish things must stop here, even in the short pass to find out how Kerrygold's butter came out and what \"history\" tumultuous to know until he was known all over the world. Let's not forget that the Germans",
          "Stepped in out of the rain to visit the Butter Museum. I recommend watching the film just as you enter the Museum. It is by far the best part and you will learn a ton. It goes through the history of the dairy industry in Ireland, industry changes, what was done to survive and",
          "It's not a long walk from the city center and we were looking forward to the experience. Given the history and popularity of Irish butter, this is a great idea but the execution is disappointing. Cork's old butter market building is a fine venue but needs some attention, e.g.",
          "I visited the Butter Miseum on 29 August. Located in the Shandon, a part of the city visitors should not miss anyway, the Museum gets people to gain first-hand insights into a vitally important part of the local history and economics. At the beiginning of the visit, you are",
          "After watching a 15 minute video and then walking through the two storey building reading all the plaques and looking at all the historical displays, I was in awh to see how a small local farm industry grew to become a multi billion dollar operation covering at least 80",
          "If you consider how important butter is in Southern Ireland, a butter museum here equates with a beer museum in Belgium or a watch museum in Switzerland. Very interesting small museum, that tells a lot about the product (from a technical and economic point of view), about the",
          "This was a great experience! Came here with my mum and boyfriend and wasn't let down! Would definitely recommend.",
          "The museum is well laid out over two floors with much information, photographs and artefacts but the most interesting part is the practical live demonstration of hand churning cream into butter, which the audience can then taste, spread on crusty bread. There is an educational",
          "If you want to learn about the Irish Gold, the video at The Butter Museum tells it all. The rest of the museum did nothing for me. It is two levels, with displays of churns, crocks, and pics. Restrooms available, no sample to try. Nice staff. One visit was enough for me,",
          "Lots of artifacts, posters and videos about the dairy industry, which was still quite primitive in Ireland on into the 1960's, when many homes still drew their water by hand from wells. I learned all about local co-ops, life on a dairy farm, coopering (barrel/tub-making), and",
          "Worth seeking out in a quiet square in Shandon but withon walking distance of the city centre. We enjoyed the (itself quite old now) film on the butter industry and its history in Ireland. Lots of exhibits and memorabalia over the two floors. All in all, a nice end to our",
          "This exhibition is very dated and cold. There isn't much information if you are just walking around. It is worth a look if you are playing tourist for a day but if you were to miss it on your trip to Cork it would not be the end of the world.",
          "Okay, who would ever think about going to a Butter Museum. We had visited the nearby Shandon Bell Tower and saw this museum. Upon entering we met a very helpful guide who started a video about the history of the Irish dairy industry. Sounds a bit mundane, but not so. We",
          "Tucked away down a little road is the Butter Museum.. totally worth going to it's SO full of information, and an insight into how the life of the people in this trade, The chap who did the 'talk' had his own style of delivery, making sure any youngsters were included in any",
          "Visited on a Saturday in mid April. A small admission fee and as luck would have it, we were there in time for the butter making demonstration by a gentlemen (name escapes me) who was such an entertainer. Passionate about teaching us the 'old way' of making butter, complete",
          "This will not be for everyone. We followed friends recommendation to see the butter museum with a group of varying ages and interests. I enjoyed learning the history of dairy in Ireland but mine was the minority view in our group. It is a small museum spread over 2 floors.",
          "I hadn't heard of the Butter Museum before I arrived in Cork, but once I found it I knew I had to visit. The museum begins with a video on the history of Irish butter and other dairy products, then features a set of artifacts on butter production, sales, and storage. The",
          "We were a bit late getting to the museum but it is worth a stop. There is a short film before you take the tour. It brought back a lot of memories of the old ways of \"life as it was\". A good place to take the younger ones and for you too, if you would like a trip down memory",
          "If you like butter and its history in Ireland then this is the place to visit. Thoroughly enjoyed the displays and demonstrations. The demonstration on the Saturday we visited was free and the gentleman who talked us through the process of butter making was very entertaining.",
          "Worth visiting. Demonstration informative. Displays on 2 floors. Easy Access. History we'll described",
          "Enjoyed it so much that I went twice. Good film about the rise of Irish butter and the EU. Assorted artefacts and interesting information on cow rustling and butter quality control.",
          "The Butter museum was OK for a short visit, interesting video and someone historical information about the butter industry",
          "Fairly long introduction in the film and did get a bit boring, but otherwise quite an interesting place to look round.",
          "It is a really good place to visit if you are interested in the story of butter. Being a small museum you can see the things that are used to make the butter. It is a small and old place but if you have to spend some days around the city the museum is a interesting place to go",
          "What fun, this musuem gives great insight into Kerry Gold butter. This is a stop on the hop on hop off bus, which is great as it is up a sterp hill. After you learn just about everything you ever wanted to know about the long history of Irish butter, you really have a hankering",
          "Small but interesting history of butter making and distribution and effects of history and economics of Ireland. Would have liked a bit on modern production",
          "The butter museum was right up the street from our hotel, so as we were walking around Cork, we found it and went in. It was quite interesting how butter industry transformed through the years.",
          "OK, why the Butter Museum? I don't know but I have a little interest in Irish agriculture and love Kerry Gold Butter. This was a blast . The museum is small and albeit small is a good representation of the industry and tradition. They have an old film to watch that explains",
          "My teenage son and I visited the butter museum on a lark, but ended up learning a good bit about butter, the history of the Cork economy, and sharing some laughs. Just finding the museum is a challenge... but brings you into a quaint, colorful Cork neighborhood which is part of",
          "Very informative museum on the history of butter making in Ireland. Uses film and exhibits. Helpful and informative staff. Have demonstrations of butter making on certain days.",
          "We found this place using Trip Advisor for things to see in Cork besides Blarney Castle and this little place came up and we had such a ball visiting. What a great history of Cork and Ireland in this little museum. You need a parking disk to park on the street and you buy them",
          "I visited as part of the Lifelong Learning Festival so admission was free. Watch out for these offers throughout the year coinciding with other festivals. Admission is cheap though if you have to pay. The 15 minute video was informative and the guide was also very knowledgeable.",
          "It has some interesting, historical pieces of the butter-making process. Especially a pot of 1000 yr old butter. The panels were interesting, witty and informative. The video shown at the start of the tour was boring & a little bit condescending (in my opinion) of Ireland's",
          "The butter in Ireland really is better, and now we know why! This cute little museum is worth a quick stop. There's a 15-minute video introducing the background of butter making and a few small exhibits. If you're in Cork city, check it out!",
          "Very reasonable pricing to enter the butter museum (\u20ac4 for an adult). Nice little walk around the museum. The place was very clean and the man at the desk was a gentleman.",
          "Honestly, there was nothing but a some butter cups and jars. A bit of history, but very boring overall.",
          "It's a small museum and it may sound an oddity, but it's well worth the visit. Really informative, and the info is incredibly well written.",
          "I enjoyed this little museum but can see how it wouldn't be for everyone. I learned about the history of the butter industry in Ireland. I was disappointed that I didn't get to see actual churning of butter. This is only done on certain days, so check ahead. It took about an",
          "A great place to go to learn all about butter! It's something a little different and if you lactose intolerant probably not your first place to go. It's very close to St.Anne's Church on Shanndon Street so you can get the two sights done.",
          "Lovely museum worthy visiting for me from a country without butter tradition. Really warmhearted manager. \u20ac3 for students \u20ac4 for adults.",
          "As a local, I really enjoyed the museum, but I don't think I would recommend it to people from other countries or from non-farming backgrounds! Their video showed the history of butter, all the way up to the early 90's, so they could certainly update it to include the last 20",
          "Certainly worth walking up the hill - if only to find out where Kerry Gold came from. Butter was BIG business for thousands of small dairy farmers who often pulled their carts with donkeys to bring their churns to the butter dairy. Luckily we were all oaps so cost not too great.",
          "It's a small quirky insightful cute local museum about Irish Butter. It's only \u20ac4 in and some of the exhibits are interesting so it's worth popping in while exploring the must see historical Shandon area of Cork.",
          "Nice quite place in the center of Cork, which is a very boring city any way. Nice guy who is telling you a history of traditional Irish butter making, some pictures and some music... The guy is preparing a butter in front of you, you can participate if you like. Quite boring and",
          "Never thought there would be a museum on 'butters'! But I loved every bit of it. Its a small museum and as we entered we were directed to a big screen showing us the history of dairy and butter industry in Cork. All the exhibits were interesting and well maintained. Being an",
          "A strange item to have a museum on we thought.....and we were late, arriving close to closing time and nearly did not go in but glad we did. We had spent the day in Cork shopping just before christmas and crossed the river Lee and walked up Widderling's lane (old town) to be",
          "I didn't know that Cork had the biggest butter exchange in the world! How impressive the museum becomes after knowing this! I like that they went through the hassle of translating a fully guide for the entire exhibit into 8 languages - thank you for that! If you check with the",
          "We popped by on a llittle walk to see what was around and the chap with the keys said they weren't open yet but he couldn't have us ladies out in the cold. We paid the \u00a34 entrance fee and settled down to watch the video. Quite interesting and informative background into how",
          "Just two floors and about 6 rooms, it does not take very long to visit this museum - a bit longer if you watch the video and read all the information. The section on the 'bog butter' was particularly interesting and also the butter labels. Fee for entry. Parking is available",
          "When we were walking around the town, we stumbled across the Butter Museum. Had read a bit about it, but not much. Remembered it was pretty cheap price-wise, and since we're ballin' on a budget, decided to give it a shot. SO GLAD WE DID!!! This was the best museum I've ever been",
          "Most certainly worth visiting. It is an extremely interesting and unusual museum. Initially shown a video presentation which lasted about 15/20 mins and focused on the history of Irelands diary industry from late 50's to mid 80's with the emphasis on the impact of the EU.",
          "Perhaps not to everyone's taste, but I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the butter museum - very interesting! The museum isn't huge but tells a great story and is well-presented.",
          "Most interesting was the video in which the transition from small farm, home production to international exporting is described. Some of the other exhibits were also interesting. If there had not been other attractions nearby, we might have missed it, but it was good exercise",
          "My husband and I visited the museum and were not sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised! There is a movie describing the impact the butter industry has had on the Irish economy in the 20th century. There are exhibits of churns and other tools used in previous",
          "We stopped here while visiting Cork for a few days as a part of a walking tour of west Ireland. The visit starts with a short--old-- video about the history of butter's role in Irish history. It was interesting and a good start to understanding why a museum would be dedicated",
          "Up one of the hills on the north side in an interesting neighbourhood. Good explanation of the history and importance of butter to Ireland. Worth the effort to get up the hill.",
          "Not the most exciting place in the world but it was very interesting to learn about the huge impact of butter in the history of Ireland.",
          "This place was close to our hotel so we thought it was worth a look. The experience starts with s 15 minute film explaining the history marketing Irish butter as Kerrygold from the 1960's. It's remarkable how an industry set in its old fashioned ways could be modernised and",
          "This a great museum that introduces Ireland's long tradition of agricultural production and export. It is a little dated (or old fashioned) in the way it presents information, but it is a fascinating story.",
          "This place provided very detail of the history of Ireland butter and the process of butter making. A great place to learn.",
          "Let's just say it's not a must do. If you are here for a really long time and need something to do, this works.",
          "\"Do not cook with Kerry Gold!\" Do you remember the old advertisement? It spread (pun intended) in many countries around the world. Worth a visit, we learnt about the bog butter!!!",

          "I have to admit we were sceptical about a butter museum but with a voucher for us and my 18 month old and mother in law it was \u20ac8 for an hrs entertainment. We watched an informative video on the history of the butter industry in Ireland which gave an insight in to social history",
          "I'm from a rural background so some of the exhibits were familiar from relatives farms. It gives a good insight into the significance butter had historically to Cork as well as the actual process of making butter down the years. There were also maps upstairs showing the",
          "Where else would there be a museum devoted to butter? The exhibits are interesting, showing how butter was made on a very small scale not so many years ago (we passed a huge factory where Kerry Gold is made now). The key attraction is the demonstration of butter making. The",
          "The butter making demonstration this morning (we went on Thursday at 12:00) was fantastic! It's great for children and adults who are somewhat interested in history and/or the dairy industry in Ireland; the man who runs it is absolutely lovely. I would go back just to see him",
          "Our trip to Cork kicked off with a visit to this little place so steeped in the cultural history of Cork. We had a hard time finding parking as we had no parking disc. The friendly gentleman at the Reception kindly allowed us to park inside the premises. The museum has a",
          "I dragged my daughter to the Cork Butter Museum (which does not open until 10 a.m.). First we saw a film about the history of the butter industry in Ireland and then were free to walk around and look at the displays. It was interesting to me, but not necessarily for the younger",
          "The tour begins with a video that documents the rise of the butter industry in Ireland. The setup is informal - basically a group of chairs in front of a television, which is located in a large room. This is where the main exhibit is. There is a second floor which is a",
          "It was a rainy morning so we decided to give it a try. We had fun. Host prepared butter from scratch. Then we tried it with soda bread. I will highly recommend this if you travel with children.",
          "And even then you might decide you shouldn't have. You start off with a video and then look at some old equipment used and read some boards. Nope, was expecting more",
          "We visited as we had complimentary tickets and it was very quaint and quite informative. It won't take long to visit and if you know anything about the history of Irish creameries etc. this will be a good place to go.",
          "There's not a lot to the Butter Museum but it was very interesting to learn about how the dairy industry in Ireland has evolved. We love the butter in Ireland and were anxious to visit this museum!",
          "My husband and I both work in the dairy industry so this was a must see for us. A quaint museum that gives a history of one of Ireland's biggest exports--BUTTER! Detailed history from the early days to modern dairy markets. Friendly the guides that are well-versed in the",
          "this place has an interesting in site in to the past of the city of Cork. Butter was their main export supplying ships sailing to the new world of America. great little museum in an interesting part of the city.",
          "Was not on our list to see. Very informative and interesting how the butter industry grew and developed in Ireland.",
          "We thought we'd step into the Butter Museum to check it out. It is quite nice and has a lot of information about Kerrygold (my favorite...yum!) - and Irish dairy history. I even picked up a very nice kitchen apron printed with an older Cork butter on it. I love it!",
          "showing of old articles used to make butter, and a somewhat glimpse in the importance of this industry in the area.... not worth it... unless you are a afficionado of butter...",
          "Really disappointed to give this a bad review, considering we chose to go because of the good TripAdvisor reviews. However the museum is boring and dull, we checked the website before which stated there would be some sort of demonstration on the day we went, however there",
          "We went with the hope of a demonstration or something a little more interactive. However whilst we did learn about the heritage of irish butter we left within an hour of visiting as we had exhausted the topic and all the information on it. It is good as a time filler between",
          "Well laid out lots of things to see its well worth it just to see the history , just down the road is another great CHURCH",
          "This little hole in the wall is the Cork Butter Museum. The old machinery and tools were neat to look at, if you are into antiques, but really not worth my time.",
          "This is the most quirky museum I have visited; I loved it. It really is dedicated to the history of butter production in Cork. Its history stretches from the times where cattle rustling was a badge of honour for chieftains, through to the haggling of the butter market found at",
          "Worth visiting while in this interesting part of the city, just across the road from St Anne's Church and the Shandon Bells. Butter is the theme but this draws on much wider information on local social, political and economic history. Allow about an hour",
          "Great spot! Nice to see a bit of Cork history. Location: Located behind the Firkin crane & Very near the Shandon bells. There is a few parking spaces around the museum and streets near by. Note: Remember to bring a parking disc. Visit: Very informative! Starts with a video on",

          "Nice little museum focused on a single, important subject -- butter! Butter making is an important Irish industry, with a long history that's worth exploring in the exhibits. TIP: Butter-making demonstrations Saturdays at 12 noon.",
          "Interesting well kept museum. Very friendly and helpful staff. A nice video on how butter became a main export. Could have used more material on how butter is made. 40 min visit.",
          "Didn't cost much to go round this museum, my dad made me go in and there was plenty to look at but it was quite boring if I'm honest. If you're interested in that kind of thing then it's worth a visit.",
          "We dropped into the Butter museum to get out of the rain. Its an incredibly interesting tale of how butter came to be the biggest export for Ireland and all the elements surrounding it. It also had a few interesting side stories related to butter - was way more entertaining than",
          "It was very interesting to see how Kerry Gold grew from a small business to a world wide operation company! There was a video which explained everything well and a lot of old artifacts from the early times of butter production. It was not expensive but a nice way to spend the",
          "A lovely evening on the city tour of cork best stop of Shandon bells,Church, and tower where we rang the bells.. a lot of steps to climb but the view at top is wonderful then visited the butter market bot great value and friendly assistants 2 visit this year 2 nice tea rooms",
          "Cork butter was a world export in the 1800s. The museum is located a block from St. Anne's where you can ring the bells and climb the tower. There are very interesting exhibits concerning the industry at this time and a short film. It's a good place to bring the family. You will",
          "The staff was very kind to us. As we entered, he played a short documentary about Kerrygold himself. We really enjoyed it! It is located right next to Shandon Bell Church so you can easily find it. Although other exhibition was not very useful but if you are interested in",
          "I know that it sounds odd to think that a butter museum is interesting but it is a worthwhile visit for an hour or two and it is locate just down the street from St. Anne's Shandon Church.",
          "I was more curious about a museum all about butter - being a foodie and reading how this area had supplied all the butter for the British Isles, India, Canada and Australia in the 1800s. The entrance fee is 4E and the museum is small, but I learned a lot about the butter",
          "I grew up on a dairy farm so going to a butter museum had me pretty excited. I brought some friends who were visiting Cork with me....They seemed to like it but I loved it. Found some old butter wrappers from my local dairy and reading about the history of butter in Cork was",
          "Fascinating short tourism experience revealing an integral part of agricultural history in an easy way.Visit it along with the nearby Shandon Bells.Suggest taking hop on/off bus , visit the Bells, have a coffee (couple of cafes nearby) and then the Butter Market.",
          "Really quite interesting. The experience sheds a new light upon the butter industry of Ireland. But it also tells us about the dairy industry as a whole.",
          "We learned a lot and were impressed that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Cork used to supply butter not only to Britain but also India and Australia. After a decline and almost collapse, Irish farmers were transformed when they entered the EU and the Kerrygold brand",
          "This came up in TripAdvisor for things to do in Cork, and we jokingly talked about going. When we were walking around later in the day, trying to figure out what to do, we found ourselves heading to the Butter Museum. A short walk from City Centre, once you go in there's a",
          "We had a shockingly good time here, despite the fact we avoid butter in our diet whenever possible. A very interesting look into Ireland's history through a less traditional story line. Highly recommended. It doe snot have to be a long stop, and you won't regret devoting the",
          "I'll be completely honest with you. I never really thought that much about butter until I visited this museum. It traces the history of butter through the centuries and gives you an incite into butter production years ago and how it was brought to Cork to be sold. It also gives",
          "Great history of butter in general, and the consolidation of a cottage industry into a co-operative commercial powerhouse. A must for any business management, or marketing student.",
          "The butter museum is nicely laid out and details lots of interesting facts and figures concerning butter production in Cork and Ireland.It brought back lots of memories when I saw the Cork and Kerry brand displayed as well as the Black Swan butter which was popular in the 1950s.",
          "What a wonderful and unexpected experience! This unassuming little museum is both charming and educational, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the growth of the Irish butter brand. A great trip!",
          "Before my wife and I visited this museum we had no idea of the importance butter had in the history of Ireland. Worth a visit if for no other reason than to watch the documentary and look at the old way of making butter. This is a stop on a bus tour. Take the bus and get off",
          "Staff were lovely and very helpful. Reasonable prices to get in and packed full of exhibits and information. I unfortunately missed the butter demonstration but I'm sure that is really cool. Saw a video at the end about Kerry gold, hadn't realised how it started from nothing and",
          "Indeed a quirky museum but not worth wasting time or money on it. There is a 15 minute film on CD, quality not good, but some interesting stats on how Kerrygold was started. Some photos and artifacts from the old days both upstairs and on main floor. Nothing about the modern",
          "#teamkerrygold Watch the video...it was actually super interesting. I was not too keen to go-but I'm glad I did. Allow 30-45 min.",
          "A nice historical review of the butter trade in Ireland. Some interesting facts and photos, Close to Shandon.",
          "Small, charity run museums with unusual subject matter should be cherished by the cities they help enrich. At the Butter Museum you get the feeling Cork has turned its back on the potential this space could provide up on the North hill next to the boarded up Butter Exchange.",
          "Nice and informative museum if you're interested in food production it's worth seeing it... The exposition is only about butter, I've read that there should be handcrafts in general but there was nothing else but butter production...",
          "So glad we decided to walk up the hill from our hoteo look through the Butter Museum well worth the time we spent in here. You just have to make sure your flash is switched off your camera before you go in. Set aside time because there is a lot to see and read. Well worth the",
          "Whoda thunk I would ever visit a butter Museum but I have to admit this was well worth it. I had no idea how important butter was and still is to the Irish economy and what effect it's transition has been on it's society. Butter rivals beer as the major food export. I had no",
          "What trip to Ireland would be complete without butter?! Had a great couple of hours here! The gentleman working on the admissions desk was absolutely lovely and very welcoming. The museum itself is quite small however provided great insight. Our favourite artefact was the",

          "It's kind of like an elaborate school project by a butter obsessed eccentric but lovable student. Uninspired building layout that could have easily been an office space, but as a friend lovingly put it, the museum is a \"tour de force of mediocrity\" which with the right sense of",
          "Good afternoon filler, not a full day activity though. Easy walking access from Cork centre or we saw a tour bus go up. Great demonstration, can even taste butter made there and then!",
          "Nice displays. The demonstration was super because the presenter shared a lot of local history along with the butter making. Highly recommended!",
          "very educational experience, I had no idea how important butter had been to the rural economy, not did I realise that barrels of butter were exported from Cork all over the world, even as far as Melbourne, Australia if the map in the museum is to be believed.",
          "I think this is worth a visit, even though the exhibits are a bit shoddy and the information sporadic. If you love butter and want to know why Cork was central to its history, then you have to pay a visit. Plan on a half an hour or so.",
          "You can learn all about the butter industry in Ireland through an interesting video. The exhibits were ok, nothing outstanding. Wish they gave us a sample of the butter, on some bread!",

          "You expect more from a museum. The video is interesting sure, but i can find it somewhere else I guess. I don\u00b4t think is worth to pay 4 euros. You better spend that money on beer and read about butter in Wikipedia. Btw it\u00b4s cold inside",
          "The museum has real potential but is sadly dated. It would benefit greatly from some interactive features particularly for kids: butter churning/making/stamping for example. The introductory video was filmed in the 90s and could do with being updated. The gift shop needs",
          "But very interesting place to realise what was the most important product in Ireland that Ireland had the largest butter market in the world. The tickets are cheap which is sometimes very important.",
          "We were not sure what to expect at the Butter Museum, but we found it to be very interesting. We learned so much about the butter industry in Ireland, it was much more interesting than we anticipated!",
          "The museum is small and quaint with a short video you can watch first. There is a lot of information on the process of making butter and why butter is important to Ireland. The price is cheap enough that it is fine to do if you have the time, but if you have much to see and",
          "It is a simple museum. Very easy to see. You enter the museum and see a video/documentary about the origin and the commercial evolution of the butter. It is very cheap to visit, so no impact in your budget. And if you have the guide given in the tourism office you have a",
          "Good film shows how the dairy farmers combined to form the Kerrygold name - dated video but great for those who remember the adverts etc. Lots of milk churns, butter packets and a few photos. Worth a brief trip just for the novelty",

          "A very enjoyable and informative visit. The museum might be slightly shabby but if anything this adds to its endearing quirkiness, as does the introductory video on VHS (how very nostalgic). The museum is small but is packed full of interesting history - many other museums",
          "A beautiful building but needs an investment in its exhibition. Great potential bit completely underutilised. So much history there for Cork and the whole region supplying the butter but it doesn't get it across.",
          "For history buffs like me, learning about Cork's world famous butter market will be a must-do on your trip here. Though the museum is small, it has a good amount of information. Some themes include: transformation of butter distribution from individual dairy farms to corporate",
          "I found it interesting being from a farming background but I think it could be a bot more interactive and there could be more added to the displays and the history. It was worth the admission but I think more could be added to the museum to make it a more immersive experience",
          "I was very impressed with the Butter Museum. It was near our hotel and the man at the entrance was so nice to us one day that we thought we should at least see the museum. The movie had a really good history of the famine and how the butter trade helped turn around the",

          "Ever since I can remember, I have always been obsessed with butter. So imagine my surprise when, at a loose end in Cork, I discovered that they have an entire museum devoted to the stuff. Well, actually, I just went, as I am sure some do, simply out of a sense of curiosity and a",
          "Me and my companions LOVE butter and made a special effort to visit this museum. It only takes about an hour unless you stop to read all the information provided. It starts with a video presentation of the history and importance of butter to Irish economy. Quite interesting.",
          "Very very interesting, it explains every passage of the making (also with a little video). We were happy to see how irish people care about their tradition, so go there and see it, 3\u20ac for students!",
          "I paid E4 for myself and my son got in free so the price was decent enough. There is a video at the beginning which I found interesting, but my son got bored of after the first 5 minutes. There are a number of artifacts and this is interesting for older visitors but I'm not",
          "Without watching the video setting the scene and explaining about the Kerry Gold franchise being formed , it would have been a bit boring and dull. Actually for the double ticket of entry here and St Anne's of Sheldon. it was 6 euros well spent",
          "Very friendly personnel. But the museum starts with a movie, which is hard to follow and not that entertaining and the rest of the museum shows some artifacts and easing signs, but they could have made it much more inter active. The exhibition in the second floor: what's the",
          "We wouldn't have gone out of our way to visit the Butter Museum but since it is only 100 metres from the Shandon Bells and in a very old neighborhood of the city full of narrow, winding lanes, we decided it would be a pity not to visit. A small but highly informative museum with",
          "It was very cute. We loved the old adverts from the 50's and 60's. The video seemed boring to begin with, but stick with it, the characters are lovely.",
          "It could be very interesting historical place. You can find lots of information about the Irish butter, but the place is a bit boring.",
          "Decided to visit this museum. It is \u20ac4 to visit and I thought it was worth it. There was a number of visitors while I was visiting. The tour started with a video with the history of Kerrygold butter in 1960s and 1970s. The downstairs exhibit shows the history of butter and that",
          "I wouldn't say the Butter Museum is worth making a special trip for, but it's certainly interesting enough to stop in if you're nearby (very close to the Shandon Bells, for those who may wish to combine a visit to that attraction)! As for the museum itself, it's an excellent",
          "This is one place in Cork where you can avoid the mist for an hour or two depending on your level of interest. It has many exhibits and videos and films that tell a fascinating story of Irelands butter industry that carries on today. Interesting.",

          "Interesting time to spend a few hours on a rainy day in Cork ... the butter trade in Ireland was a major export as it led the world in butter manufacturing. The museum has an informative video for you to view on arriving , then you can walk through the small building at a",
          "Not knowing much about the museum, we decided to go check it out, mostly for the novelty of it, but also being in walking distance of our hotel. The introductory film was chock full of good information and statistics that really shows how this industry so deeply impacted",
          "We were met at a charming man, who told us about this small museum. It is a nice place to visit, and a \"must see\" in Cork.",
          "Got free entry as we were the first visitors of the season. Interesting film and exhibition giving an insight into Irish farmer's lives and how the production of butter has affected the Irish economy.",

          "I think that this museum is very nice because it shares several point of views about the butter and its industry. You can see how the butter is made, the history of the most famous Irish butter and the importance it had for the development of the farmers' way of life. I found",
          "You start your tour with a very interesting film about the history of Irish butter and the Irish Butter Board, KerryGold. Then you go into a room and look at labeled artifacts, which are also interesting. If you choose you can go upstairs and see more about Irish history and",
          "Well, you do learn that the Irish like their butter, and how the KerryGold brand came about, but you also get an idea of how important butter and dairy products were to the Irish economy, as well as glimpses of agrarian life in the early part of the 20th century (not that long",
          "So do you know how the name KerryGold butter came into existence? Take a short inexpensive trip to the Butter Museum while in Cork. If you are driving, the place is really up that little hill on the curve to the tiny car park. We enjoyed learning about the butter roads which I",
          "Sorry this is from June 2011 but we recommended this to some friends who went recently and loved it! It is so wonderful to see the history and artifacts that saved Ireland when many were starving and struggling to survive. The docent was a kind, sincere elderly man who",
          "Lovely little gem of a museum in the old part of the city, a few metres from St Anne's and the Shandon bells. During the last twenty years we Irish threw out so much of our history and heritage for a modren almost plastic life. It was so refreshing to stroll around the exhibits",
          "We arrived as they were closing, but he was nice enough to let us go through. The video is interesting, but upstairs is the most interesting as it goes through the history of how butter really changed the economy of Ireland. It built the roads. On our way out the man at the desk",
          "A tiny museum that costs \u20ac4 to get in. The dvd they play is interesting enough but not much else in there is. The museum is not much bigger than a house. In my home city we have a massive 5 story museum that's free so I can't really recommend paying \u20ac4 to get in to this place.",
          "This a small but interesting museum, that deals with the history of butter making in south west Ireland. It is worth a detour of no more than a hour as it only has a couple of rooms of exhibits.",

          "Cost 4 euro and to be honest was disappointing. Feel that so much more could have been made of this. Video was Ok. Slightly lengthy but gave the history of Kerrygold. Exhibits were limited and place just lacked enthusiasm. Could have done so much more.",
          "At first, I hesitated about whether I should see this museum or not. It seemed to be no more than a commonplace museum according to the name. I finally decided to go there and see what it was, and I was happily surprised : butter in Cork is full of history! It is worth seeing...",
          "On a wet rainy day popped in here. How can there be a museum to butter? Well it was quite interesting and small with alot of old photographs and a bit of history on butter-making in Cork. Came out thinking it was a bit bizarre, glad I went but would not go again.",

          "Our family visited the butter museum in August and found it to be much more interesting and informative than expected. We just expected a quirky museum but it was much more. Butter was very important to development in Cork and Ireland in general and we found what we learned",
          "We took the walk through Shandon and stopped in at the Butter Museum. My 70 year old father wasn't so sure about the visit, but we all enjoyed it - my parents, me, and my three year old! There was lots to see, and we learned so much about the butter industry in Ireland. Thank",

        "wiki": "Blarney Castle (Irish: Caisle\u00e1n na Blarnan) is a medieval stronghold in Blarney, near Cork, Ireland. Though earlier fortifications were built on the same spot, the current keep was built by the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, a cadet branch of the Kings of Desmond, and dates from 1446. The Blarney Stone is among the machicolations of the castle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle originally dates from before 1200, when a timber house was believed to have been built on the site, although no evidence remains of this. Around 1210 this was replaced by a stone fortification. It was destroyed in 1446 but subsequently rebuilt by Cormac L\u00e1idir MacCarthy, Lord of Muscry, who also built castles at Kilcrea and Carrignamuck.The castle was besieged during the Irish Confederate Wars and was seized in 1646 by Parliamentarian forces under Lord Broghill. However, after the Restoration, the castle was restored to Donough MacCarty, who was made 1st Earl of Clancarty.During the Williamite War in Ireland in the 1690s, the 4th Earl of Clancarty (also named Donough MacCarty) was captured, and his lands (including Blarney Castle) were confiscated by the Williamites.\nThe castle was sold and changed hands several times \u2014 Sir Richard Pyne, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, owned it briefly \u2014 before being purchased in the early 16th century by Sir James St John Jefferyes, governor of Cork City.Members of the Jefferyes family built a mansion near the keep. This house was destroyed by fire, and in 1874 a replacement Scottish baronial-style mansion, known as Blarney House, was built overlooking the nearby lake. In the mid 19th century, the Jefferyes and Colthurst families were joined by marriage, and the Colthurst family still occupies the demesne. In May 2008, the present estate owner, Sir Charles St John Colthurst, Baronet, succeeded in a court action to eject a man who had lived on his land for 44 years. The man's great-grandfather had been the first to occupy the estate cottage.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe castle is now a partial ruin with some accessible rooms and battlements. At the top of the castle lies the Stone of Eloquence, better known as the Blarney Stone. Tourists visiting Blarney Castle may hang upside-down over a sheer drop to kiss the stone, which is said to give the gift of eloquence. There are many versions of the origin of the stone, including a claim that it was the Lia F\u00e1il \u2014 a numinous stone upon which Irish kings were crowned.\nSurrounding the castle are extensive gardens. There are paths touring the grounds with signs pointing out the various attractions such as several natural rock formations with fanciful names such as Druid's Circle, Witch's Cave and the Wishing Steps. The grounds include a poison garden with numerous poisonous plants, including wolfsbane, mandrake, ricin and opium, as well as cannabis. Blarney House is also open to the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Blarney Castle Website",

        "wiki": "Ballintemple (Irish: Baile an Teampaill, meaning \"the town of the church\") is a suburb of Cork city, Ireland. The village is situated on the east side of the city with its limits extending to the River Lee and the village of Blackrock further to the east. Originally, Ballintemple was a separate village but today it has been enclosed by the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTemple Hill, Churchyard Lane, and Ballintemple itself derive their names from an ecclesiastical and burial site at the top of Temple Hill. While some historical texts suggest that this graveyard was sited at an early medieval church of the Knights Templar, this is not supported by other texts, and modern historians assert that this association is incorrect. Whatever the case, while the graveyard remains, no archaeological evidence of an adjoining church has been subject to modern survey. The graveyard itself has been subject to survey, and while it may have been used in the early medieval period, the earliest recorded burial event was that of the entrails of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton who was killed in the 1690 Siege of Cork and whose intestines were removed and buried here to preserve the body prior to transport back to England. The earliest remaining extant burial markers (with discernable dates) are dated to the early 18th Century. The antiquary and folklorist Thomas Crofton Croker surveyed the graveyard in the early 19th century. Croker records a folksong relating to the graveyard as well as documenting a marker for an 18th-century burial of a Lieutenant Henry Richard Temple who died with his young wife during a journey from the Caribbean (via Ireland) to England. During one such survey in the early 1800s, Croker was chased by locals who mistook his survey for grave robbery. The graveyard is accessible but closed to new burials (save to a few families with existing burial rights).\nOther memorial markers in Ballintemple include the McCarthy Monument (constructed in the 19th Century at Diamond Hill to honour ex-MP Alexander McCarthy), and a plaque at the junction of Ardfoyle and Blackrock road (commemorating the 1798 hanging in Ballintemple of an accused United Irishman).The ruins of Dundanion Castle lie close to P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh by the River Lee. William Penn, the founder of the state of Pennsylvania, is said to have departed from here on his journey to the United States in 1682. Some time earlier, Sir Walter Raleigh is reported to have spent some time here before setting off on his final voyage to the West Indies in August 1617.George Boole, the mathematician and inventor of Boolean algebra, lived in Ballintemple during the nineteenth century whilst professor at University College Cork. He died in December 1864, after catching pneumonia as the result of a rain storm whilst walking the four miles between his house and the university to give a lecture.The old, abandoned Beaumont Quarry lies adjacent to P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Rinn and Temple Hill. In its time, it provided limestone blocks for some of the notable buildings of Cork City. Prior to the expansion of Cork's suburbs in the 20th century, Ballintemple (as with nearby Ballinlough and Flower Lodge) was also home to a number of market gardens and nurseries - such as that of William Baylor Hartland.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nThe Blackrock Road runs through the heart of the village which has a post office, some small shops, and two public houses \u2013 The Venue and The Temple Inn (known locally as Longboats). The Lavanagh Centre is also located in the village, and offers services to the physically handicapped - including physical therapy in its swimming pool.\n\n\n== Stadia and events ==\n\nP\u00e1irc U\u00ed Rinn and P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, both owned by the Gaelic Athletic Association, are based in the area. These are used by various Cork GAA teams and clubs for hurling and Gaelic football matches, and contribute to congestion in the area on match-days and when used for special events. Also close-by to Temple Hill are the grounds of Cork Constitution Football Club.On the eastern side of P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh is the Atlantic Pond, which was built as part of the scheme to drain the marshy area next to the River Lee and which is now used by walkers and runners. The showgrounds of the Munster Agricultural Society also adjoin P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh and prior to 2012 were used for occasional agricultural exhibitions. Cork City Council proposed a broad redevelopment of the showgrounds, P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh and Atlantic Pond areas, under a master plan for the \"Marina Park\" area. The proposed development included considerable changes to P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, which were completed during 2017, with additional works to follow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBallintemple is served by a single city bus route, number 202, which runs from Mahon, through Blackrock, Ballintemple, Cork City Centre, to Gurranabraher and Knocknaheeny.\nThe nearest currently active railway station is Kent Station Cork. However, from 1850 to 1932, the line of the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway ran just north of the village centre. From 1880 to 1932, there was a station along this stretch of line called the Show Ground Halt railway station, and this served Ballintemple.The area was also previously served by trams.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nGeorge Boole, mathematician and logician\nMary Elmes, humanitarian activist\nWilliam Baylor Hartland, horticulturist\nMaurice Healy, politician, lawyer and Member of Parliament\nCillian Murphy, film and stage actor\nEthel Voynich, author\nSimon Zebo, professional rugby player\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Daly's Bridge is a pedestrian bridge spanning the River Lee in Cork, Ireland.\nKnown locally as the Shakey Bridge, it joins Sunday's Well on the north side, to Fitzgerald's Park in the Mardyke area on the south.Completed in 1926 and opened in 1927, it is the only suspension bridge in Cork City. It was constructed by the London-based David Rowell & Company to the design of Stephen W. Farrington, the Cork City Engineer.\nConstructed primarily of wrought iron, the bridge spans 160 feet, and the timber planked walkway is four and a half feet wide.The bridge takes its official name from Cork businessman James Daly, who contributed to the cost of the bridge. Its colloquial name (the \"Shakey Bridge\" or \"Shaky Bridge\") derives from the movement of the platform when running or jumping on the bridge.In August 2019, work began on restoration of the bridge. It was dismantled into four sections and removed so that repair of the bridge structure could be carried out. In July 2020 it was reported that, while the structure of the bridge had been reinstalled, \"several weeks of work\" were required before it would reopen. As of August 2020, the \"timeline for the reopening\" of the bridge was reportedly not known.\n\n\n== See also ==\nShakkin' Briggie (Over the River Dee in Scotland)\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fota Wildlife Park is a 100-acre (40 ha) wildlife park located on Fota Island, near Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland. Opened in 1983, it is an independently funded, not-for-profit charity that is one of the leading tourism, wildlife and conservation attractions in Ireland. The park had an attendance of 455,559 visitors in 2017, making it the eleventh most popular paid attraction in Ireland for that year.The park is home to nearly 30 mammal and 50 bird species. Some of the animals roam freely with the visitors, such as the ring-tailed lemurs and wallabies, while larger animals, including the giraffe and bison, live in paddocks with barriers that are intended to be unobtrusive for visitors to view the animals in a more natural environment. Fota Wildlife Park also has red pandas, tapirs, siamang gibbons and other types of animals.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nFota Island was the former home of the Smith-Barry family, descendants of Normans who came to Ireland in the 12th century. While the family's lands were originally more extensive, they dwindled over time until they were restricted to Fota Island. The estate was sold to University College Cork in 1975.In the meantime, Dublin Zoo had reached maximum development with the space available. So in 1979, the director of Dublin Zoo proposed to the Zoological Society of Ireland Council that a wildlife park should be established, and the site at Fota Island was proposed. The same year it was formally agreed that the society would establish a wildlife park at Fota. University College Cork offered the land free of charge under license agreement. Fota Wildlife Park became a joint project of the Zoological Society of Ireland and University College Cork. Fundraising committees were set up in both Dublin and Cork. All the funds for the development were raised from public subscriptions, apart from a grant from Bord F\u00e1ilte for the perimeter fence.\nThe first animals started to arrive to Fota Wildlife Park in late 1982, and Fota Wildlife Park was opened in the summer of 1983 by the then President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery.\n\n\n=== Further development ===\n\n\n==== Cheetah run ====\n\nCheetahs, by their nature, will not work for food if they do not have to, and to exercise the animals and for behavioural enrichment reasons, the park installed a \"Cheetah Run\" in 2006. This device suspends food items on a wire that travels 10 feet (3.0 m) off the ground, at approximately 65 kilometres per hour (40 mph).\n\n\n==== Education centre ====\nAs part of the park's conservation and education mandate, an education centre was opened, and runs courses on a range of topics including ecology and conservation. These are aimed at students at primary school and secondary school level, and the centre also runs summer camps during school holidays. Every year, an average of 15,000 students participate in Fota's education programmes.\n\n\n==== Big cats and tropical house ====\nFota Wildlife Park celebrated its 30th anniversary on 22 June 2013, and following this anniversary, announced the addition of a \"Tropical House\" and 27 acre \"Asian Sanctuary\". As of 2017, habitats for Sumatran tigers, Indian rhinos, lion-tailed macaques and Asian lions have been opened in the \"Asian Sanctuary\".\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nFota Wildlife Park has been awarded 'Best Family Day Out' for both Munster and Cork on several occasions. In November 2016, it was awarded 'Experience Destination of the Year' by Customer Experience Insights (CXi). It is also in the Top 25 Zoos/Animal Parks in Europe in the 2015 Tripadvisor Travellers Choice Awards.\n\n\n=== Television Show ===\nAs of early 2020, Fota Wildlife Park was featured in a documentary on Virgin Media Television. The series, called Fota: Into the Wild, was filmed at the park over two years as well as covering some of the broader conservation work the park's employees are involved in (with some filming involving projects in Madagascar and Romania).\n\n\n== Animals and habitats ==\n\nThe animals and birds at Fota Wildlife Park originate from a variety of habitats, a number of which are threatened with degradation through human activity. Fota runs the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for the Sudan cheetah and the European Studbook (ESB) for Lechwe (Kafue lechwe and Red lechwe).\nA number of sections of the park are arranged by habitat and region. These areas include the 'Asian Sanctuary' section, which houses the park's Sumatran tiger, Visayan spotted deer, Visayan warty pig, lion-tailed macaque, Indian rhino, and Asiatic lion. The 'African Savannah' paddock is home to ostrich, Grant's zebra, scimitar-horned oryx and Rothschild's giraffe breeds. When opened in 2014, the 'Tropical House' housed three reptile, nine amphibian, 28 fish and 14 butterfly species among 340 tropical plants. A number of aquatic bird species (including penguins, Chilean flamingos, and great white pelicans) are found in wetlands around the park's 'Monkey Island' section, which itself houses black howler, Colombian spider monkeys, and Siamang gibbon and lemur species. Some mammals and marsupials, like kangaroo, wallaby and mara species, roam somewhat freely within sections of the park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Extremely confusing. We booked for what we thought was a tour of the house but it was actually a tour of the wildlife park. The car park is 15 mins away from the house- waste of time. We paid \u20ac70 for tickets and we\u2019re still fleeced for \u20ac3 on the way out of the car park. The",
          "Visited Fota today. Park is fine but the ridiculous situation with the parking needs to be addressed. \u20ac3 that needs to be paid with coins on exit. No option to pay by card and ko attendants there to give change absolute chaos trying to exit the park as no one carries coins",
          "Had a lovely day in Fota - weather wasn\u2019t great but that didn\u2019t stop us. With Covid 19 there is a one way system in operation but there is plenty of space to walk about so you can stay well away from others . Beautiful wildlife park- wonderful selection of animals and they have",
          "Disappointing really, probably best for younger kids. Its really a zoo but nonetheless a pleasant walk around, staff are nice. You need 3 euro in coins to get out of the car park, which is ridiculous and causes delays as people don't have change. We went around it in a little",
          "Since I've been in Dublin zoo twice, I have to say, Fota Wildlife is ten times better to go to. Area is so well maintained, many many places for family picnics, plenty of cafes,shops or just a snack bars. Staff was very nice, area very clean. definitely a place ro be visited.",
          "We visited Fota today with 3 kids, 13, 10 and 9. We arrived at 9.45, no queue. Bit disppointed not to get a free map but otherwise everything was brilliant! I liked the one way system, plenty of hand sanitiser and the whole place is very clean. We were talking to a lovely zoo",
          "From start to finish we had the best day. Everyone and everything there done so well. One way system is brilliant. Staff were excellent and very approachable. My nephew who is 5 loves kangaroos and a lovely lady working there answered all his questions and told him the name of",

          "Would be great if we had kids with us however me and my partner felt it wasnt the best place. Lots of enclosures felt hard to look into. Not many indoor areas to buy food or drinks and the queue for the shop at the end was stupid. Overflow car park needs way more signage",
          "We just bought an annual pass due to COVID 19 and have had fantastic use out of it already with three young children. We\u2019ve taken their friends too and always had an enjoyable visit. There\u2019s great space for the animals and you get decent views of each of the them when",

          "The park in places was run down this monkey island enclosure was a disgrace . There was a poor bald eagle in an enclosure so full of grass and run down u couldn't see him. I found the map could being bit more straight forward. The rest if it was OK.",
          "I consider the caging of wild animals to be somewhat cruel. However, to be fair to Fota, the animal enclosures are generally large and well arranged. The animals were quite active and in my (amateur) opinion looked healthy and well looked after. The area of the park is quite",
          "Be prepared to walk for about an hour, although as we finished,we saw an extra charge tram that was not advertised anywhere. A lot of the animals were not visible for the first two thirds of the walk. The ones we saw were inactive, although there was lots of climbing",

          "I'd highly recommend Fota for a day out. The enclosures are large and allow the animals to roam. Where possible the animals wander freely among the public. The staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. It's a fantastic day out. I'll be back soon.",
          "Pros: Great day out for both kids and adults. Very clean and well kept. Nice cafe and little playground for small children. Picnic benches in the park. Great variety of animals and all easy to view in their natural surroundings. All animals look very healthy and well cared for.",
          "I went to Foto Island Wild Life park for my birthday last week and cannot say enough nice things about it. Alot of animals roam free and seem really happy. The place was clean and i found the food/drink are very reasonably priced. The staff are lovely and on hand for any",
          "Great selection of animals in decent size enclosures! Animals are well looked after evidences by the successful breeding programs. Zookeepers are very knowledgeable and the wildlife talks are held throughout the day. My particular favourite are the 2 Indian rhinos! Great day",
          "We had a lovely day here ..started with the coffee and cake offer in the cafe and then spent 2-3 hours in the place...a lovely leisurely walk round looking at all the animals. Afterwards we drove to Cobh and found John Doyle's pub and had a superb lunch and a wander round",
          "Last minute notion to go on the beautiful drive from limerick. From the moment of arrival there were stewards advising you where to park and where things were. They were polite and courteous and made a good first impression. Friendliest and strangely, the best looking staff",

          "We had a fabulous day out but please please stop your children from chasing and tormenting poor defenceless peacocks around the picnic area. It was horrible to watch and so unnecessary.",
          "We went early to avoid the crowds, it was really lovely, the animals get so close and there's loads to see! Definitely go if you can, brilliant for family days",
          "We just love Fota it\u2019s so accessible and has something for everyone. Lots of renovations and upgrading done over the winter so I\u2019m going to purchase a conservation pass again this year. Such good value for money. The perfect day out.",
          "We\u2019ve been here a few times in the last couple of years. It\u2019s a lovely day out with the family (especially if the weather is nice). The kids love to see the animals and we were lucky that we say a few of the animals being fed. The baby lions were a big hit with the kids too. It",
          "Spent the day with wife and 20mo daughter. Fantastic day out among the wild and confined animals. All enclosures are big, well cleaned lots of space to move for the animals. Keepers are all enthusiastic and well informed about the animals they tend to. I highly recommend that",
          "We booked the VIP Tour and had the privilege to be toured by Willy, the head warden of the zoo. Super-Fantastic is maybe the best way to summarize our experience. From the moment we booked to our actual tour, we had only the best experience. The Wildlife Park in itself it",
          "Brought family to Fota gardens Easter trail. Great morning there, at exit barrier put in money yet barrier didnt budge. Member of group went back to wildlife park steward for assistance on two occasions to no avail waited for well over 30 minutes. Eventually a rep from wildlife",
          "If you are traveling with kids and are looking for an outdoor activity that\u2019s family friendly, this park is perfect while visiting the Cork area. We went with our 11 year old and were pleasantly surprised at how big the park was. We are from the States but currently live in",
          "Lovely place to see some interesting animals. Good value for money. The cafe was nice & reasonably cheap. We all enjoyed it.",
          "Fota Wildlife Park is a zoo with ample space. I usually come away from this sort of thing with a feeling of guilt that animals are kept in enclosures too small. But one thing Fota Wildlife Park is not short on is space. The Park is well laid out and takes you on a walk through",
          "We spent the morning at Fota Wildlife Park and our experience far exceeded our expectations. There are many animals roaming freely and this was very exciting for the children. We were lucky enough to spend time with one of the guides and his passion and knowledge of the",
          "The park is nicely laid out with lakes and islands and generally good spacious enclosures for the animals. Quite interesting how some animals roam free, such as kangaroos and wallabies and also that some animals are mixed together such as zebras, giraffes and ostriches. We were",
          "expected a lovely day out for the whole family.There was 15 of us so we paid a lot to enter the place. As we went further into the park and especially the water areas the filth of the place became very apparent.The water was covered in faeces,the filtration system does not seem",
          "We visited the park one Saturday morning. We made a guided tour that allowed us to learn more about some of the animals that live there. We feed penguin, monkeys, rhinos and my favorite giraffes. Thanks to the guide that accompanied us, we were able to get to know the animals",
          "Fantastic day spent admiring the wildlife. From Tigers to Kangaroos to Rhinos, this place is a heavenly haven for the animals. Its so open, I was expecting the Giraffes to just walk past me as I wandered round. Kangaroos and Lemurs just lying about and scampering freely. Feels",
          "The place is excellent for the whole family,some of the animals roam free like the ringtail lemas.A great day out ,don't miss it.",
          "Would highly recommend the guided tours in fota. Your get to food the animals and see them up close. And the tour guide Willie is great with all the story and fact about the park. Will be back to do the tour again",
          "Although it was a little chilly on the day I visited, the animals were still all out and about and very active. It's nice to see them in larger enclosures that you could expect to see at other zoos in different countries. I definitely enjoyed visiting this park",
          "I was here maybe 10 years ago, and was so dissatisfied on my return visit today. Yes the weather was awful and the animals were all in hiding and that\u2019s understandable, but it seems to me that there is no investment in the place since I last visited, and if I compare to my",
          "After an all-day tour we had booked fell through, we decided to salvage our day by finding something to do with the remainder of our day. We discovered Fota Wildlife Park and were not disappointed. While this zoo is not very big (compared to our home\u2019s, San Diego Zoo!) it is",
          "Visited here in a cold but sunny day in Feb- there were very few other visitors on site so we moved about easily and got to see everything. It was a lovely walk in the sunshine and for the most part, the animals were up close so little people can easily see. There was lots of",
          "This is a great wildlife park. A lot more spaced out than Dublin zoo which i think is a better visit than Dublin zoo. Can Get very close to some animals.",
          "I visited here with my partner during the February midterm. There was small crowds which made it very easy to see the animals that were out. As it was quite cold on the day, a lot of the animals were taking shelter in the huts; in particular all the monkeys and the rhinos. It",
          "We are just home from The Warden Experience and could not wait to write this review. It was 100% the best thing we could ever spend our money on. Lesley our Warden was so lovely! She was so informative, so professional and it was wonderful to see how deeply she really cares",
          "It's a lovely walk. Really good for anyone. It was really cold and rainy when we visited so a lot of the animals weren't out but that's our own fault for going there in the freezing cold. It was still nice to walk around. It was very well kept. Hoping to go back in the summer.",
          "A great wildlife park set in the beautiful surroundings of Fota Island. The animal have lots of space to roam with kangaroos , peacocks, wallabies roaming freely. Animals we saw included- cheetahs, meerkats, red pandas, giraffes, zebras , monkeys , tigers , rhinos. Having",
          "Fota is a credit to its owners and those who maintain it. An outstanding array of wildlife and great to see the additions that are continually being made to the place: tigers and rhinos for example. This place is especially valuable for families with small children but I think",
          "We spent the morning here and loved every minute of it! My daughter 22months old had a blast getting up close with all of the animals. I'd definitely come back!",
          "Overall it\u2019s reasonable value. Relaxed, walking day out for the family on a nice day with the chance to see a good variety of animals. However, on our visit, it was hard to see a lot of the animals as they were hiding away. The gift shop (like most) is overpriced. The biggest",
          "I can't explain how much fota wildlife park is to cork city,it's very special indeed too the animals on the endangered species list,the people of cork,which I am a corkonian born here,I have been here many a time the staff and everyone envolved in this park should be highly",
          "Fota is a childhood favorite of mine and I still love it now in my adult life. Love seeing all the new babies. I think it\u2019s an amazing place for the animals they have so much room to roam and mix with each other. Fun for all ages.",
          "From the looks of it, Fota Wildlife has everything possibly needed to make the wildlife park exceptional but just missed the mark. Some animals didn't have enough space, others are within concrete blocks, with very little stimulation available to them. We visited in the dead of",
          "We travelled from kildare to Fota Wildlife park several weeks ago with our 4 children. It took just over 2 hours to get there, so we had a full day in Fota. We had a great day, the animals are all amazing and very obviously well cared for. We have a Dublin zoo annual pass",
          "my family has been a member of the park for a number of years. It is an ideal place to visit with children in all weathers; don't be put off by the mist or the rain, wind or hail. This modern wildlife park shows the animals off to full advantage. the walk is not that taxing.",
          "Foto wildlife park is a great day out for the family. Its easy to find, lots of parking (we went off season) and has good facilities. There are lots of animals to see frkm lions, hippos, peacocks, giraffes, zebras, roos, and lots of monkeys. The animals are well looked after and",

          "We loved our first trip to foto wildlife park it is definitely worth the trip very clean and you get up and close to the animal's. There are two restaurants picnic area toilets are kept moderately clean. We really enjoyed our visit.",

          "The animal Tour is fabulous. There are so many animals to see special during baby time Brilliant the way they have the feeding times set so you have a few time daily that you can have a look. Also there is enough seating area and play area for kids. The restaurant has an",
          "This is the second time this year we have been and its so good. We went anti clockwise and walked as far at the cafe, then got the train back, so got to experience everything. Brilliant! Cafe at half way point, utterly overpriced and below average food, we brought our own and",
          "One of the best wild life parks. Animals all in natural surroundings and close to the public. Easy to get round.",
          "Had such a lovely day at fota wildlife park. There is so much to see there you are really spoiled for choice. The best part is that you can see how well cared for the animals are. I would highly recommend fota as an afternoon out",
          "We just love this place. We haven\u2019t seen Any nervous animal in the park. The feeding time it is always fun for kids And adults too.",
          "Had a great time at this wildlife park, it has lots to offer. The area of the park is not too big (still expanding) takes about 1,5-2 hours to walk around. I specially enjoyed the tropical garden. Worth a visit.",
          "I've been to Fota many times and really enjoy the way the animals are in large areas and have plenty of space. They all appear well cared for, healthy and happy in their surroundings.",
          "This is a vast open space where you see lots of wild animals and its nicely laid out. While we were there we were treated to a spectacular display from the baboons behind a glass enclosure. One was hanging from a branch and as we were trying to get a closer picture, he suddenly",
          "We had our visit well planned to do in the day before heading to Seek at the fota Island Resort in the evening. I have to say it exceeded my expectations and dispute being a bit of a muddy, dull day it did not dampen our spirits. The meerkats were 1st stop and no where in sight",
          "Enough animals, with some rare ones like the forest with the big butterfly. Tigers was amazing, and who is tired from walking can take the small train back to entrance. there are two entrances one with car park and other-one beside train station. Worth to visit the fota gardens",
          "Bright November day and the animals looked interested and content or in the case of my favourite- the Tapir, very sleepy. The new educational viewing pod over looking the giraffe paddock was very impressive. Plus to top it off the hot chocolate from the cafe was offered with",
          "This\u2019s a lovely natural park with good enclosures and beautiful lake area. When we were there they were creating a new enclosure ready to welcome some new primates. You can tell a lot of work goes into making this a nice place to visit and also for the animals (many of which",
          "This is a great day out in cork, serious investment has been made in the park in the last few years and it\u2019s a completely different experience than it used to be. Fabulous for anyone to enjoy",

          "Fota is a great family day out for both the smallies and adults! You would spend the whole day exploring the zoo, from the monkeys to the giraffes to the tigers. The kids just love it, and as an adult I didnt find it boring at all. Staff are friendly and the zoo is so well kept.",
          "Great day in Fota! The only fault is the price it\u2019s on the expensive side for a large family. Train from cork city to fota, kids loved it. Lots of different animals, birds etc. Fab walk around. We spent around 3 hrs there altogether.",
          "An amazing place, great family fun day. Animals keep in great conditions.A must if visiting south of Ireland",
          "Oh my, almost two decades of countless places visited in Ireland and I don't know what took me so long to visit Fota Wildlife Park. This place is amazing! Absolutely wonderful. We were very lucky with the weather, a day full of sunshine and we spent hours exploring and having",
          "A day well spent in Fota Wildlife Park. We spent about 3 hours in the park altogether which included lunch and a very short visit to the gift shop. Having been in various zoos and on a safari, it was great to read about their conservation work and see how much space many of the",
          "We had a wonderful day out and spent most of the day in the Wildlife Park. So much to see! We went around on our own in the morning and had a most amazing afternoon in the company of Lesley. She was informative and understanding and went out of her way to insure we had a great",
          "We had such a wonderful time exploring the park with the children! All kinds of animals to see, and while I don't like zoos, for the most part this one felt slightly less awful than most zoos, since, for the most part, the animals were in wide open spaces and somewhat natural",
          "Fota Wildlife Park is a fantastic day out for both adults and children alike. Was there recently mid week with my little boy and we all had a fantastic Day viewing all the animals. If you want to feed the ducks make sure you have 50cent pieces and a little container to collect",
          "Fota is a great spot for a family visit. Make sure and have comfy shoes as it's all walking. half way around the park there is a great rest stop with coffee, pizza and lots of nice treats. Lots of animals to see. Be sure and get some duck food, you shall see a little machine",
          "Fota island is a great day out for the whole family, kids love going to see the animals and great if you get to see the cheetahs feeding time, plenty to do down there to keep the kids entertained",
          "I have been able to visit zoos all over the world and this is now my favorite. It is small but so well thought out. Many animals are loose, over 150 wallabies, 7 kangaroos and I saw 3 ring tailed lemurs, just sunning themselves on the road, under trees and on a fence post.",
          "Great day out... ideal for family and friends Children will love it... plenty of parking spaces.... great walks Can get the train directly from City",
          "There were four adults and one young child on this trip. From the moment we entered the gates I knew it was something special. As soon as you enter you are welcomed by a huge field full of different types of animals. We were just in time for the cheetahs feeding time. Brilliant,",
          "It was lovely to visit the photo wildlife park. we really enjoyed the trip end - to - end. The animals were awesome and the weather held up so that definately added to the experience.",
          "Fota is a great day out for everyone ,good walking shoes needed and a rain coat perhaps.Don't miss the butterfly house or the tigers and a picnic will recharge the energy levels.The Warden Experience is a great chance to see behind the scenes .",
          "I visited here in September having not been for a few years My daughter has special needs si when i said this i got in free and my daughter at half price I was delighted Since my last visit there has been lots of improvements The walk around is larger but there is a train trip",
          "Very interesting. I am mobility impaired so was provided with a wheelchair. Made the mistake of getting the train from the entrance so we could go for something to eat in the cafe at the far end of the park. We then had to back track to see some of the exhibits as the train made",
          "Beautiful place to visit in cork. Lots to do for kids. Beautiful walk around the park. Staff very friendly espically Aidan Rafferty who looks after the giraffes .He is very friendly +pleasant. Has a lovely restaurant to have a bite to eat. There is a lovely gift shop to buy a",
          "It\u2019s a nice park, but not really a big one. It would fit for a family day in the park, to see the animals. All and all a nice place to visit.",
          "I've been to zoos before and most of the time the animals are in relatively small enclosures but Fota is different.. Animals in large open enclosures where they're free to roam. Besides that the grounds are great to walk around in whether you're in the main wildlife area or the",
          "This was my first visit back to this park for a long time and I was glad to see that there is a lot of additions and a lot more to see than before,most of the animals have a large area in which to roam around,the food and prices are quite good,and the park is quite large.",
          "Took my little boy recently and didnt think much of it,alot of where animals were meant to be was empty and when we did see animals they were well distanced from us,also i dropped my little boys jacket in park and when i enquired about it at entrance desk the person wasnt any",
          "And no! The animals aren't bored, looking good (also penguins) and I think I don't see a Wildlife Park or a Zoo with so much ground for the animals. I come back!",
          "Very enjoyable.wide open spaces and great selection of animals.plenty of seating areas and places for children to play.",
          "Visited the park on Sunday last, it had been 12 months or more since our last visit. We were an extended family group of 7 adults and 5 children between the ages of 16 years and 18 months. We had an absolutely lovely visit, the weather was warm and sunny and we really enjoyed",
          "Spent a lovely afternoon here with my family. The grounds are so nice and even though the animals are secured behind fences there is a real free feel to the place. You can get close enough up to fences etc and the enclosures compared to Dublin zoo are so much bigger. One",
          "We had perfect weather for our trip to Fota last month and the day was just lovely. The entry fee is very reasonable, as are the prices in the gift shop. The animals look very well cared for and it seemed that the vast majority of them had plenty of space. Seeing the wallabies",
          "Fantastic day out ! Really impressive park it is very well run and lots of animals to see . The small fella loved it and to be fair adults will enough the day too!",
          "It was a perfect day out to enjoy sunshine, long walk and to have an opportunity to see these animals. It is definitely worth to visit if you have kids, is fun and you can learn a lot about about each animal.",
          "Pretty average wildlife park - wow this was advertised as one of the best wildlife parks with animals roaming around however what we experienced was anything but. You could barely see any animals and the restaurant left a lot to be desired. Messy and unkempt like the animals",
          "The park was alright, we went when the weather wasnt that great, was only in Cork for the day as we were passing through we planned to come to Fota, it rained alot so we didnt get to see most of the animals as they were hiding taking shelter from the rain which is fair. There",
          "Worth a visit and you get up close to the animals, however it's hit and miss whether they come out, good facilities and if you don't feel like walking they have a train for 2 euro.",
          "We went as a party of eight. The park itself is ok. We finished off in the gift shop, where \u20ac100 was spent. My child bought a teddy for \u20ac10.50, upon arrival home we discovered that it had a big hole in the arm. Rang the shop, explained the situation. Was asked why I didn't check",
          "Great spot to visit for all ages! Could spend the whole day here! We didn't get to see the Zebras up close as there was work going on. Other than that we had a great day & it's reasonably priced! Would highly recommend!",
          "As a kid, I used to love going to the zoo, as I am a huge animal lover. As an adult, I\u2019m starting to realize I really don\u2019t enjoy as much anymore. I always try and keep my child-like sense of wonderment about me, especially when I visit new places and attractions, but with zoos",
          "Visited here last year and I must say it was great. The kids loved it and I would definitely return again. It was a little cold but it was that time of the year so that was expected.",
          "We have been going here since our kids were small we still love going there. There have been such good changes and improvments over the years. We try and go as many times in the year as we have a Conservation ticket. It's well worth it. It is really lovely walking around Fota I",
          "Went there on a Saturday and got very lucky with the weather - you can see plenty of animals roaming around freely and the park is enough to spend about 3 hours to walk through it - I think it is worth the price",
          "We went to FOTA Wildlife Park with a 2 yr old as we were staying in Fota Island Hotel. The men in our company went golfing. The weather was perfect for our trip. [Late Aug 2018]. We paid \u20ac12.50 for 3 adults which was a concession price from hotel. Children up to 3yrs are free.",
          "My wife and I brought our 3 year daughter to Fota during June and found it to be a great day out. We had not been to Fota before ans found it had a bit for all ages. Next time we are in Cork we will likely return.",
          "10 euro entry fee including one activity. 5 euro if you are lucky enough to get pigs back.com voucher that was on offer for July & Aug 2018. Fota is done up quite a bit. The houses could do with a link of paint but the kids don't see that. They had a ball. Swimming. Crazy golf.",
          "This was my second visit, not as well received as last year. Not as many guides, and not much wildlife as last year. My grandsons were quickly bored.",
          "We have been to FOTA a few times as we have a zoo pass. We feel the place has really improved and we had a fantastic trip this year. The highlight was definitely the tropical house, it is really well done and the butterflies flying around were amazing. We spent ages in there! We",

          "Great place to take children for the day. Plenty of animals to see and lots of space for children to run around. The children love walking around and seeing animals so close, and there is a playground for them when they get tired of walking. Allow a good few hours there as there",
          "Lots of animals to see. Good facilities and not too busy. It\u2019s easy to stroll and enjoy all the enclosures. Fun to see some of the animals like peacocks and lemurs freely roaming . Great for a family day out too.",
          "great place to visit we have no young children but i would say your kids would love it. loads to see and do.",
          "Animal enclosures could do with a bit more focus on animals. Sad to see a giraffe eating a plastic bag",

          "Really enjoyed our afternoon here.. very easy layout to walk around to ensure you see everything. Lots of photo opportunities too! Even though we had no children we enjoyed it. Weather was in our favour too! Only disappointment was that there were no elephants when we were",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Its lovely to see animals roaming free around compared to a zoo and I noticed its expanding and upgrading. You can purchase bird food for 50 cent and feed the ducks/geese from your hand. Its easy to find on the map abd not far from Cobh. There are",
          "Son and I visited. They have an autism and carer entry rate. The grounds are mostly flat and all the animals were close to the viewing area. Gorgeous tigers, lions, cheetahs, but the bird/duck area felt like I was just at a duck pond rather than a zoo",
          "We were a group of 3 adults and 4 children. Our youngest daughter is 5 and a wheelchair user and the park is totally accessible for wheelchairs. We entered the park and bought 4 maps for the children. We had a really lovely day. Towards the end you come to the giraffe crossing.",
          "It's been many years since we had visited Fota Wildlife park but it's really greatly improved since then. Much better signage and very clean well maintained pathways. The cafe's and restaurants have improved as well and the wardens were very visible and open to chatting and",
          "Visited here numerous times , latest this week with my sister's and nieces and nephews. The children were delighted to see the animals up close , a well any jumped across the path in front of me band nephew. Children loved to feed the ducks . Much better experience for children",
          "A great zoo with animals running free or visable. The wild flowers and old trees were fantastic and well done for preserving these areas. I will suggest an upgrade of Foto; After 14 years between visits very little has changed! The zoo was great fun for the children but only",
          "The closest I\u2019ve ever been to a giraffe, (they are so far away in the zoo usually). Definitely worth the visit if only to see them. Easy to walk around. Cheetahs being fed was amazing. (4pm). 100% worth a visit.",
          "Lovely day out with kids and friends. Been here before they do there best in keeping the animals a good habitat without be totally free in the wild. Nice place for the family.",
          "I have been to several zoos around the world, but I loved this one. This park has do e an excellent job of settling their animals in surroundings similar to their natural habitats. They also have plenty of room. The walking trails are excellent, and even a visitor in a",
          "Hadn't been here in years. Lots to see and lots of nice areas with a variety of animals. Spent a good few hours walking around and the weather was lovely which helped. Train let's you off just at the entrance to the park, which is handy. Price was cheap. Would definitely come",
          "We have a tradition of going every year for my daughters birthday. Her grandparents come along and sometimes her cousins. Loads to see now it has been done up. Lots more animals have been added -lions, tigers and rhino. We really enjoy it.",
          "Fantastic experience, much better than Dublin zoo. Animals are much closer. Kangaroo loose among the visitor's. Restaurant at the main entrance a disappointment though .",
          "Good day out for children and families. If we must have Zoos then at least the animals here have more space than traditional Zoos. Seems a shame to have to say this but additional staff are required to monitor the activities of some children whose parents cannot be bothered to",
          "The last time that we visited Fota was over ten years ago and we were pleasantly surprised with how much it has changed since then. If you are looking for a family day out in cork I couldn\u2019t recommend Fota highly enough. We will definitely be back..",
          "Great family day out they have improved and added to this place over the years well worth a visit. There is on site coffee shop and cafe or you can bring your own picnic highly recommend",
          "Really great park. Way better than Dublin Zoo. You will not be disappointed if you visit. Lots of walking but there is a train if you aren\u2019t up to walking a lot.",
          "We had a lovely morning here, we walked around to see all the animals. Saw a mother kangaroo with her joey in her pouch that was cool. We were there for a morning, think that is all you need really. Overall lovely experience especially with younger ones. They do have",
          "So I went to fota with my friends and we loved it . There is so many animals and things to do . We loved the tropical house and the giraffes . There is lots to do for little kids as well . Really worth the visit \ud83d\ude4c",

          "Since I live locally, I have visited many times. Fota is one of my favourite places in the world to go, it's very different to any zoo I have ever visited. The enclosures are wide and spacious for the animals of which there is a wide variety. In the last few years impressive new",

          "Even though the weather was completely against us when we visited, it was a brilliant family day out. Loads to see and do, and everyone had a brilliant time. The place is tired looking but work is ongoing to improve it, and it didn't take away from the wonder of being so close",
          "Really enjoyed our visit. Paths are all very suitable for a buggy and good baby changing facilities on site. We spent about 2 hours walking around and there were a few playground stops along the way which was great as it kept our toddler entertained. We saw all the animals that",
          "WE went to Fota Island with 2 six year olds ON MONDAY August 6th. We have gone there every year but I found this time you walked farther to see less animals. Everywhere needs a spruce up. We were disappointed as a lot of the animals were not visible and the biggest group of",
          "Super spot to go with kids as you can get so close to the animals and the kids got to see the kangaroos and lemurs running free in the park. Book online so much easier",
          "Major developments over last few years.. A nice family buzz for day out. Various VIP packages available but the seem pretty expensive..",
          "Quite simply a must do for visitors and locals. All I can really say is just visit here enjoy the scenery and animals. If you get really lucky you may even get followed about by some of the residents. I\u2019ll keep who a surprise for you.",
          "We visited here on 26 July and unfotunately for us and other visitors that day there was a burst pipe which meant the water supply was cut off to Fota. We weren't told about this on the way in, there were some signs up but it wasn't pointed out. The impact of this was that the",
          "We visited Fota Wildlife this week for the day and loved it, all the animals are visible and have space to roam... in my opinion it\u2019s much better than Dublin Zoo, Dublin Zoo is so commercialized and every corner you turn something is been sold or there is another playground! The",
          "Relaxing, interesting, Kids love it. Adults enjoy it too. While on fota you should visit Fota House and Gardens.... well worth a visit",
          "Relaxing, fun, safe, well layed out with lots to see for all the family. Kids really enjoyed their day out as did we. Would highly recommend the trip here. Lots of parking and reasonably priced. Restaurants/cafes spread out around the park with clean facilities. Well run",
          "Went with friends. Great day out Had very good weather and really enjoyed the animals,the walk and the atmosphere Great family destination",
          "We did the VIP tour of Fota on Wednesday morning with Willie and I've literally got nothing bad to say about our experience. Willie was a character and fantastic with the kids. His knowledge of the park and animals is second to none. The animals themselves seem to love him",
          "We had a great day out here at fota. The park itself is beautiful and the animals are just amazing. The staff were really friendly, face painting and arts and crafts included for the kids. Little train ride around the park as well for when your legs get sore. Lots of toilet",
          "We enjoyed during our visit with my kids and they really enjoy with all the animals well organize and clean. Worth the money plus good exercise for walking",
          "We have a park conservation membership which is well worth the investment- have had fabulous days out here since I got it - kids love it - no such thing as bad weather in Fota only bad clothes ! Wrap up and go anyway",
          "Great park, animals have loads of freedom, clean and well laid out. Lots of benches to rest for people who may need it. Food and coffee facilities nice. Great day out...only gripe is the car parking charge in addition to entry fee!!",
          "We as a family all enjoy going to fota. On a good summer's day it great to walk around to pass the day",
          "We visited as a family with young adults and all enjoyed the layout, pace and variety of this park. There was plenty to see and we were struck by the numbers of giraffes and cheetahs in particular. Lovely day out and reasonably priced",
          "Whas there with two teenagers and thy was enjoying time in there. Feeding ducks and traying to catch kangaroo.",
          "Fabulous day to be had at fota island we\u2019ve been here a couple of times with our now sixteen year old and our three year old both really enjoyed it",
          "We visit Ireland every few years and we never miss the chance to go to Foto Wildlife Park. The Park is an incredible experience and a very unique opportunity to see Kangaroos, Giraffes, an many other animals up close. Really a great experience for the kids and the cafe serves",
          "Was only here once but will be back. It's not to far of a drive from the city centre. It's a fun family day out you can't really go wrong with it and not to expensive.",
          "Just back from a visit Saturday gone with my family mixed age group. Always a lovely day out when we visit great for everyone bring buggys for small kids as it's a good day of walking.",
          "We went here on Saturday past. It was wet and miserable so we weren't hoping for much. We greeted by a nice girl at the till. 16euro an adult (bit expensive). When you walk in you see the beautiful area where the giraffes are. The sun came out and it lit up the park. The animals",
          "Arrived in park early in the morning and it seemed like we had park to ourselves. Animal enclosures are kept clean and well maintained. Great to see animals roam in big open spaces. Kids loved the variety of animals big and small. Alot of construction going on so looks like it's",
          "Great day out but dissatisfied with car park charges and map of park charges after parting with 57euros for2 adults an 2 students",
          "We visited with a group of older people they thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience staff were good to deliver and collect our food boxes it was amazing to see everyone enjoying the amazing animals",
          "Lil expensive but worth travelling. We were a group of like 13 people it was nice seeing nature and kangaroos outside the cage lol . Definitely will go back .",
          "Got there about 11am traveling from Kildare so not worth the 2 hour trip. The habitats look really run down. Most of the animals we couldn't see them and there was more birds around than anything else. I will say there was a few things nice about the place the penguins are",
          "Had a great time at fota wildlife. Enjoyed the cheetah feeding show. Nice atmosphere. Loads of animals to see. Not too cramped or over crowded and animals looked well cared for and had lots of room for themselves. Enjoyable day",
          "there's a lot of walking but its so worth it, wear comfy shoes! i was there with 3 kids and after 3 and a half hours we still hadn't seen everything and were exhausted from walking all the meandering paths, my 7 yr old all but gave up.. we walked all around the place but found",
          "Been here numerous times and it is absolutely fantastic every time we go his place keeps improving and improving!",
          "Spent 4 hours here!! the children loved it! would highly recommend ! we got the family ticket ..was well worth it! They ran around happily & freely while parents enjoyed fabulous coffee!",
          "On a trip to Cork we had to visit Fota as it was recommended by so many to us. Our kids love animals especially my son. Fantastic weather when we visited so it was a fun day out. Unfortunately most of the big cats, my son\u2019s favourites, were lying in the shade from the baking",
          "It has been at least 20 years since my last visit here. And my mother wanted to go cos it had been years for her to and my partner had never been, so the three of us hopped in the car and off we went. We paid our way in. And I was a little sore about the price but only for a",
          "Visited just after opening time park was lovely and quiet. Good selection of animals, Asia section is a good addition since my last visit",
          "Great day out with a great range of animals from big to small. Try to time it to see the Cheetah Run at 1245, it's impressive.",
          "Wonderful enjoyable day out with my friends lovely getting up close with all the animals can't wait to come here again",
          "We visited Fota today with our nearly 5 year old daughter who has type 1 diabetes. I contacted bookings in advance as I had heard there was a lot of walking and that scooters etc were not allowed. This was a concern for us as exercise lowers my daughters blood sugars rapidly",
          "Spent a few leisurely hours here last week with my Family. So much to see here and time is your own. Bring a picnic, plenty of areas to sit, or visit the snack shop's. This Park is really visitor friendly",
          "There was no people and the animals were really close. I think it is the best zoo I have ever been to.",
          "Our family of four made a visit here, and enjoyed ourselves very much! The grounds are large, so there is a good deal of walking involved. The animal enclosures were spacious, but offered great views of all the animals. We took the recommended route, which moves you counter",
          "It had been a few years since we last visited Fota Wildlife Park & it has expanded so much! Always an enjoyable day, a lovely walk around the park admiring the animals. There were even a few furry friends roaming out an about with us...please be respectful though and do not",
          "Visited fota today with 2 young children. The park was spotless, there were numerous keepers around the place asking had we any questions and explaining about the animals and their habitats, we found this really helpful. All the animals appeared well cared for, the children",
          "Just back from a day out at Foto wildlife park. Unfortunately Foto wildlife park is not Autism friendly at all. Our son has special needs and Autism and there was big crowds there was waiting for the train our son had a meltdown and threw himself on the ground as he didn't",
          "If you are on the Cork area and looking for somewhere to bring the kids, you won't go wrong with Fota Wildlife Park. There is lots to see and do at Fota to keep kids entertained. From the playground where parents can relax with a coffee from the nearby eatery, to the animals and",
          "Visited in 2015 and though it was advertised on billboards all around Cork \"King of The Jungle at Fota\", there was no Tiger to be seen. There was evidence of newly built viewing areas. There were other interesting attractions e.g. the humid tropical house with exotic",
          "Fota did not fail to deliver, wide range of animals to see and keep our bog group amused, we spent the entire day just wandering around the park. Clear to see that improvements are still being made.",
          "When my children were small we would visit Fota every Saturday . I wasn\u2019t there for years so I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements. Fota is fabulous keep up the great work guys \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d",
          "As always a great day out for all . It was a play date trip for my daughter and two friends. All delighted with the animals and playgraround and of course the train ride.",
          "Very nice. Perfect place for all family. For a big and small. Huge territory, loads of animals and birds. Our girl was so happy feeding birds there. Great day out.",
          "Brought a group of 10-15 yr old scouts to the Wildlife Park, and had a guided tour of the park which was about 2.5hrs. The guide was very good and knowledgeable and was able to answer all the kids questions. Everyone enjoyed the visit.",
          "We went to Fota Wildlife Park for the day with our 4 kids and everyone had a fabulous day out. It was much larger than I was expecting and there were lots of animals to see. The kids enjoyed the train ride to see all the animals. I would highly recomend this place for a day out.",
          "Recently visited Fota Wildlife Park. Nice zoo. Staff very nice. Alot of animals spread out in the area. Only problem is there should be more staff around the areas to guide people. Big variety in the shop there too.",
          "We had a great time at fota. The place is gorgeous with a great variety of animals . There was even free face painting for the kids when we were there. Plenty of picnic areas . Train wasgreat. It was fab to be able to see some of the animals being fed too and brilliant that",
          "We took our two teenage kids and both our mom\u2019s and did the VIP family experience. LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. Willie was a fabulous guide and getting a chance to feed a Rhino made us all as happy as could be. My son loves penguins so feeding them made him glow. Neither of our",
          "Great place to visit with little ones with a love for learning. The grounds are really well kept. I would recommend bringing a buggy though as the walk can be long.",
          "I have been coming too Fota Wildlife Park for years when I was a child and now I make it a trip fro my small boy and he loves it as much as I loved it and still love it the animals are very good can\u2019t wait too go down again",
          "Beautiful place to be in the sun kids love it animals are in good viewing spots great walk around the park visit about four times a year",
          "We went to Fota wildlife park as a large family group of both adults and small children and we had a great day out.The animals end birds were in prime condition with lots of space and all seemed happy and content.lots of places for children to play.Only downside was that the",
          "As soon as I entered I wanted a refund and the rest of the visit proved that I should have asked for one. If you have been to a real wildlife park you ride in a car or on a tram and the animals roam all around you. The misleading hype for Fota gave me the impression that this",
          "was something handy to do whilst in cork. the weather made it a fab day, and we timed it so we get to see the cheetahs feeding, which was the highlight i suppose. the butterfly enclosure was different too, a nice day spent here to be fair. the price was reasonable.",
          "The animals are well looked after and while i'm not a huge fan of zoo's or animals in captivity the enclosures seem to be of a decent size for the resident wildlife.",
          "If anyone thinks this is a fun family day out, they are clearly not thinking about the animals. None of the animals have proper enclosures, all the grass is overgrown etc, they all look so incredibly miserable. The penguins have little water, they were losing their hair and",
          "Was here many years ago, and finally got the chance to return last week. This place has really grown in size, involves a lot of walking so wear comfy shoes. The weather was amazing and it was very hot. The only animals we didnt get to see was the loins as they were staying in",
          "Great day out for the family,keep up the great work you are doing fota! The place is really well kept,staff are really friendly and helpful",
          "This place is a must if your in Cork. Great for the kids but also great for the older teenagers. Very well laid out and animals look healthy and happy.",
          "This is not actually as good as the photos, it is good but once was enough for our kids. It is a very long walk and you have to pay to use the little train to go around after paying to get in, it was a bit money grabbing.",
          "We visited Fota on a lovely sunny sunday! the park is amazing and we saw so many animals! it is a lovely walk around. it took us 3 and half hours. it is def worth the money",
          "Really enjoyable day, at the amazing wild life park, spread out across archer of land, with a great variety of wild life tigers , loins zebra, ostriches, giraffes, naming just a few. At 5pm you can view the giraffes being housed for the night as they automatically cue up on time",
          "The Animals are very well kept and seem happy! Which is always nice, but the restaurant/cafe is very expensive with few healthy options! The gift shop is also quite expensive, but both of these aren\u2019t necessities to the trip! Overall great!",
          "Awful place. Incrediblebly cruel for animals. Monkey was banging his head against a rock. Rhinos and giraffes look lost. Most of the animals look sad",
          "It had been a while since I was at Fota so was looking forward to returning. As Ireland was basking in a heatwave it must have been the hottest day of the year so far when we visited. Luckily it was not too crowded and was comfortable walking about. The park is well",
          "we are so lucky to have this zoo within 20 minutes of our house, but we're moving soon and we'll miss the close-to-the-animals experience you get here. the kids love it and it's always a well-kept facility. the animals look as happy as can be too, which makes all the difference.",
          "Better than any Irish zoo I have visited! Very spacious areas for the animals too and they seem well cared for and looked after. Staff are friendly and helpful. Good day for any age group.",
          "While there seems to be work ongoing in some areas, other areas seem mostly neglected. Some of the animals that used to roam wild are now missing (health and safety issues, I am told) I don't know what was supposed to be in the glassed compound adjoining the cafe veranda. It",
          "Would recommend for a family day out, friendly staff and great open spaces for the animals. Will look forward to returning!",
          "Easily accessed off the motorway, second entrance after the hotel. There is plenty of parking, coffee and gift shop at entrance. I was surprised at the amount of animals to view at the park, I was very impressed. We enjoyed an oven cooked pizza beside the tiger enclosure. I",
          "Absolutely brilliant day out. We were 4 adults and a toddler and everyone had fun. Got terrified by cheetahs as we watched them eat, were followed by giraffes alongside the fence and fell in love with 2 playful seals. Food not great so definitely bring a picnic but plenty of",
          "Good place to go out with kids, train station right outside of the door and allot of things you can do inside. My son loved all the animals and walk. Highly recommended.",
          "The enclosures a very big so it is quite difficult to see a lot of the animals. Most enclosures were just the same monkeys over and over again. The tropical house had hardly anything in it and only saw one butterfly. Seeing the pelicans and the giraffes was so close was great",
          "It's expensive, the little train is not included, and we hardly saw any animals whatsoever! All we saw were signs stating animals were in the enclosure, but no animals! It was a very expensive waste of time. My husband wanted to ask for our money back, that's how bad it was.",
          "I couldn't count the amount of times I've visited Fota. Fota Wildlife Park is fantastic for children and adults of all ages. I have gone there multiple times in a week with children with disabilities and have always found the staff to be helpful and discrete. One of my",
          "Fota beautiful, children can get up close to some animals,you need to be able to spend a few hours walking around. well worth a visit. Bring a picnic",
          "Went for a family day out.Can say enough about this place.It has got to be on every families to do list when visiting Cork.Animals are healthy looking and active wkth some interactive areas.My top favourite is the Butterfly House.Do not forget your camera while visiting here.",
          "I love it here. It was over cast but staff and the animals were in top form. Food served was good too although we did bring a picnic. Children will love it",
          "My girls got me a behind the scenes pass for Fota wildlife park for Christmas as I love animals. I went with my husband & we stayed 2 nights in Cobh so we could relax. We arrived at the park @9.45am. At 10am we went to the office & we were greeted & welcomed by Willie who was to",
          "Nice place to go with family. A fine day is needed. Found it hard to see some animals due to weather. Its doesn't take very long to complete. But was a nice visit",
          "Visited Fota on the bank holiday weekend and I must say I was quite disappointed. The areas around the animal enclosures have been sprayed with roundup !!! in a wildlife park this is just unbelievable. I mean there are scores of children coming through there each day for",
          "Myself and my partner had privilege of under going the warden experience . If you\u2019re an animal lover like myself this is one of the best things you can do . The tour was ran by Willy who was just incredible he had a wide knowledge of the animals , the park , cork history and was",
          "My trip here was amazing as the walk is great and the animals are amazing, I would definitely return here and bring friends as this is a great place for a walk and to see the wildlife.",
          "My husband and I stopped here on a cruise. We did it on our own. The trip was super easy because the train station in Cobh was just steps from the pier and the park was just steps from the Fota train stop (3rd stop from Cobh). The park was large ad had many free roaming",
          "First impression on entrance wasn't great - not much to see for the first half hour or so with all the big cats hiding in the shade. However, as the trek wound on, there was increasingly more wildlife to get up close to including peacocks, pelicans and wallabies. Great views of",
          "We brought our 2 year old here today! I\u2019ve been impatiently waiting to bring him here for a while so it was great to bring him today! He loved the birds, monkeys and kangaroos! It\u2019s so lovely to be able to walk freely here. It\u2019s bigger now than I remember with the Tropical house",
          "Absolutely love fota since I was a child. I love that my girls can experience the park.it is Expensive but worth every penny.annual membership is worthwhile though.the recent expansions are fantastic. Plenty of seating for picnic time.",
          "Have been going here since I was a child and still love it. The animals have more space and freedom to roam than zoos. Very safe, great for families and children of all ages. Perfect place to go when the sun is shining.",
          "Fun for people of all ages, have been multiple times and each time I love it. Their recent expansion is great, now boasting lions, tigers and rhinos, amongst many other animals. Lots of walking but there is a little train type thing that can ferry you around all the exhibits.",
          "For Christmas I was giving a present of a voucher for the \"behind the scenes\" experience and wow!! It was the most amazing thing I have done. Willie the gentleman who showed us around was superb, he talked about the history of fota and brought us to different animals to feed",
          "We have not visited in 5 years or so. This visit surprised us as it has been vastly expanded and much improved. A great family day out.",
          "Hadn't been there in over 20 years and was better than I remember. Only fault with it was the minimal food choices, but this could have been down to the time of the visit. Will be going back again though.",
          "A lovely place, very spacious and looks like they are making improvements, only one thing, if the little train made more stops to allow people of limited mobility to see more of the park, other than that it was great.",
          "Fota Wildlife Park is well worth the trip. Easy to park, spacious surroundings and animals that look comfortable in the environment. As you enter, immediately there are giraffe to see and they just look at home! Great day for the family.",
          "I was visiting with my toddler and a friend and arrived with the train from cork. We found the engrance there but it was locked and no one arrived even after buzzing the bell.we then had to walk around which is good 20min so pretty long walk especially if your kid is not very",
          "I visited the wildlife park with my Grandchildren and was delighted to see their excitement as they saw and identified the different animals. The wide open spaces for the herbivores was great and the cheetah enclosures were enjoyable. The restaurant / refreshment area was",
          "A perfect place for a family day out. A superbly laid out conservation wildlife park where all the animals have wonderful space to be themselves while still allowing people to view and interact with them. The cafe prices are very reasonable and there are places to sit and relax",
          "I was very curious to go there and i have to say despite the awful weather i really enjoyed it. Lots of animal species and wide space where they can stay and most of all the free kangaroos that you can meet along the road and all the ducks and birds and lemurs free all around. I",
          "Went with my family it cost 55 euro to enter the park now in saying that it is what it is not a lot going on to b honest was disappointed nowhere nice to eat won\u2019t b rushing back there and to top it off you then have to pay 3 euro to exit the park now that\u2019s a joke they should",
          "I've visited the zoo and I saw a lot of animals it was a good experience.Not sure if animals like being locked up tho.But it's nice for visitors.",
          "Went to fota weekend before Easter . I had previously been about 20 years ago however it was a pleasant surprise. It is basically a zoo and not like other safari parks such as Woburn and Longleat in UK however it is still a great family day out. I remembered it being much more",
          "A great place to have a great time with friends and family. Easy to follow the map to view all the animals.",
          "I thought fota would be more of a kid friendly park or like the zoo i was completly wrong they cater for absaloutely anybody a must see for any animal lover you can even care for the animals yourself great array of animals like cheetahs red pandas kangaroos alot of wild life",
          "This park is on par with Dublin Zoo. Fantastic layout, intuitive maps, friendly zookeepers and tasty food. There is also a 5star, luxury hotel on the island in which you can stay. 5 stars.",
          "Visited here during the May Bank Holiday weekend. A fab day out. Spent a good 5 hours walking around and seeing all the animals. Great time had by all.",
          "My boyfriend and I visited the wildlife park during the bank holiday weekend and had a fantastic time. It was amazing to see so many free-roaming animals in the park and had a fantastic afternoon out. The park was easily accessible from where we were staying in Cork city centre,",
          "We really enjoyed our day out yesterday but we were disappointed with the overflowing bins and the park in general needed TLC with cleaning. The lake was smelly perhaps needs attention. Reception staff was welcoming and we were pleased to be able to use conservation membership",
          "Fab day out, cannot fault. Kids loved it, especially seeing the cheetahs run. Worth all the hype. Recommended!",
          "Super day with the kids very good great family day out at this stage I think the kids know all the animals names we will be back for sure",
          "Nice day out with the family. Lots to see and do. Highly recommended . There is a playground for children a train that brings you around the park, cafe and gift shop.",
          "We have been going for years and have an Annual Pass with our son its a lovely walk to see all the animals and it's always different. Our only gripe is that the overflow carpark has never been properly surfaced and if its heavy rain it's easy to get stuck.",
          "Fota wildlife park has expanded in size .. great day out for kids ..family .. friends ... go early as parking is tight .. busy place on good weather days .adult prices a little on the high side ..but never the less its still a far more relaxed and better than dublin zoo ... ..",
          "A great family day out, can be windy so be prepared. The restaurants can be busy so a picnic is a good alternative",
          "We were delighted that Fota lives up to all of our expectations. the animals are in large cages/paddocks and well looked after by a skilled group of caring keepers. The Cheetah run (Twice a day) should not be missed, there is also a number of free roaming animals which include",
          "We visited Fota on 21st April and we had a fantastic time. We did the behind the scenes tour and Willie Duffy who led the tour could not have been more helpful. He was a mine of information about the park and the animals and we got to handfeed giraffes, a rhino, penguins,",
          "Nice for families and for groups. There's lots for kids to do e.g. playground. But Fota's equally nice for adults. I went with friends and we were there for several hours, nice to just keep strolling around observing the beautiful animals.",
          "We visited Fota last week whilst staying in Cork city. It was a beautiful day and the park is well presented , easy to find and has ample parking. It was relatively quiet when we arrived and we walked the circuit over a few hours . the park is pleasant. But as we live in a rural",
          "Fota Wildlife Park has it all. A beautiful park with a huge variety of animals. Wonderful to see kangaroos, meerkats and peacocks roaming freely around the park. Beautifully kept park, with a great coffee shop as well as fast food restaurant. Highly recommend Fota for every age,",
          "I recently visited the Fota Wildlife Park and had the extreme misfortune to find my son had accidentally closed the car door leaving all our stuff inside and the child lock security preventing any access. I found myself and my son in a real pickle and without the help of Sinead",
          "Really enjoyed heading back to Fota wildlife park having not been there for nearly 20years. Lovely to see the kangaroos and meerkats roaming free and most of the animals having large enclosures to enjoy. The park is quite large and it does involve quite a bit of walking unless",
          "Very good place! It\u2019s perfect for children. There are many animals from different parts of the world. If you want a funny day off with family, go there!",
          "Visited with large group, ages 4-50+. Everyone enjoyed it very much. Cafe in middle of park had great pizza (Volcano, a local company) and Coffee. Well worth a visit!!",
          "Animals all free uncaged and some even walk with you. Brilliant. Brought two 9 year old boys who were amazed to stand 3 foot from a kangaroo with it's baby in it's pouch, with no fence. Animals really well minded. Lots of parking. Great garden arboretum next to it also and that",
          "If you want to get up close and personal with the animals then this is the place to visit.It is so vast with so many different species that you wouldn't realize how far you had walked.",

It\u2019s fantastic to see the park improvements with each visit (red pandas were in a new spot this visit). Hopefully the park will look",

          "A really lovely day out with or without kids. A lot more to see than Dublin Zoo so was delighted it didn\u2019t disappoint us. We had all ages with us and all agreed the same. Mid way was a lovely place to sit and eat ice cream and home made pizza which was lovely. Playground",
          "We booked the tickets online. \u20ac16.50. At this price it is definitely worth it. The walk followed recommended route is just under 3 miles. Everything is easy to walk around. It's nice to see the animals out. Only a few where in cages. There are some works going on. There are",
          "Having left Cork the year before Fota opened, I was totally unaware of the variety of the wildlife in this huge park. The paths were all tarmac or gravel and we had no problems pushing the pram that with our 1 year old niece. We were able to stop and have lunch at one of the",

          "Fota is a wonderful experience for young and old alike. if you are in the area it a must see, they have extended and improved Fota a lot in the last few years. There are a lot of wonderful animals to see, the feeding of the giraffes is always amazing, on a nice day it is even",
          "We visited the park and thankfully it had stopped raining. It was very easy to walk around and lots to see, some animals were walking around the park not in an enclosure but totally safe. It felt like the animals were not caged or restricted in any way. It was a very family",
          "Loved all the effort and detail put in to make sure animals feel as free and happy as they can ! Full of little surprises! Can\u2019t wait to have kids so I can take them there :D well done !",
          "Went here on a few occasions with both family, friends and hubby. Lovely stroll around to see the animals.",

          "Absolutely unreal gorgeous place. Animals are up close it's so cool. Kids loved it and Adults loved it",
          "By U.S. standards this is a small zoo. It has lots of exhibits where the animals run free, which is nice. Make sure not to miss the Cheetah run at 12:30 pm. They literally have a machine which makes the animals run to catch their food and its really fun to watch. Other than",
          "The animals were mostly resting until this fine upstanding warden told us we could follow him whilst he fed some of the animals. Wow we had a great time and all of the animals came out. Great fun with the spider monkeys and the lions.",

          "We go to Fota Wildlife Park every couple of months, it\u2019s a really nice place to walk and you can get pretty close to the animals. Fota is kept nice and clean and the staff are friendly and outgoing. The food in the restaurant area is not bad compared to other places we have",
          "I visited this wildlife park on more than one occasion while living in Cork. It is a great family venue. Wear comfortable shoes because it is a quite large. They also have a ride you can take advantage of at certain times I believe. I went with friends the first time and then",
          "We went here for my partners birthday and decided to take the Behind the Scenes tour since we all love animals. Wow was it worth it! We got taken around the zoo by one of the keepers, fed the giraffes (see photo), fed monkeys, fed penguins, even fed the rhinos (very sloppy",
          "Well worth a visit. We took out membership and taking friends and family who come to visit us. Young animals include giraffe, cheetahs, tiger, lion cubs, flamingo. Can spend a happy few hours walking round.. loads of animals to see. Plenty spots for picnics.",

          "Fota is amazing great day out. It's safe so the kids can run wild. Only think is the food in the restaurant at the top of the park is a rip off. Bring your own and have a picnic. It will be nicer. And I'm not being cheap it's disgusting and expensive.",
          "Went here a good few times I the summer beautiful place to go with kids or without place is always spotless",

          "My family, including two teenagers, went to the Fota today. It was cold and windy (and a little rainy), but that didn\u2019t stop us from thoroughly enjoying ourselves. The park is not overly developed and the animals are in habitats that are natural. It was far bigger than I",
          "Myself and partner went here at the end of our weekend break, Place is very nice, easy to get around and children would love it!A lot more relaxed than Dublin zoo. Worth a visit with children of all ages.",

          "I think Fota Wildlife park is fantastic; it's much better to see animals with room to roam around (obviously it's not as good as being out in the wild, but it's better than a zoo). It's a nice day out, especially on a day with good weather.",
          "Terrific outdoor family outing to Fota just outside cork city well worth seeing especially with children. The animals roam freely in the park and can be seen in large natural spaces as it should be. Great day out. Plenty of parking and fun to while away a day. Best visited in",

          "Great day out here. It was lovely being so close to the animals. The kids particularly loved the kangaroos jumping around. As it was a Friday it was a pity the train wasn't on. As we are normally used to Dublin zoo it was quite small and we were in and out in 2 hrs. But a good",

          "Visited here after a weekend in Cork and i would highly advice any families to make a visit. This was our second visit, last was about 5 years ago, and it has changed a lot of the better. Staff extremely friendly and good value for money. We definitely prefer here to Dublin Zoo.",
          "Came from Co. Armagh to visit and I was blown away. Loved the layout and how 'free' the animals seemed. Watched the cheetahs being fed and was amazed at how quick they were. Loved the different sections of the park. Definitely a must see",

          "It is a nice Wildlife Park and definitely worth visiting. It\u2019s possible to see many different species here. We visited the Park in December and on a Monday and that is why it was extremely quiet and deserted , even cafes in the Park were closed. We spent over 3 hours here and",

          "I have been visiting Fota wildlife park since I was a child and always enjoyed it immensely but in the last few few years they've made some much needed improvements. The park has vastly increased in size and they've brought in some beautiful new animals. It's reasonably priced",

          "Let me start by saying that I am not an advocate for animals being kept in captivity, but I do understand the importance of study, breeding and protection and this place gets it right, so very right. The enclosures are large, big, enormous in some cases The animals seem to be",
          "What can I say other than I was disappointed. The place is clean and the animals are clearly well cared for but apart from the train driver there wasn't a smile or a friendly word out of any of the staff. The merchandise in the shop was very poor in terms of choice. I don't know",
          "We both went here at the end of October and found it very reasonably priced and easy to find. The field beside the car park was opened as the car park was full. A great day well later out and an easy to follow route. You can get very close to the animals and we came across",

          "Had an amazing day, the grounds are stunning, and there was a big variety of animals. All staff we encountered were very friendly, all smiles. Booking and tickets were super easy. Will be back again!",
          "Love how the animals are able to roam and have more space than other zoos .. lovely",
          "Big crowds during the pandemic. No staff outside to ensure social distancing. Not a single mask in sight. Felt very unsafe with the crowds. Most enclosures were empty. Only interesting animals that could be seen were giraffes, zebras, lions \u2026",
          "Good day out for the kids.\nC\u00e1r Park should be included in the price had to go back and get cash for the barrier make it contact less payment or include in the ticket price. \nPizza was nice.",
          "Such a fun day out. Great range of animals. Free atmosphere doesn't feel like a zoo or enclosure. So many types of monkeys.",
          "Lovely spot to walk around and spend a day there",
          "It was amazing! A really lovely walk around the park. The animals seemed really relaxed and good taken care of and the enclosures were huge. Always worth a trip",
          "Fota was excellent lovely spaces to be distanced and everyone was so nice highly recommend Fota .",
          "Not a fault of Fota itself but just a lot of people not respecting social distancing made it a bit uncomfortable at times. The park itself is amazing.",
          "Always loved Fota Wildlife Park! Always a fantastic experience, whether with adults or with a family.\nCOVID-19 restrictions and precautions have taken away from some of the attractions but overall its still an amazing experience and the \u2026",
          "A nice outing...totally loved it...My little one enjoyed it and more than her we adult surely did. Its like a full day trip...kangaroos, wallabies, hares, meerkat etc roam freely...there are 3 baby cheetah who were born recently it was oen of the main attractions. totally recommended...",
          "We got to do the VIP experience in Fota Island in early September. It was honestly a brilliant experience. You get up close experience with a variety of animals but the best part, hands down, was the tour from the warden, Willie. He was \u2026",
          "Very impressed. My first time here( not my wife's first time) even  with covid restrictions  . Strongly recommended.",
          "Good day out lots to look at good social distancing I would recommend to  book in advance to get ur desired time slot",
          "An essential visit while in Cork, not quite as memorable as when I was a child but Fota is great for a family day out. They also serve really good coffee which was a surprise.",
          "Lovely place to visit. First time to see a lot of animals roaming freely. We spent about more than 2 hours in the wildlife park alone. Another few  hours walking around the gardens.",
          "Really nice and cool to see animals just wandering around",
          "We had a great experience down here, the kids really enjoyed it and me and my friend were worse than 2 big kids, it's a pity the had to close the playground but that's understandable as they do get over overcrowded, hand sanitary all over the place which was great, and we even got to see the new baby cheetahs \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude01",
          "Loved Fota Wildlife Park...we had based our break around it..Our first booking was cancelled due to storm Ellen for 24 hours. Well my god the work the staff must have done for A. To keep the animals safe and to have it cleaned up and safe \u2026",
          "Really disappointing. Animals were totally lethargic and barely visible. All the playgrounds were closed, don't get me wrong totally understand with Covid there are certain limitations but with all other playgrounds across the country \u2026",
          "The place is sooo big...really good for a family day out...kids can learn and see up close many wild animals...\nPerfect for walkers too and if don't want to walk...you can take the small train that will go around the park...\nDon't \u2026",
          "Great day out. Fantastic experience. Lovely summers day.",
          "Cute zoo in Ireland... great place to take children and grandchildren visiting this part of Ireland.",
          "Amazing place for family. All indoor activities are closed due to Covid-19, but still fun place to be with kids. The \u20ac3 parking fee is unfair though.",
          "beats dublin hands down!  it was quiet with covid restrictions but great show by the animals!",
          "Love this place. On this visit the monkeys were very shy, didn't see many of them",
          "It is made for the animals to be happy ... that's why I really like this place!! Really special place!!",
          "This has to be my favourite place to bring my daughter. We have amazing days here. So happy it's open again. Had great fun walking around all the animals today. Saw drills for the first time.",
          "A much loved adventure for our family. Pack a picnic and enjoy the amazing animals and beautiful scenery",
          "Very good day in Fota today with family members from Cavan and Cork. The escaping monkey running past us added to the adventure and excitement,  it seems like he was having a bit of an argument with the rest of the clan before leaving his enclosure.\nThe staff were very friendly and excellent with their help and advice.",
          "Wheelchair and buggy friendly. Plenty parking. Allows animals to roam and if you're lucky, get up close. Picnic tables are spaced out. Pizza, ice cream and coffee shops were open. Toilets were spotless.",
          "Great day out. One way system works really well.",
          "Brilliant family day out. Kids loved it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc97",

          "Cool park, large, beautiful, the working staff is friendly, there is a shop, several cafes you can have a bite to eat, there are  many bathrooms for the disabled throughout the park, there are baby changing rooms. Everything is very \u2026",
          "Really well laid out. Nice and open for kids to run around. It was such a treat to have some animals roaming free.",

          "Beautiful Zoo. Trails well maintained and happy animals.",
          "Loved every bit of it.\nAnimals so well cared for.\nSocial distance great.\nGreat family day out.\nThe sun came out too.",
          "Cant recommend it enough! Far better than Dublin zoo and far less crowded which makes all the difference",
          "Fabulous place for families,  wildlife park, extensive gardens,  great for picnics and walking,  beautiful  house and  lovely coffee shop.",
          "Fota is a magical experience for children and adults alike. Plenty of animals on show and plenty of space for most of the animals compared to Dublin Zoo. Lovely day out for families or couples. Only concern is the White Tailed Sea Eagle is \u2026",
          "Fantastic place, great day with wild animals.",
          "1st time going and have to say it\u2019s was Brilliant well worth the money and 100 times better than the zoo",
          "Love this place. Only thing is the 3e charge for the car park even though the entrance fee is quite expensive. But lovely day out and lovely staff working there.",
          "Really enjoyable, glad we got there early, little dissapointed the playground and train weren't available, hopefully next time we go they'll be back up and running",
          "Great day out for all the family. Really great to see the continued investment in new facilities  for attendees and animals. Highly recommended.",
          "Recent visit here with my son was amazing the delight on his face was enough to make me feel great. Will certainly come again to see the wonderful park soon",
          "It was very enjoyable, its the first time we have done something since the whole covid 19 started and there was plenty of hand sanitizer around, you felt safe and comfortable. Some people didn't really pay much attention to the distance \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed my trip to Fota park, it's a great facility to have in Ireland and much better than traditional zoos. However, some of the animals were in smaller enclosures than I expected. Some of the tigers were in small enclosures and \u2026",
          "Absolutely brilliant, the animals looked happy and healthy with loads of space to move around. Best wildlife park we have ever been to!",
          "Having been there as a kid before I was expecting something different. The day we went it seemed as those the animals were on lock down too. People wandering seeking some life in the park. Highlight was feeding the ducks due to lack of \u2026",
          "Lovely to see all the animals, kept very tidy, and handing the social distancing very well with the one way system.",
          "Had a great time. Great place for children lots of space well worth a day out. \ud83d\udc4dto the staff good",
          "Fota - just back after a 3 hr tour - I have to say the place looks amazing, its been years since I was last there, the staff are doing a fantastic job. I fell in love. The facilities were spotless clean. I had to give credit where credit is due 10 stars if I could. Thanks all for an enjoyable morning.",
          "Booked in the morning for the afternoon and good covid social distancing measures in place.",
          "Fantastic zoo, love how upclose you can get to the animals. The jewel of Cork",
          "It's a great place for children to explore & see the animals up close.  It takes approximately 2.5 hrs to get around it& it has plenty of picnic areas.",
          "Great day out, however you will need 3 euro in coin to exit the car park.  Did not care for the gift shop.",
          "Fota was by far the best wildlife park I've ever visited; a close-up experience you get in few other parks. Thank you so much to the absolute gent that helped jumpstart my car after; a quality park ran by top staff!",
          "Brilliant day out. Was delighted to see the animals cared for so well...credit to the staff. Adults and children could enjoy equally. The lions quarters were impressive.",
          "Amazing day out with family",
          "One of the few zoos in the world that I've been to where you really feel that conservation is really what this zoo is about.  Lots of space for the animals to roam about. A must see for the kids",
          "Fantastic place to go with family and friends.",
          "Very big but not a lot of animals",
          "Good one way system in place and booked time slots to manage numbers, took a while to queue to see the lions but no other queues, plenty of animals to see and a nice walk around",
          "Great fun in the zoo! Even after Storm Ellen and partial flooding, the whole place was open bar a few pathways. Would recommend for any and all ages!",
          "Fantastic as always! Lots more to see compared to last time I went. Staff brilliant kind and helpful as always. A staff member went above and beyond today to help a child with autism. Will always recommend Fota!",
          "This was a great place to bring the kids very well organised with social distance in mind one way system all the way around and we didnt miss anything well done to all involved one negative the gift shop should have more markings out side \u2026",
          "3 stars because while we had to book tickets on line due restrictions, the day we went the crowds were similar to pre covid visits and there were groups of people just gathering at each animal enclosure, except for the tiger observation platform where the girl in charge kept people moving.",
          "Great day out definitely recommended \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great selection of animals and keeps more than happy to answer questions and chat. Well worth the money.",
          "Fits wildlife park is a weekend destination for kids and family. This place is near to cork city. The ticket for an adult along with  car parking is around 20 Euro. This is a perfect place when the weather is sunny and looking for a walk. \u2026",
          "Absolutely fantastic place for the family. Highly recommend this place.",
          "We had wonderful family day out. The team were very welcoming and helpful and facilities were very clean. The visitors we met were very compliant with distancing etc. Maybe sanitizers could b checked more regularly. Thoroughly enjoyable day. Well done to the entire team at Fota.",
          "Fota is fantastic fun for the whole family, I couldn't recommend it enough. Everytime we go they have improved things again and the staff are excellent. Make sure to bring a 50c coin to feed the ducks and change for the car park (3 euro)!",
          "Really fun day trip and I loved being able to see exoctic animals in a humane way",
          "Great time here. 3 hrs going around. Few places were shut for good reason.",
          "Love wildlife park, well adapted for social distancing, happy and well looked after animals.",
          "Great place to visit with the kids on a dry day load's of animals and a beautiful walk. Plenty areas to sit if you bring a picnic but also lot's of fast food and ice cream available.",
          "A great day out. My daughter loved it. Animals are well looked after and cared for. Will return in the future",
          "A wonderful family day out.. Kids loved it. They need all the support they can get with the pandemic and are doing a great job",
          "Great day out. Well worth a visit",
          "One way system around park",
          "Having a yearly pass means we visit a few times a month, kids love it. Very clean and plenty of picnic tables scattered around the park. Only 3 areas have toilets, would like to see more as there is a bit of a distance between them, especially if you have kids.",
          "Excellent day out at Fota Wildlife Park today. Good social distancing, and plenty of covid compliance officers around. Even the animals seemed happy to see all the visitors",
          "Had a brilliant day at fota wildlife",
          "Disappointed in this. Long walk but very little animals, mostly giraffes. Daughter was looking for elephants but there are none. The Dublin zoo is way way better this. You also have to pay \u20ac3 for the parking and Garden has nothing special to see, you can just skip it. I will not go back and cannot recommend it.",
          "Good place to put in 3 hours or so. Lots to see. Very friendly staff.  A little bit cheeky to charge parking after the cost to get in ( which is on the high side) but you'll have a great time regardless.",
          "Good place to see wild animals",
          "Fantastic wildlife park. Great variety of animals. Beautifully maintained. Lovely staff.",
          "Well organized, clean, lovely and relaxing place",
          "It's fantastic for everyone who loves animals. It's much better than the zoo, animals have much more freedom, some of them are running free.",
          "Love it some people still don't get social distance however it was brilliant.",
          "Great place for a family trip for all age groups",
          "Lovely place very well looked after. The only improvement will be to get a couple of disabled scooters. Too long to be pushing a weelchair!!",
          "An absolutely brilliant place to visit with the family. Hopeful staff and lots to do and see. Will be back.",
          "The animals were very quiet, sleepy, I dont think their surroundings were of a great standard compared to Dublin Zoo but it was a lovely afternoon anyways.  It just needs a little investment",
          "Fantastic area. Expansive yet doable.   Free roaming kangaroos, lemurs, and birds add to the well kept modern grounds.  The enclosures resemble natural habitat and allow for great views. \n\nConveniently close to Fota house gardens.",
          "Great day. Great to see so many animals in wide open spaces. Good experience. Recommended.",
          "I love going here and seeing the animals in their spacious inclosures. There really is great love for all the animals from workers.",
          "Amazing day at Fota. Lovely facilities and a great day out for all",
          "Very nice place, perfect place to go with children. They also have benches(very useful) where you can relax and enjoy the day.",
          "Highly recommend for the families,  a lot to see",
          "The animals are accessible great view of most of them giraffes come over to the gate I think they are fed there which is clever nice places for snacks coffees and a well stocked gift shop",
          "Amazing place to go! Highly recommend!",
          "Great place to bring the kids, and big kids",
          "An amazing wildlife park that provides their animals with big enclosures. I wish that fota received more funding as I feel as it is a much more free and liberating experience for the animals compared to other zoos and I have eagerly been awaiting the bear enclosures.",
          "Loved it.. much better than dublin zoo",
          "Just left the park. Its absolutely lashing but had a great day all the same. 2ad+2ch for \u20ac50. Will 100% be back when we visit cork again.",
          "Brilliant day out, highly recommended. The one way system is working great!",
          "Great place for kids to get close and see animals property. Loved the cheetah cubs.",
          "A lovely day out, I would recommend going later in the evening if possible less crowds and the animals seem a bit more active... it would be a 5/5 only for they fact they charge for parking on top of the price.",
          "I have always wanted to visit and was not disappointed.",
          "A really great animal park to visit for old and young alike. The animals are all so well looked after and have loads of space to wander in. Be sure to buy a map so you can see where each animal is so you dont miss anything. Very well run. \u2026",
          "I have been here twice and it has been great both times. You can get very close to the animals without disturbing them. Literally a few feet from the Cheetah! Kangaroo and Wallaby roam free around the park as well which is fun to see them bouncing by. Highly recommend a visit here. Not to much of a drive from Cork city.",
          "Great Place. Reached around 12.30pm there. Lots of areas to park. If you go by a group of people you will get some discount. There is discount for people above 60 years too. Families also can have some discount. Just ask the ticket counter \u2026",
          "Great family day out. For all ages. Yearly ticket amazing value for your money",
          "Fab place and well run",
          "I will have to come back after covid. It wasn't as good as it could be. Feeding times are not posted to avoid crowds. No playing area open. Queue to see lion. It's a pity.",
          "Great place to visit and down your whole day with family. During covid19 few things were closed off, plus all childrens playgrounds locked. Regardless, there is enough animals and walking areas to have fun all day long.",
          "A great day out. We brought a picnic and really enjoyed our day.",
          "Great place to come and explore,, fantastic to see some of the animals roam free among the visitors,  and the animals are so happy and healthy looking .",
          "VISITING TIPS\n-Start your visit as early as possible\n-Bring your own food and water, suncream or weather appropriate clothing\n-Keep an eye out for the animals that roam free around the park, you may be able to snap a close-up picture\n-Avoid \u2026",
          "Great family day out",

          "The weather was lovely and the grandkids really enjoyed it",

          "Amazing place. I loved it.",
          "Great day out, even with the current covid-19 restrictions. Highly recommended.",

          "Amazing place for all ages !",
          "Really well laid out with new restrictions, fair play",
          "Love this place, the animals have so much space and look a lot more comfortable than dublin zoo. I'm a big cat fan and this is awesome for me",
          "Lovely open area,really nice friendly staff. Not a place where I'd say the animals are under any pressure. Would recommend",
          "Great, apart from the rain. Animals looked and seemed happy though",
          "Super fun; interesting animals and an informative tour. The VIP tour is well worth it!",

          "Great place for children and parents to get close to animals",
          "A great wildlife park. Easy parking, great animals to see. The kids loved the tigers and lions etc. they also loved feeding the ducks, peacocks and other birds. Feed machine only takes 50c coins which is a bother if you only have euro or 2 \u2026",
          "An amazing adventure from free roaming peacocks and wallabies to monkeys and lions this place is a little slice of the animal kingdom and a real treat, a long old walk though \ud83d\ude01",
          "Amazing time.  Pets have a lot of freedom.  Super picnic area.  A child-friendly place",
          "I\u2019ve been lucky to be able to go to Fota many times throughout my childhood years as I lived in proximity to the park.\nThe improvements and additions they\u2019ve made in the last 5 years (with more coming still!) have been fantastic, really \u2026",

          "Lovely day out for all family!",
          "Great day out for the family",
          "Always a great day out. Best zoo in the country in my opinion. Animals seem v happy and have big enclosures. Decent enough pricing with a family of 4 (2+2) for \u20ac49.50. Car park is \u20ac3 so just beware of that. (Hot choclate is really good to just to let you know!)",
          "Animals look like they're much better cared for than the likes of Dublin Zoo. All the animals have a relatively large space to roam.",

          "Great to look at the animals in a more natural habitat then a zoo",

          "Lovely park,animals have huge places to roaming around .Safe to visit even in this strange time!",
          "Very enjoyable day out. Still a lot of work being done to this park which will improve it more. Great fun for any age. The rhinos looked a bit sad though and the eagle definitely does not have enough room.",

          "It's great for the kids and the kids want to go back to there",
          "Great day out. Very well organised for Covid. One way system works well. Had to queue for the lions but was worth it. Social distancing markers are everywhere, my only gripe was that some people don't adhere to them, not Fota's fault. Would definitely recommend a visit.",

        "wiki": "Chris Bathgate (born 21 April 1982) is an American indie folk singer-songwriter and musician. He is prominent in the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti folk music scene in Michigan. In 2007, Bathgate signed to Quite Scientific Records, on which he released his most prominent album to date, A Cork Tale Wake. His most recent release was Salt Year, a full-length album released on 26 April 2011. Bathgate has been compared to folk singer-songwriters Sufjan Stevens, Iron & Wine, and Damien Jurado.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nChris Bathgate was born in Pecatonica, IL on 21 April 1982. He began playing music at the age of 16, and relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend the University of Michigan as an Art & Design student.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nBathgate started out in a heavy metal band for several years before turning to folk. While in Ann Arbor, Bathgate then formed the folk trio Ambitious Brothers with Michael Beauchamp and Karl Sturk, releasing a few records before breaking up in 2005.During a trip to Northern Michigan, Bathgate and fellow University of Michigan student Jansen Swy along with other friends set music to Swy's poetry, calling the short-lived project The Descent of the Holy Ghost Church. Later on, while attending the New England Literature Program, a University of Michigan summer program in Maine, Descent resurfaced when the group managed to book itself as an opening act for Magnolia Electric Company at Detroit's Magic Stick. The group, which included Matt Jones, Louis Dickinson, and Carol Gray, disbanded in 2006.\n\n\n=== Solo career ===\nIn 2001, Bathgate launched his solo career, while continuing to experiment with different groups for several years. He self-released multiple EPs and albums including Twilight Unlimited in 2002, Create and Consume in 2003, and Silence Is For Suckers in 2005. He would often sell his records to local Ann Arbor music store Encore Records.In 2006, Bathgate simultaneously released two albums, A Detailed Account of Three Dreams and Throatsleep, as well as an EP, The Single Road I Longed For. During the year, Real Detroit Weekly named Bathgate 'Best Solo Artist in Michigan'.In 2007, Bathgate linked up with Saturday Looks Good To Me as an opening act for their European tour.Later in 2007, Bathgate signed to Michigan record label Quite Scientific Records, on which he released A Cork Tale Wake on 26 June. He spent the remainder of the year on a national tour. The album received high praise for its \"bruised sounding beauty\" and short, simple songs that \"let his voice do the talking\". On 15 January 2008, NPR Music chose the opening track \"Serpentine\" as its Song of the Day. A Cork Tale Wake was released in the UK on Tangled Up!/One Little Indian.\nIn February 2008, Bathgate released a limited EP, Wait, Skeleton, on Quite Scientific Records.\nIn March 2008, 2009, and 2011, Bathgate played at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, TX.\nApril 2011 saw the release of his second nationally distributed full length, \"Salt Year\" on Quite Scientific Records.\n\n\n=== Musical style ===\nBathgate's music has been described as \"stripped down with liberal amounts of acoustic guitar, piano, strings, and even a little horn work here and there\", with all these instruments meant to \"complement Bathgate's voice\".\n\n\n==== Lyrics and songwriting ====\nBathgate often references hometown Ann Arbor, Michigan sites in his songs. He references a local Ann Arbor street, Ann St., in \"The Last Parade On Ann St.\".  Bathgate lived at 609 Ann St. \"Madison House\" refers to the former backyard music venue Madison House in Ann Arbor.\n\n\n=== Style of live shows ===\nBathgate is known for a using a wide range of techniques, instruments, and supporting musicians during live shows.\nEarly in his career, he would play Hayden Carruth poems, read by him, through the amp, as he intertwined his music. He has used loop pedals to layer his instruments and vocals during shows, an e-bow on his electric guitar to mimic the sound of bows on strings, and a mountain dulcimer.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nBathgate has cited influences including American novelists John Steinbeck and Kurt Vonnegut, poets Suzanne Hancock (Another Name For Bridge) and Josh Bell (No Planets Strike), and musicians They Were Thieves, Matt Jones, and Hezekiah Jones.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nDead Eyed Stranger (2001)\nCreate and Consume (2003)\nTime Heals All Wounds (2004)\nSilence Is For Suckers (2005)\nThe Single Road I Longed For (2006)\nA Detailed Account of Three Dreams (2006)\nThroatsleep (2006)\nA Cork Tale Wake (2007)\nA Cork Tale Wake (2008) UK\nSalt Year (2011)\nDizzy Seas (2017)\n\n\n=== EPs and singles ===\nTwilight Unlimited (2002)\nA Detailed Account of Three Dreams (2006)\nAuld Lang Syne (2007)\nSerpentine (2008) UK\nRestless (2008) UK\nWait, Skeleton.

          "A fantastic building and setting amongst the university college grounds. However unfortunatley the exhibition that we were looking forward to seeing (2116) was just a little too abstract for our tastes and sparse on the ground. For this reason it was a little dissappointing.",
          "My Family and I visited the Lewis Glucksman Gallery recently. It was very interesting and unusual . There is a nice Cafe on the ground floor. The building is nice and unique. It was a nice dry day so we walked around the grounds and it was well worth the visit.",
          "I really like this gallery, if been there several times and have seen different exhibitions and I was always impressed. One of the only galleries in town. The admission is free but a donation of 5 \u20ac is suggested. The donation is adequate in my eyes. There is as well a caf\u00e9 at",

          "We've visited this gallery several times over the years, usually for family Sunday. This is an art 'class' for the whole family where materials and inspiration is supplied. My kids are seven and two and both love these classes. A donation of just \u20ac5 is recommended, which is",
          "A little walk away from the city centre, this gallery is worth the trip. With its intriguing architecture, this gallery often showcases contemporary artworks and interesting exhibitions. The gallery is light and bright, and visitors meander upwards through the gallery. Every now",

        "wiki": "St Patrick's Street (Irish: Sr\u00e1id Naomh P\u00e1draig) is the main shopping street of the city of Cork in the south of Ireland. Since its redevelopment in 2004, it has twice won the award of Ireland's best shopping street. St Patrick's Street is colloquially known to some locals as \"Pana\".\n\n\n== Location ==\nSt Patrick's Street runs in a curve from Saint Patrick's Bridge to Daunt Square, where it meets Grand Parade. The street obtains its curved shape due to its location over an arm of the River Lee.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe street dates from the late 18th Century as the city expanded beyond the walls of the ancient city which was centered on North & South Main Street. During the 1780s, many of the streets that now form the city centre of Cork were formed by the spanning of the river channels between the islands of the Lee.\nParts of Patrick Street were extensively damaged during the Irish War of Independence in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\" in 1920. This included the Munster Arcade and Grant's department store.\nFrom 1898 to 1931, the street was served by the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company. Services started on 22 December 1898, however it closed on 30 September 1931 due to increasing popularity of bus services operated by The Irish Omnibus Company and the takeover of the company's electricity plant by the Electricity Supply Board.\nIn 2004, the street was redeveloped by architect Beth Gali in order to make the street more friendly to pedestrians. This included repaving of the street and widening of pedestrian pavements in order to create plazas.Between March and April 2018, Cork City Council banned afternoon traffic on Patrick Street, with only public transport traffic allowed between 3:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. This was lifted within a few weeks due to a reported impact on city centre traders.\n\n\n== Businesses and landmarks ==\n\nThe street is home to a number of retail and department stores, including Brown Thomas, Dunnes Stores, Marks & Spencer and Penneys, at the northern end of the street. The Roches Stores building, built at the northern end of the street in the mid 1920s, housed the Roches Stores department store from the early 20th century until leased by Debenhams Ireland, who operated it from 2006 until 2020. The opposite (southwestern) end of the street includes smaller units, with jewellery stores such as Pandora, video game stores like GameStop, and health store Holland & Barrett. \nIn the early 21st century, the street saw various modernisation and rejuvenation projects. These included the opening of Opera Lane in 2010, the redesigning of shop facades in 2016, and the development of the former Capitol Cinema site in 2017.A monument to Fr. Theobald Mathew, the Apostle of Temperance, stands at the northern end of the street facing St. Patrick's Bridge over the River Lee. The monument dates back to October 1864.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Cork (; Irish: Corcaigh, pronounced [\u02c8ko\u027ek\u026a\u025f], from corcach, meaning \"marsh\") is the second largest city in Ireland, located in the south-west of Ireland, in the province of Munster. Following an extension to the city's boundary in 2019, its population is c. 210,000.The city centre is an island positioned between two channels of the River Lee which meet downstream at the eastern end of the city centre, where the quays and docks along the river lead outwards towards Lough Mahon and Cork Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world.Originally a monastic settlement, Cork was expanded by Viking invaders around 915. Its charter was granted by Prince John in 1185. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can be found around South and North Main streets. The third largest city by population on the island of Ireland, the city's cognomen of \"the rebel city\" originates in its support for the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the Roses. Corkonians sometimes refer to the city as \"the real capital\", a reference to its opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the Irish Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Cork became (more) urbanised some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.\n\nThe city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted \"Black Rent\" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork. Together, these baronies are located between the Barony of Barrymore to the east, Muskerry East to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.\n\nThe city's municipal government was dominated by about 12\u201315 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe \u2013 in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.\nThe medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.\nThe title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent mayor by Queen Victoria on her visit to the city.Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly Irish nationalist city, with widespread support for Irish Home Rule and the Irish Parliamentary Party, but from 1910 stood firmly behind William O'Brien's dissident All-for-Ireland Party. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the Cork Free Press. Cork was overtaken by Belfast as Ireland's second largest city in the nineteenth-century.\nIn the War of Independence, the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British Black and Tans, in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\" and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the Irish Civil War, Cork was for a time held by anti-Treaty forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty National Army in an attack from the sea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Cork, like the vast majority of Ireland, is mild oceanic (Cfb in the Koeppen climate classification) and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b. Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city centre. The airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the rest of the city. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill. Due to its position on the coast, Cork city is subject to occasional flooding.Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) or above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) are rare. Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres (48.34 in) of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 \"rainy\" days a year (over 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with \"heavy rain\" (over 5 millimetres (0.20 in)). Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no \"recordable sunshine\", mostly during and around winter.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design provide a throughput of new blood, as do the active theatre components of several courses at University College Cork (UCC). Important elements in the cultural life of the city are: Corcadorca Theatre Company, of which Cillian Murphy was a troupe member prior to Hollywood fame; the Institute for Choreography and Dance, a national contemporary dance resource; the Triskel Arts Centre (capacity c.90), which includes the Triskel Christchurch independent cinema; dance venue the Firkin Crane (capacity c.240); the Cork Academy of Dramatic Art (CADA) and Graffiti Theatre Company; and the Cork Jazz Festival, Cork Film Festival and Live at the Marquee events. The Everyman Palace Theatre (capacity c.650) and the Granary Theatre (capacity c.150) both host plays throughout the year.\nCork is home to the RT\u00c9 Vanbrugh Quartet, and popular rock musicians and bands including John Spillane, Rory Gallagher, Five Go Down to the Sea?, Microdisney, The Frank and Walters, Sultans of Ping, Simple Kid, Fred and Mick Flannery. The opera singers Cara O'Sullivan, Mary Hegarty, Brendan Collins, and Sam McElroy are also Cork born.\nRanging in capacity from 50 to 1,000, the main music venues in the city are the Cork Opera House (capacity c.1000), The Everyman, Cyprus Avenue, Dali, Triskel Christchurch, The Roundy, and Coughlan's.\n\nThe city's literary community centres on the Munster Literature Centre and the Triskel Arts Centre. The short story writers Frank O'Connor and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in hailed from Cork, and contemporary writers include Thomas McCarthy, Gerry Murphy, and novelist and poet William Wall.\nAdditions to the arts infrastructure include modern additions to the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery and renovations to the Cork Opera House in the early 21st century. The Lewis Glucksman Gallery opened in the Autumn of 2004 at UCC, was nominated for the Stirling Prize in the United Kingdom, and the building of a new \u20ac60 million School of Music was completed in September 2007.\nCork was the European Capital of Culture for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the Lonely Planet's top 10 \"Best in Travel 2010\". The guide described Cork as being \"at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse\".There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between Manchester and London, Melbourne and Sydney or Barcelona and Madrid. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves as \"The Rebels\"; the county is known as the Rebel County. This view sometimes manifests itself in humorous references to the Real Capital and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating The People's Republic of Cork.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nThe city has many local traditions in food, including crubeens, tripe and drisheen, which were historically served in eating houses like that run by Katty Barry in the mid-20th century. The English Market sells locally produced foods, including fresh fish, meats, fruit and vegetables, eggs and artisan cheeses and breads. During certain city festivals, food stalls are also sometimes erected on city streets such as St. Patrick's Street or Grand Parade.\n\n\n=== Accent ===\nThe Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of Hiberno-English, displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard Hiberno-English, some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad. The Cork accent displays varying degrees of rhoticity, usually indicative of the speaker's local community.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\n\nBroadcasting companies based in Cork include RT\u00c9 Cork, which has a radio, television and production unit on Father Matthew Street in the city centre. Communicorp Media opened a radio studio in 2019 in the city covering content on both Today FM and Newstalk. Virgin Media Television also has an office in the city which covers local news stories developing within the city and county.The city's FM radio band features RT\u00c9 Radio 1, RT\u00c9 2fm, RT\u00c9 lyric fm, RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta, Today FM, Classic Hits, Newstalk and the religious station Spirit Radio. There are also local stations such as Cork's 96FM, Cork's Red FM, C103, CUH 102.0FM, UCC 98.3FM (formerly Cork Campus Radio 97.4fm) and Christian radio station Life 93.1FM. Cork also has a temporary licensed citywide community station 'Cork FM Community Radio' on 100.5FM, which is on-air on Saturdays and Sundays only. Cork has also been home to pirate radio stations, including South Coast Radio and ERI in the 1980s. Today some small pirates stations remain.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCork is home to one of Ireland's main national newspapers, the Irish Examiner (formerly the Cork Examiner). Its 'sister paper', The Echo (formerly the Evening Echo), was for decades connected to the \"Echo boys\", who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in parts of the city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent. The city's university publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nCork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods. The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the Red Abbey. There are two cathedrals in the city; St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the Catholic cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Church of Ireland (Anglican) and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect William Burges.\nSt. Patrick's Street, the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. At its northern end is a landmark statue of Father Mathew. The reason for its curved shape is that it was originally a channel of the River Lee which was built over on arches. The General Post Office, with its limestone fa\u00e7ade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal  which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.\nThe Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions. The old financial centre is the South Mall, with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century, such as the Allied Irish Bank's which was once an exchange.\n\nMany of the city's buildings are in the Georgian style, although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures, such as County Hall tower, which was, at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building: The Elysian. Outside the County Hall is the landmark sculpture of two men, known locally as 'Cha and Miah'. Across the river from County Hall is Ireland's longest building; built in Victorian times, Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital has now been partially renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall, after its architect William Atkins.Cork's most famous building is the church tower of Shandon, which dominates the North side of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon. Another site in Shandon is Skiddy's Almshouse, which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to the poorest of the city.\nCork City Hall, another notable building of limestone, replaced the previous one which was destroyed by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\". The cost of this new building was provided by the UK Government in the 1930s as a gesture of reconciliation.\n\nOther notable places include Elizabeth Fort, the Cork Opera House, Christ Church on South Main Street (now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church), and St Mary's Dominican Church on Popes Quay. Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of University College Cork, through which the River Lee flows, the Women's Gaol at Sunday's Well (now a heritage centre) and the English Market. This covered market traces its origins back to 1610, and the present building dates from 1786.Parks and amenity spaces include Fitzgerald's Park to the west of the city (which contains the Cork Public Museum), the angling lake known as The Lough, Bishop Lucey Park (which is centrally located and contains a portion of the old city wall) and the Marina and Atlantic Pond (an avenue and amenity near Blackrock used by joggers, runners and rowing clubs).Up until April 2009, there were also two large commercial breweries in the city. The Beamish and Crawford on South Main Street closed in April 2009 and transferred production to the Murphy's brewery in Lady's Well. This brewery also produces Heineken for the Irish market. There is also the Franciscan Well brewery, which started as an independent brewery in 1998 but has since been acquired by Coors.\n\n\n== Local government and politics ==\n\nWith a population of approximately 210,000, Cork is the second-most populous city in the State and the 16th-most populous area of local government. Per the Local Government Act 2001, Cork City Council is a tier-1 entity of local government with the same status in law as a county council.\nWhile local government in Ireland has limited powers in comparison with other countries, the council has responsibility for planning, roads, sanitation, libraries, street lighting, parks, and a number of other important functions. Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral areas. As of the 2019 Cork City Council election, the council's members are affiliated to the following political parties: Fianna F\u00e1il (8 members), Fine Gael (7 members), Green Party (4 members), Sinn F\u00e9in (4 members), Labour (1 member), Solidarity\u2013People Before Profit (1 member), Workers' Party (1 member), Independents (5 members). Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the South-West Regional Authority. A new Lord Mayor of Cork is chosen in a vote by the elected members of the council under a D'Hondt system count. Since June 2020, the mayor has been Joe Kavanagh of Fine Gael.Cork City Hall is located along Albert Quay on the south side of the city. It officially opened on 8 September 1936, following the previous building being destroyed in the \"Burning of Cork\" in 1920. The administrative offices for Cork County Council are also located within the city limits, on the Carrigrohane Road on the west side of the city.For the purposes of elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the city is part of two constituencies: Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central which each returns four TDs. Following the 2016 general election, these constituencies together returned two TDs for the Fine Gael party, three for Fianna F\u00e1il, two for Sinn F\u00e9in and one for the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit.\nIn 2018, cabinet approval was given for an extension of the Cork City Council boundary, to include Cork Airport, Douglas, Ballincollig and other surrounding areas. This extension was completed in mid-2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nThe retail trade in Cork city includes a mix of modern shopping centres and family owned local shops. Shopping centres can be found in several of Cork's suburbs, including Blackpool, Ballincollig, Douglas, Ballyvolane, Wilton and at Mahon Point Shopping Centre.\n\nOther shopping arcades are in the city centre, including the \"Cornmarket Centre\" on Cornmarket Street, \"Merchant's Quay Shopping Centre\" on Merchant's Quay, home to Debenhams, Dunnes Stores and Marks & Spencer, and a retail street called Opera Lane off St. Patrick's Street/Academy Street. A mixed retail and office development, on the site of the former Capitol Cineplex, with approximately 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) of retail space, was opened in June 2017. Retail tenants in this development include Facebook, AlienVault and Huawei.Cork's main shopping street is St. Patrick's Street and is the most expensive street in the country per sq. metre after Dublin's Grafton Street. The area was impacted by the post-2008 downturn, though retail growth has increased since, with Penneys announcing expansion plans in 2015, redesigning of some facades on the street, and opening of newer outlets, including Superdry in 2015. Other shopping areas in the city centre include Oliver Plunkett St. and Grand Parade. Cork is home to some of the country's leading department stores with the foundations of shops such as Dunnes Stores and the former Roches Stores being laid in the city.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nCork City is a hub of industry in the region. Several pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in the area, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Swiss company Novartis. Perhaps the most famous product of the Cork pharmaceutical industry is Viagra. Cork is also the European headquarters of Apple Inc. where over 3,000 staff are involved in manufacturing, R&D and customer support. Logitech and EMC Corporation are also important IT employers in the area. Three hospitals are also among the top ten employers in the city.The city is also home to the Heineken Brewery that brews Murphy's Irish Stout and the nearby Beamish and Crawford brewery (taken over by Heineken in 2008) which have been in the city for generations. 45% of the world's Tic Tac sweets are manufactured at the city's Ferrero factory. For many years, Cork was the home to Ford Motor Company, which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984. Henry Ford's grandfather was from West Cork, which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in Cork. Technology has since replaced the older manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s, with people now working at a number of IT companies across the city area \u2013 such as Amazon.com, the online retailer, which has offices at Cork Airport Business Park.Cork's deep harbour allows large ships to enter, bringing trade and easy import/export of products. Cork Airport also allows easy access to continental Europe and Cork Kent railway station in the city centre provides good rail links for domestic trade.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nAccording to the 2011 Cork City Employment & Land Use Survey, the single largest employers in the city (all with over 1,000 employees) include Cork University Hospital, Apple Inc, University College Cork, Boston Scientific, Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology, Bon Secours Hospital, Cork, retailers Supervalu and Centra, the Irish Defence Forces at Collins Barracks, and the Mercy University Hospital.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCork Airport is the second busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and is situated on the south side of Cork city close to Ballygarvan. Nine airlines fly to more than 45 destinations in Europe. Scheduled airlines using Cork airport include Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air, Air France, Flybe, Iberia Express, Ryanair, Swiss International Air Lines and Volotea.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nPublic bus services within the city are provided by the national bus operator Bus \u00c9ireann. City routes are numbered from 201 through to 226 and connect the city centre to the principal suburbs, colleges, shopping centres and places of interest. Two of these bus routes provide orbital services across the Northern and Southern districts of the city respectively. Buses to the outer suburbs and towns, such as Ballincollig, Glanmire, Midleton and Carrigaline are provided from the city's bus terminal at Parnell Place in the city centre. Suburban services also include shuttles to Cork Airport, and a park and ride facility in the south suburbs only.\nLong-distance buses depart from the bus terminal in Parnell Place to destinations throughout Ireland. Hourly services run to Killarney/Tralee, Waterford, Athlone and Shannon Airport/Limerick/Galway and there are six services daily to Dublin. There is also a daily Eurolines bus service that connects Cork to Victoria Coach Station in London via South Wales and Bristol.\nPrivate operators include Irish Citylink, Aircoach and Dublin Coach. Irish Citylink serves Limerick and Galway. Aircoach operates an Express non-stop service which serves Dublin City Centre and Dublin Airport 18 times daily in each direction. Dublin Coach serves Dublin via Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cashel and Cahir.\n\n\n=== Harbour and waterways ===\n\nThe Cross River Ferry, from Rushbrooke to Passage West, links the R624 to R610. This service is used by some commuters to avoid traffic in the Jack Lynch Tunnel and Dunkettle area. The Port of Cork is situated at Ringaskiddy, 16 kilometres (10 miles) SE via the N28. Brittany Ferries operates direct car ferry services from Cork to Roscoff in France.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThe city's road infrastructure improved in the late 20th and early 21st century, including from the early 1980s construction of the Cork South Link dual carriageway which links the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly after, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued on extending the N25 South Ring Road through the 1990s, culminating in the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project \u2013 which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The M8 motorway links Cork with Dublin.\nFrom 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas. Subsequently, in 2014, a public bicycle rental scheme was launched. The scheme is operated by An Rothar Nua on behalf of the National Transport Authority, with funding supplemented by an advertising sponsor. The scheme supports 330 bikes with 31 stations placed around the city for paid public use.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Railway and tramway heritage ====\nCork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from Dublin Heuston. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at Blackpool, the route now reaches the city centre terminus of Kent Station via the Glanmire tunnel and Kilnap Viaduct. Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns of Cobh and Midleton east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of Youghal, until the 1980s.\n\nOther rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway, a line to Macroom, the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway to Blarney, Coachford and Donoughmore, as well as the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway connecting Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and many other West Cork towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement).\nWithin the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American George Francis Train in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line.In December 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company began operating on the Blackpool\u2013Douglas, Summerhill\u2013Sunday's Well and Tivoli\u2013Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.\nThe wider city area, including the city's suburbs, is served by three railway stations. These are Cork Kent railway station, Little Island railway station and Glounthaune railway station.\n\n\n==== Current routes ====\nCork's Kent Station is the main railway station in the city. From here, Irish Rail services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to Dublin has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork, and is linked from Limerick Junction with connections to Clonmel and Waterford. InterCity services are also available to Killarney and Tralee, and to Limerick, Ennis, Athenry and Galway (via Limerick Junction and the Limerick to Galway railway line).The Cork Suburban Rail system also departs from Kent Station and provides connections to parts of Metropolitan Cork. Stations include Little Island, Mallow, Midleton, Fota and Cobh. In July 2009 the Glounthaune to Midleton line was reopened, with new stations at Carrigtwohill and Midleton (and additional stations proposed for Blarney and elsewhere). Little Island railway station serves Cork's Eastern Suburbs.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCork is an important educational centre in Ireland \u2013 There are over 35,000 third level students in the city, meaning the city has a higher ratio of students in the population than the national average. Over 10% of the population of the Metropolitan area are students in University College Cork (UCC) and Cork Institute of Technology (CIT), including nearly 3,000 international students from over 100 different countries. UCC is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and offers courses in arts, commerce, engineering, law, medicine and science. It  has been named \"Irish University of the Year\" four times since 2003, most recently in 2016. Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) was named Irish \"Institute of Technology of the Year\" in 2007, 2010 and 2016 and offers third level courses in Computing and IT, Business, Humanities and Engineering (Mechanical, Electronic, Electrical, and Chemical).\nThe National Maritime College of Ireland is located in Cork and is the only Irish college in which Nautical Studies and Marine Engineering can be undertaken. CIT incorporates the Cork School of Music and Crawford College of Art and Design as constituent schools. The Cork College of Commerce is the largest 'College of Further Education' in Ireland. Other 3rd level institutions include Griffith College Cork, a private institution, and various other colleges.\nResearch institutes linked to the third level colleges in the city support the research and innovation capacity of the city and region. Examples include the Tyndall National Institute (ICT hardware research), IMERC (Marine Energy), Environmental Research Institute, NIMBUS (Network Embedded Systems); and CREATE (Advanced Therapeutic Engineering). UCC and CIT also have start-up company incubation centres. In UCC, the IGNITE Graduate Business Innovation Centre aims to foster and support entrepreneurship. In CIT, The Rubicon Centre is a business innovation hub that is home to 57 knowledge based start-up companies.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nRugby, Gaelic football, hurling and association football are popular sporting pastimes for Corkonians.\n\n\n=== Gaelic games ===\n\nHurling and football are the most popular spectator sports in the city. Hurling has a strong identity with city and county \u2013 with Cork winning 30 All-Ireland Championships. Gaelic football is also popular, and Cork has won 7 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles. Cork is the only county that has won both championships at least 7 times and the only that has won both in the 21st century. There are many Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Cork City, including Blackrock National Hurling Club, St. Finbarr's, Glen Rovers, Na Piarsaigh, Nemo Rangers and Douglas GAA. The main public venues are P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh and P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Rinn (named after the noted Glen Rovers player Christy Ring). Camogie (hurling for ladies) and women's Gaelic football are increasing in popularity.\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nCork City F.C. are the largest and most successful association football team in Cork, winning three League of Ireland titles, four FAI Cup titles, and one \"All Ireland\" Setanta Sports Cup title. They play their home games on the south side of the city in Turners Cross. Several, now defunct, Cork clubs played in the League of Ireland before 1984. In total, teams from the city have won the league 12 times. Association football is also played by amateur and school clubs across the city, as well as in \"five-a-side\" style leagues.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\nRugby union is played at various levels, from school to senior league level. There are two first division clubs in Cork city. Cork Constitution (five-time All Ireland League Champions) play their home games in Ballintemple and Dolphin R.F.C. play at home in Musgrave Park. Other notable rugby clubs in the city include, Highfield, Sunday's Well and UCC. At schools level, Christian Brothers College and Presentation Brothers College are two of the country's better known rugby nurseries.\nMunster Rugby plays a number of its home matches in the Pro14 at Musgrave Park in Ballyphehane. In the past Heineken Cup matches have also been played at Musgrave Park, but most of these are now played at Thomond Park in Limerick. In May 2006 and again in May 2008 Munster became the Heineken Cup champions, with many players hailing from Cork city and county.\n\n\n=== Water sports ===\nThere are a variety of watersports in Cork, including rowing and sailing. There are five rowing clubs training on the river Lee, including Shandon BC, UCC RC, Pres RC, Lee RC, and Cork BC. Naomh\u00f3ga Chorca\u00ed is a rowing club whose members row traditional naomh\u00f3ga on the Lee in occasional competitions. The \"Ocean to City\" race has been held annually since 2005, and attracts teams and boats from local and visiting clubs who row the 24 kilometres (15 mi) from Crosshaven into Cork city centre. The National Rowing Center was moved to Inniscarra \u2013 approximately 12 km outside the city centre \u2013 in 2007. Cork's maritime sailing heritage is maintained through its sailing clubs. The Royal Cork Yacht Club located in Crosshaven (outside the city) is the world's oldest yacht club, and \"Cork Week\" is a notable sailing event.\n\n\n=== Cricket ===\n\nThe most notable cricket club in Cork is Cork County Cricket Club, which was formed in 1874. Although located within the Munster jurisdiction, the club plays in the Leinster Senior League. The club plays at the Mardyke, a ground which has hosted three first-class matches in 1947, 1961 and 1973. All three involved Ireland playing Scotland. The Cork Cricket Academy operates within the city, with the stated aim of introducing the sport to schools in the city and county. Cork's other main cricket club, Harlequins Cricket Club, play close to Cork Airport. The provincial representative side, the Munster Reds, plays its home matches in the Twenty20 Inter-Provincial Trophy at the Mardyke Cricket Ground.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe city contains clubs active in national competitions in basketball (Neptune and UCC Demons) and American Football (Cork Admirals). There are also golf, pitch and putt, hockey, tennis, and athletics clubs in the Cork area.\nThe city is the home of road bowling, which is played in the north-side and south-west suburbs. There are boxing and martial arts clubs (including Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Karate, Muay Thai and Taekwondo) within the city, while the sports-based performance art of professional wrestling maintains a presence via local promotion Phoenix Wrestling. Cork Racing, a motorsport team based in Cork, has raced in the Irish Formula Ford Championship since 2005. Cork also hosts one of Ireland's most successful Australian Rules Football teams, the Leeside Lions, who have won the Australian Rules Football League of Ireland Premiership several times.\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\n\nCork is twinned with Cologne, Coventry, Rennes, San Francisco, Swansea and Shanghai. As of February 2017, the city council was also in talks to twin with Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg and Miami.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Cork City and its suburbs was recorded as 208,669 by the 2016 census, with in excess of 300,000 in the Metropolitan Cork area.\nThere were 119,230 people present in the Cork City Council administered area at the time of the 2011 census, of these 117,221 indicated that they were usually present in Cork. In common with other Irish urban centres, the female population (50.67%) is higher than the male population (49.33%), although the gap is somewhat smaller than in other cities.\n\nIn the 2011 census, of those usually resident, 100,901 (86.08%) were Irish citizens; 10,295 (8.78%) were citizens of other EU countries; 4,316 (3.68%) were citizens of countries elsewhere in the world; 1,709 (1.46%) did not state their citizenship.

Later immigrant communities retain their places of worship. In the 2011 and 2016 censuses, Roman Catholicism was the most common religion in the city overall, followed by Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, and Islam. As of the 2016 census, an increasing number of residents (15%) indicated that they had no religion \u2013 a higher rate of increase and a higher overall percentage than the national average (10%).\n\n\n=== City boundary expansion ===\n\nLegislation to expand the boundary of the city, which would increase its area to 187 km2 (72 sq mi) and the population within its bounds from 125,000 to 210,000, was debated and approved in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in June 2018. Corresponding legislation was drafted during July 2018, and signed into law, as part of the Local Government Act 2018, by President Michael D. Higgins in January 2019. The boundary change occurred at the end of May 2019, following the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMerchants, Mystics and Philanthropists \u2013 350 Years of Cork Quakers Richard S.

        "wiki": "The Blarney Stone (Irish: Cloch na Blarnan) is a block of Carboniferous limestone built into the battlements of Blarney Castle, Blarney, about 8 kilometres (5 miles) from Cork, Ireland. According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with the gift of the gab (great eloquence or skill at flattery). The stone was set into a tower of the castle in 1446. The castle is a popular tourist site in Ireland, attracting visitors from all over the world to kiss the stone and tour the castle and its gardens.\nThe word blarney has come to mean \"clever, flattering, or coaxing talk\". Irish politician John O'Connor Power defined it this way: \"Blarney is something more than mere flattery. It is flattery sweetened by humour and flavoured by wit. Those who mix with Irish folk have many examples of it in their everyday experience.\" Letitia Elizabeth Landon described its contemporary meaning in an article entitled 'Blarney Castle' in 1832.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nA number of stories attempt to explain the origin of the stone and surrounding legend. An early story involves the goddess Cl\u00edodhna. Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, the builder of Blarney Castle, being involved in a lawsuit in the 15th century, appealed to Cl\u00edodhna for her assistance. She told McCarthy to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart \"the ability to deceive without offending\". MacCarthy then incorporated it into the parapet of the castle.The proprietors of Blarney Castle list several other explanations of the origins of the stone on their website. Many of these suppose that the stone had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314. The stories listed include one suggesting that the stone was presented to Cormac McCarthy by Robert the Bruce in 1314 in recognition of his support in the Battle of Bannockburn. This legend holds that this was a piece of the Stone of Scone and was installed at McCarthy's castle of Blarney. Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that the stone was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn. Moreover, analysis by geologists at the University of Glasgow in 2014 found the stone's geochemical signature matches local limestone.\n\n\n== Ritual ==\n\nThe ritual of kissing the Blarney Stone, according to the castle's proprietors, has been performed by \"millions of people\", including \"world statesmen, literary giants [and] legends of the silver screen\". The kiss, however, is not casually achieved. To touch the stone with one's lips, the participant must ascend to the castle's peak, then lean over backwards on the parapet's edge. This is traditionally achieved with the help of an assistant. Although the parapet is now fitted with wrought-iron guide rails and protective crossbars, the ritual can still trigger attacks of acrophobia.\n\nBefore the safeguards were installed, the kiss was performed with real risk to life and limb, as participants were grasped by the ankles and dangled bodily from the height. In the Sherlock Holmes radio dramatisation \"The Adventure of the Blarney Stone\" (first broadcast on 18 March 1946), a man attempting to kiss the Blarney Stone falls to his death. Holmes' investigation reveals this as a murder, the man's boots having been surreptitiously greased before the attempt.\nWilliam Henry Hurlbert wrote in 1888 that the legend of the stone seemed to be less than a hundred years old at that time, suggesting the tradition began late in the 18th century. The legend of the Blarney Stone was described in A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue by Francis Grose, printed 1785.\n\n\n== Legend ==\n\nIt is claimed that the synonymy of \"blarney\" with \"empty flattery\" or \"beguiling talk\" derives from one of two sources. One story involves the goddess Cl\u00edodhna and Cormac Laidir MacCarthy (see \"Origins\" above). Another legend suggests that Queen Elizabeth I requested Cormac Teige McCarthy, the Lord of Blarney, be deprived of his traditional land rights. Cormac travelled to see the queen, but was certain he would not persuade her to change her mind as he wasn't an effective speaker. He met an old woman on the way who told him that anyone who kissed a particular stone in Blarney Castle would be given the gift of eloquent speech. Cormac went on to persuade the queen that he should not be deprived of his land.Echoing the supposed power of the stone, an Irish bard of the early 19th century, Francis Sylvester Mahony, added a number of (humorous) lines to Richard Alfred Millikin's \"The Groves of Blarney\" (right).\nAccording to tradition at Texas Tech University, a stone fragment on display since 1939 outside the old Electrical Engineering Building is a missing piece of the Blarney Stone. How this was determined is unknown.\n\n\n== Song ==\nThe traditional Irish song \"The Blarney Stone\" (Roud 4800) has been recorded by artists including Tom Lenihan, Margaret Barry and Bob Davenport.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnswering Stone\nKiss me, I'm Irish\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSamuel, Mark; Hamlyn, Kate (2007).

          "well worth a visit, interesting castle and gardens, very nice restaurant on site, lovely walks in garden.",
          "This is fun to do just to do it. You have to overcome the angle at which you are put at to kiss it and overcome any germ issues you might have. We came right after a good rain so we can pretend it was somewhat clean lol. Due to the angle at which you are titled, this might rule",
          "We were here just after the worst storm for years - trees down, couldn't visit the gardens so had to settle for just castle and 'the stone' - it has to be done! Quite a hike to the top of the castle with very steep steps but all safe. There are people there to help if you're not",
          "Arriving in Autumn and straight off the jet in Shannon on our way to Cork... and, after more than a dozen trips to Ireland I finally agreed to stop at Blarney Castle and kiss the ol' stone. There are also more than a dozen legends about the stone, most centered on it being a",
          "There were over 125 narrow steps to get to the Blarney Stone. Some people were obviously rather foolish to attempt the climb since there was no turning back. I went up but did not bother kissing the Blarney stone, just wanting to take photos and video. There is not much else to",
          "The origins of the Blarney Stone May be a load of Blarney, but it\u2019s definitely worth doing. The castle it\u2019s self is quite impressive. The stone is high up in the ramparts, but there is someone there to help you. The castle grounds are very well kept. Well worth a visit.",
          "I made my first trip to Blarney castle around 1981 , i came back with a friend in October 2017, The admission fee was 15 euros per head which was almost \u00a315 pound sterling. To say it was over priced would be an understatement and if you are daft enough to pay for the photo at",

          "The story \"kiss the stone\" should be called \"brake your backbone\". But the park has two very nice place : fairy garden and fern tree garden. You have to see them. The castle does not teache you anything and the main house was closed.",
          "The Irish know how to make money. We had to go kiss the blarney stone, and after climbing 100 irregular steps, we made it. Be prepared to lay down on your back and lean way back to kiss this famous rock. A staff will take a picture of this moment for you and you can have it all",
          "This is must see for anyone travelling around the south coast if Ireland. Amazing castle, the stairs are dug into the huge walls of the castle. You go back hundreds of years to medevial times. The kids loved it, all the nooks and crannys to be explored were awesome. And not",
          "So enjoyed our trip to kiss the Blarney Stone! We did a full tour of Ireland and didn't have long but managed to que up and get to the top within an hour. The stairways were quite steep and it was a long way up but so worth it. There were people to help you at the top which was",
          "This is nice to look at, but really isn't worth the heights, flies, wasps, half hour wait to get tickets, 15 euro tickets and a 2 hour wait to get up there.",
          "The grounds were nicely looked after and very clean. Castle was nice and lots of areas to explore on the journey to the top to kiss the stone. Escape route for the faint of heart. The stair cases did get quite tight and steep. Great views from the top.",
          "Of course we went to Blarney Castle! The line may be quite long (30 min to 3 hrs). What is important to realize is that to get to the Blarney stone, you will need to climb approx 12 flights of stone spiral staircase, one that is narrow, irregular and without handrails. Because",

          "Filling your bucket list? Ok, go do it but Ireland has so much more to offer than waiting 45 minutes to climb some stairs and kiss a stone that millions have kissed before. Go to the country and see some beauty. We walked the grounds while our friends kissed the stone. It is",
          "Blarney Castle and 'kissing' the stone was a fantastic moment. We arrived mid afternoon on the most beautiful sunny day. The grounds are impeccable and wonderfully kept. The flowers in bloom were sensational. We lined up for an hour waiting to ascend the very tight spiral",
          "We visited Blarney Castle and the Blarney stone ! Now first let me say this is not for the faint of heart. You walk a distance from the parking area to the Castle. Then you walk up the narrowest staircase you ever saw to get to the top of the Castle where the Blarney stone is. I",
          "We visited at around 4pm early in July and it was PERFECT timing. There were no bus tours at the venue and although there were people around it felt quiet and intimate. I am guessing that the tour buses came earlier in the day and had left by 4pm. The grounds and gardens were",

          "This was a quick visit on our way to our next destination. We decided to go straight to the castle to queue to kiss the Blarney Stone. It took us 40 minutes to reach the top by a narrow circular staircase. Cameras, glasses etc have to be removed before sitting down. You hold",
          "Blarney Castle was a nice stop on the first day of our tour. We had a great lunch at the Blarney Woolen Mills Cafe. Then we walked to the castle and enjoyed the beautiful grounds. We did not walk up to the Blarney Stone it was not something that we chose to do. But we enjoyed",
          "Of course kissing the Blarney Stone is an Ireland must do activity. Luckily, I didn't look up from the ground before climbing the castle steps or I probably would have chickened out. We had a long line, at least 45 minutes, but the climb is through the castle, which is fun and",
          "I've been told a already possess the 'gift of the gab' but gave the stone a kiss anyway, just for fun and why not while you are visiting the castle. Beautiful castle amongst some wonderful gardens.",

          "If you are going to the Blarney Castle and Gardens, you must go to the top of the castle to kiss the Blarney Stone. A tight, twisty squeeze to the top and back with very uneven steps. Do not attempt this if you have trouble with your hips, knees or back and especially do not go",
          "This place is huge with lots to do if you do not mind walking. The main attraction would be the castle and walking to the top. Just make sure you are not to large or tall and it should be an easy walk up to the top. The castle stairs are really tight. They also have beautiful",

          "The weather was perfect when I visited. The gardens are exceptional and spring is the most perfect time to visit. To get to the top of the castle to see the stone is a bit of a climb but well worth it and the castle has lots of beautiful nooks and crannies. Dont forget if",
          "Allow yourself enough time to tour the beautiful gardens. We arrived approximately 30 minutes before closing and barely had enough time to climb the spiral staircase to kiss the stone. The view from The top of the castle is absolutely breathtaking!",
          "We almost skipped the Blarney Castle and kissing the Blarney Stone for fear it would be altogether hokey, but it was a lot of fun! You have to lie down on your back, grab two vertical bars and actually slide downwards upside down in order to kiss the famed Blarney Stone... and",
          "We visited Blarney Castle on April 12, 2017. This was not our first visit, but it was a first for my kids. They really enjoyed climbing the spiral staircase and kissing the Blarney Stone. Walking around the various rooms and viewing the countryside from the top was really",

          "We came here with extreme Ireland day tours. The grounds are huge and I wish we would have had more time to explore. The line for the Stone was about 45 mins long when we got to it and about 2 hours long by the time we left. The stairs going up are very tiny-it almost makes you",
          "Spent a Sunday here. Absolutely beautiful to walk around and explore. Staff were very friendly and encourage my friend to kiss the Blarney Stone (she is terrified of heights). Don't think it would be enjoyable on a wet or windy day.",

          "If you're in the vicinity of Cork or Limerick a visit to Blarney Castle & the Blarney Stone is certainly worth it. The gardens are beautiful and the Castle fascinating. Getting up to the stone is fun although would be difficult if you struggle with steps. We went in January and",
          "We went in January when it was very quiet with no queues so we were stunned when we were charged \u20ac30 entrance for the two of us. I wonder do locals pay the same price? We tried to bargain but the desk lady was having none of it! The grounds were lovely to walk around in but I",
          "We loved everything about Ireland except for a contrary Leprechaun on the street in Dublin who refused to let us take a pic unless we paid him up front! The Blarney Stone is a bit of a gimmick, but hey, if you go to Ireland you have to kiss the Blarney Stone!",
          "The Blarney Stone is extremely mythological and it's at the top of the Blarney Castle. It's a tight spiral staircase to the top and the touristic thing to do is to lean backwards over a wall, extend one's arms, arch over and kiss the stone. The price for a pic is \u20ac35. I did not",
          "You hear about the Blarney stone all of your life and this was less than impressive. The castle itself is really small and really the hype is to get you to the top to kiss the Blarney stone. The stone is not remarkable and not even distinguished well. The workers at the top",
          "Went on a group tour with family. The floors of the castle are non existent and you have to walk along an edge to reach the top. Learned my 10 is afraid of heights. Made it too the top where you can kiss the stone for good luck. Great experience.",
          "After climbing up stairs to the top of the castle we got to Kiss the Stone. For those of heights like myself I conquered that fear. I visited in with a bunch of friends and had a great time. Love the castle and the stone.",
          "We visited Ireland in September/October, 2016 and rented a car to drive all over this beautiful country. When we got to the town of Blarney (which was quite nice!) we drove to Blarney Castle (which was a highlight of the trip). Once inside Blarney Castle we trekked up the stairs",

          "Ignoring the fact of germs (ew), this was really fun. It's a steep climb to the top of the castle and then a dude helps you down to kiss the Blarney stone. Definitely glad I did it and it wasn't scary at all being upside down like that when you are so high up!",
          "The Blarney Castle and grounds are definitely a worthwhile visit. I have seen many castles and while Blarney is not the most well preserved (Warwick in the UK tops my list) it has a nice grounds and gardens area. Kissing the Blarney Stone is, of course, a popular reason to",
          "Some people have putting their lips on a rock that thousands of others have as a bucket list item. Do it if you must. However, going to see the castle and grounds are completely worth it.",
          "Apparently I won't have it. Beautiful castle and grounds. Nice waterfall. This was a must see for my friend. There was no line this time of year. I tried going up the stairs but the higher you go the more narrow the stairway. I got claustrophobic towards the top so I backed out.",
          "was a great experience going to Ireland, seeing all the stone buildings, castles and views. the Blarney stone was an unique experience having to climb up to the top of the castle and the view was fantastic. The experience was different than what I had expected. well worth",

          "It was great to finally go to Blarney Castle and kiss the \"stone\". We were there at the end of the day around 5.30 pm and there was no queue. The spiral stairs you have to climb to get to the top of the castle where the stone is, are steep and built for small people so you need",

          "All four of our family went up. One actually kissed the stone, and the other two blew kisses to the stone. The fourth did not want to risk cancelling out the gift, so just watched the others. Great fun!",
          "So, I knew about having to kiss the Blarney stone laying down.....BUT....i didn't know how high in the tower you were....and how far back you had to lay down to get up-side-down to do it!! It was exhilarating, fun, scary....and a MUST DO if you are in the area. The line",
          "Worth the stand in line. You walk up the castle's spiral stairs to the top of the castle. Beautiful views. If you are claustrophobic this is not for you. The stairs get very narrow near the top and there is not much room to be able to allow someone up or down. The gentleman who",
          "We loved this area. Kissed the stone for a unique experience. (If you're paranoid about germs, as a couple of people suggested, just wipe your lips with an alcohol wipe). The gardens and lake walk are beautiful. We really enjoyed this lovely place.",
          "You can spend a whole day at Blarney Castle - it is huge and beautiful. There is so much to do here.There are lake walks,riverside walks,the beautiful themed gardens - such as the poison garden,Irish garden etc. If you like a challenge then try the wishing steps.Legend says that",
          "When you reach the top of Blarney Castle and approaching the Blarney Stone there are some amazing views. While you do have to kiss the stone upside down and backwards it's easy to do. Anyone can really do it. There are also two men who are there to help. It's about 45 minutes to",
          "The path leading to the stone is magical! First after paying admission you go through a beautiful garden reaching the castle Than You go through the castle up a circle narrow steps up up up to the roof! The View is beautiful & the scene is astonishing! Cows, green fields, farms",
          "This was my second time kissing the Blarney Stone. I found that visiting this attraction during the weekend was much quieter than at the weekend. It is also a good idea to go early. It was 13 euro of an adult to visit the castle and grounds. Just be careful as the stone spiral",
          "You are always told about leaning back to kiss the stone, you are not told about standing side by side on a narrow spiral staircase!! It definitely is an experience and its a relief to get to the top! It is a great attraction well organised with lovely gardens! I loved the craft",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone was a tick off the bucket list! Well set out, beautiful gardens... Steps up to the stone were not for the faint hearted! But well worth while if you were physically able! Views were spectacular .",
          "You cannot go to Cork and not kiss the Blarney. Yes its touristy, yes it seems crazy - but you are visiting Ireland and the Blarney is so Irish. The stone is at the top of the castle... the castle is great and worth seeing itself. The passage way to the top is very narrow but",
          "Blarney Castle is very cool but don't expect much trying to kiss the Blarney Stone. We get there early as we heard you can wait for hours, and we heard around 10:30 this Monday morning the was 2 hours. Our wait was only 20min as we arrived 9:30 via ECoach on Butler Cork and",
          "This was a must ! The surroundings are great ! The castle is incredible ! The Ascension is incredible , one has to be fit ! The number of tiny thin stairs is enormous , the kissing is perilous but worth it ! I am expecting great changes in my life after this perilous kiss !!",
          "It was a damp and cool spring day to start. When we walked to the castle I looked up and thought, I'll never make it. I have some mobility and height issues. My husband was up on top in 5 minutes and was waving me on. He came down and guided me up the winding and open",
          "Beautiful grounds around the Castle very well kept. The castle itself is a beautiful sight. Don't br discouraged by the line to kiss the stone. I think it was worth waiting. Fun.",
          "I was reticent about visiting what I thought would be a truly 'touristy' castle and noted as one of the '100 things you must do before you die' list. Wrong.. We arrived right on opening time which was smart given the number of tourist buses that arrived just a few minutes",
          "When we went it was 1.5 hour line to kiss the stone and the line weaves through the castle, so you cannot see the inside of the castle without getting in the line. It was well worth the wait though to see the castle and kiss the stone. When we asked the teller he said that the",
          "I do not believe people urinate on it, due to the fact that it is at least 3 stories high,it is also a very narrow staircase and most likely locked at night. It is another place you can say you have visited.",
          "As others have said the Blarney stone is a small part of this place. The 60 Acres and beautiful gardens are truly the highlight. Its a peaceful place to wander and take in the beauty.",

          "Why go to Ireland and not kiss the Blarney Stone? The climb to the stone is a little precarious. Be sure to wear comfortable and appropriate footwear. The climb consists of several tight spiral staircases with minimal hand holds and you could potentially be standing in a line",
          "Why visit Ireland and not kiss the Blarney Stone? Well I had to do this. What a fun activity. We had about 3 hours here. We booked a tour group for our daily trip. I recommend heading to the Blarney Stone immediately. We didn't have a long line. During the warmer months you",
          "Set in beautiful grounds, with interesting tales to match. The trek up the tower to kiss the Blarney Stone is by narrow steps, so ensure you've got suitable footwear, and if you're squeamish about putting your lips where the thousands of others have take some cling film or buy",
          "Let me preface that I am rather afraid of heights. You meander your way through the castle looking at the different rooms and their uses. It feel old and medieval. You eventually make your way to the top to stand in line to kiss the stone. There is a nice view up there, and the",
          "What a great place to visit! The gentleman holding you while you kiss the stone was fantastic and fun! The gal selling the pictures at the bottom was great! It's definitely a climb to the top and very enclosed but we'll worth it! I don't know if we ever did find the waterfall",
          "As a group of men on a stag do of course the single ones would like the gift of the gab! Legend says that who kisses the stone will have good luck with the ladies/men. To be honest it may have worked as the single lads had lots of luck in Cork that night! There's lots to do at",
          "The trip to the Blarney Stone was something we were told we had to do. We did stop in town for a pint which was nice and enjoyed the grounds and castle. This is certainly a lovely experience but it felt very touristy especially with the photography that takes place as you are",
          "This is definitely a wonderful place to visit. The walk leading up to the Blarney Stone has such beautiful scenery. The castle is nice. I could not kiss the Blarney Stone due to a boot on my right foot. I did like that there was a store to buy gifts. Worth a visit.",
          "I had told everyone I was definitely going to kiss the stone, that was before I saw the height and the narrow staircase. However, I decided just to go for it and luckily for me there was not a sole in front of me so no waiting on the stairs, which did get very narrow and steep",
          "We toured around Ireland for my daughter's 22nd birthday and visiting Blarney Castle was one of our highlights! There were very few people exploring the castle when we arrived around noon. The windy, narrow stone staircase leading up to the top of the castle is very steep! (If",
          "You have to be fit to climb the spiral stairs but views from the top of the tower were great. Lines moved quickly , and a bit rushed and don't think I actually kissed the stone as a bit nerve wracking hanging backwards out over the edge but something to talk about. The grounds",
          "A trip too Ireland would not be complete without one kissing the Blarney Stone. The 1-2 hour trip up to the stone is not really boring, as views,of the gardens, from various floors are spectacular. The opportunity to see and read about the castle, as one climbs the stairs makes",
          "This is something that I have wanted to do since I was a child. Being from an Irish background I knew lots of people who had done this so I was quite excited when I was going to Cork for a wedding knowing I could knock this one off my bucket list. It did not disappoint. To kiss",
          "This was a great experience. The castle is so unique and beautiful. The stairs are a bit slim but there are hand rails on both sides which were useful. Every so often the stairs would lead to a room that you could go into to have a rest. Very interesting place to explore.",
          "Set in lovely gardens, the Blarney Castle is a great day out ... no only do you get the gilf of the gab after kissing the stone, you also get to enjoy the lovely views from the top and the beautiful gardens.",
          "Do you really want to lay and your back on the ground with the top half of your body hanging out over the edge and then arch up and kiss a stone that hundreds of others in the line before you have already kissed? No thanks but the view from the top is worth the climb.",
          "This was the longest line-up of all the attractions we went to see in our complete tour of Ireland. The enclosed spiral staircase gets narrower and narrower the higher you get; not for anyone with bad knees or fear of tight spaces (or heights).",
          "Growing up Irish in Boston, I had always heard of the Blarney Stone and how you had to kiss it to obtain the 'gift of gab'. My ancestors came to American from Cork, Ireland so it was ironic that this was the place where I finally put my feet on the 'old sod'. Getting from the",
          "You just can't come and not kiss the Blarney Stone. Yes you will need to wait in line and climb many stairs but the view from the top is worth it. And since you have come this far, go ahead and lie down, beck over backwards and kiss the stone. There is always someone there to",

          "If you travel to Ireland you have to Kiss the Blarney Stone.......so this is a must stop on your journey. If you read some of the reviews it sounds like a daunting climb to the top but it is not. It is actually a very easy climb and the views from the top are to die",
          "After walking up a very narrow winding spiral staircase I felt i needed oxygen when I eventually reached the top To kiss the Blarney Stone is not an east task if you are under 6ft I am only 5ft 2in so lying on my back to kiss that stone is a terrifying experience You lie down",
          "When I think of Ireland I think of leprechaun, shamrock, pubs and the Blarney Stone to name a few. The Blarney Stone has no real historical significance but the story is magical and so Irish. The crowds are by the bus loads though! The grounds are beautiful so you could spend a",
          "This was an amazing place. Worth seeing at least once in your life. One thing is the stone is not accessible for handicapped. You do need to lay on your back and hold on to the 2 bars and kiss it. Also, it is quite a hike of spiral stairs to reach the very top and if you are",
          "Fortunately the weather was on the cool side or it may have been more difficult to climb over 100 steps. If you have a below average lung capacity this may not be the excursion for you! If you are able to go at a slow pace & you don't have people behind you then it's possible to",
          "You travel all the way to Ireland, be anywhere near the blarney stone and not go see it. I have heard the wait can get long, but we lucked out and our wait was short. They will take a picture of you kissing the stone and you can buy it afterwards. I can't remember exactly how",
          "We kissed the Blarney stone. Awesome view from the top of the castle. Kissing the stone was more changing than we thought. Seeing the Castle and learning the history was well worth the time.",
          "Blarney Castle is beautiful. Kissing the stone is a must. The queue can get long, we had an hour of a wait but worth persevering. You can see people kissing the stone from the bottom and it looks scary but its not half as bad up there. The guys are very friendly at the top and",
          "A lovely experience. Lovely gardens and scenery. Wear comfortable shoes to walk around the area. Beautiful small waterfalls. Cheap entry. If you do want to kiss the blarney stone get there early to avoid disappointment. The queue was at least an hour wait inside a tower on the",
          "Worth the wait and the climb. They do charge you admission and you should tip the holder (he holds you out so you can kiss the stone) and they will take photos for you. Then you have to pay again for the certificate and photos, but its worth it. The climb is long, and there is",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone is a must if you are in southern Ireland . Its seems higher than the pictures show and you have to lay on your back and lean out but they are holding you up. Kind of scary.",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone is a must for every visitor to Ireland. The climb up 5 stories of narrow spiral stairs is surprisingly easy; it helps to be in a lineup. You have to lie on your back and look up to kiss the stone but it is impossible to fall, even without someone",
          "Interesting. You have to hang upside down to kiss the stone. They push you through pretty quick. The castle is cool but the gardens are even more so. You could spend a whole day wandering around between this and the woolen mills.",
          "Even if you're not Irish, kissing the Blarney Stone is a must do for anyone who believes in magic. The grounds of the castle are just breathtaking and once you climb the stairs to the Blarney Stone, the vista will take your breath away. The stairs may be a challenge to some,",
          "Went up the long stair case, along side a million other people, kissed the stone, had my photo taken - but decided it was an ok day, oh yes it rained alot",
          "There is no doubt you must visit the Blarney Stone and kiss it! The grounds leading to the Blarney Stone are beautiful and the castle is real! Ireland was on my bucket list and I had to do every iconic thing I had ever heard about Ireland. Some may think this is a little",
          "We did a driving tour of Ireland and just had to visit Blarney Castle. We had to go up a lot of steps but this was worth it. Along the way up the stairs you can go off into rooms of the castle and then go back and go up more stairs. It felt like most people just chose to",
          "We arrived just after they opened as we were camping nearby so we missed all the tour buses, at 9.30am there were no queues at all and we went straight up to kiss the stone. It was scarier than it looks but it's one of those things you just have to do!",
          "While traveling through Ireland, I had to stop and kiss the Blarney Stone. The line was long, but it moved fast. It was still worth the wait. If you travel through Ireland, the Blarney Stone needs to be on the list.",
          "We stopped here around 4:00 in the afternoon and went right up to the top to kiss the stone no wait at all. After that we strolled around the beautiful grounds which we practically had to ourselves.",
          "Got to kiss the stone during my wife and my trip driving around Ireland. We went right before closing time and got to see everything without the crowd. The caves under the castle and the poison garden was rally cool to see. This was one of the only castles that we paid to go",
          "Our tour stopped at Blarney Castle. We walked around the grounds and into the bottom floor of the castle. Because of our age, we did not climb the stairs to the Blarney Stone. We were able to view the opening for the stone from the ground.",
          "I wasn't sure how to rate it. Of course everyone wants to kiss the blarney stone but it is difficult to get to it. I really wanted to kiss the blarney stone but it was a 125 steps up once you were in the Castle and the walk up to the castle was a pretty high graded hill to get",
          "Great experience however not for those in fear of heights, small spaces, or germs. A lot of small steps in a mostly confined space only to reach the top and kiss a castle wall that thousands of others have kissed ;) On a lighter note my family and I laughed most of the way up",
          "At top of blarney castle \u20ac13 admission, very steep steps up to it, not recommended if claustrophobic to scared of heights, quite a scary experience kissing the stone, but you don't have to do this",
          "This is a great experience but there can be long waits.We went early and people flowed through easily.You can look at the gardens after the experience and that is well worthy of the time.The other trap appears to be if cruise ships are in,the waiting time can really blow",
          "I was not going to kiss the Blarney stone, but once I got up to the top of the castle, my thoughts of all the germs left me and I just did it! So glad I did! They take a great picture of you doing it, that you are able to purchase at the bottom of the castle! So much history",
          "it seemed silly, but the experience was worth the wait in line. You get to meander up the staircase and view the actual rooms and take breathtaking photos. As you climb higher, the beauty alone is well worth your time. The line went pretty fast, however. maybe 20 minute",
          "Recently visited Ireland and wen to the Blarney Stone Castle. You must cllimb approx. 150 steps to get to the top. The stairs get narrower as you climb up. It was well worth it. In order to kiss the stone. --- you lay down and put your ahead over the side and kiss up toward",
          "As tourists we had heard about kissing the stone, which is really good fun. The castle and grounds are also good fun to explore. Many photo oppurtunity were had, as well as the perfect photo kissing the stone.",
          "As you go along the steep stairs ( small steps because I have big feet! ), you'll notice a lot of written names and words engraved on the castle stone walls. It got me thinking tourists doesn't have the time to do this, those names or words were there hundreds of years ago. I",
          "To visit this is a waste of time and effort! It was difficult to find the right road to get to the village of Blarney from Cork! The massive queue and the numerous steep steps to reach the top of the old castle ruin was a let down once reached! You have to lay down and reach",
          "A friend told us it was boring and she didnt go up into the tower when she visited. So, we almost skipped it. Thank goodness we didn't! It was the best part of the trip so far. The stairs were not that steep nor did it seem that there were as many as reported. We made it up and",
          "The castle was honestly one of my favorites in SW Ireland. We went at 3:00 on a thursday and there was virtually no line (4 people in front of us). The grounds were bigger than I anticipated so give yourself at least a couple of hours to explore.",
          "Visited on a sunny view so the castle was stunning from ground level and from its top down. Surrounding gardens are worth a walk through by themselves. Effort to scale the 14th century castle to kiss the stone was an effort but well worth it. Its a must do.",
          "What a beautiful place! I was petrified kissing the stone,you do this backwards!!! glad to say I came out in one piece. Everyone was so helpful and the views are simply stunning. Im so glad that I made it to Blarney the castle was beautiful. The little town has an array of shops",
          "One of the most terrifying yet amazing things i have ever done in my live. There is nothing like laying over a hole, backwards, high up in the air, to kiss a stone. The castle is amazing and the gardens are a nice relaxing walk. This is a Must See.",
          "It's a stunning setting, the grounds are beautiful and the castle is picturesque. Three of us kissed the stone, aged 7 years to 60. We loved the climb up the stairs and the view of the property from the top of the castle. The kiss itself was nice, as others say they help you",
          "I kissed the Blarney Stone! Absolutely gorgeous area of the country. Worth the historic visit. Rolling green lawns, a river running thru. You will see wedding couples being photographed and horseback riders on the grounds.",
          "We went on a family vacation. 4 years old through 40. There are stairs to climb, and the stone seems anticlimactic, but you won't regret it! Even the 8 year old kissed it.",
          "This is a very picturesque area and surprisingly serine! The Blarney Stone itself seems a bit of a sham with regards to getting a picture of it with a guy it, that and it really does look like the rest of the castle. We really enjoyed the views of the castle, the river walk and",
          "We visited the Castle and the Blarney Stone because after all, you can't go to Ireland without visiting it, right? Actually it was better than we expected. The grounds are beautiful and even though it was January, they were pretty and well manicured. The castle is amazing and",
          "Tourist trap but something you have to do. Castle grounds are completely worth visiting so stop by the stone on your way through :-)",
          "My grandma used to always say 'When you go to Ireland, you must kiss the Blarney Stone' and that is exactly what I did. It's easy to get to Blarney Castle from the central bus station in Cork. The return ticket is about nine euro for an adult, but your ticket can be used on any",
          "11 th century. Preserved well. Great signage. Great stories. Fun destinations ( Kiss the historic Barney stone at the 5 story top) a true poison garden. No way ! Yes way! A super fern garden/ waterfall. A cave ! Magical grounds. Irish gardens. A Himalayas trek hike.Niiiice",
          "I had always heard about the Blarney Stone, and this is something that I wanted to do. If you are not able to climb a lot of steps - then this isn't for you, though. The steps to the top are very steep and narrow. There wasn't too much of a wait, but the actual kiss takes",
          "There was a lot to see here even in winter. The manor was closed but the castle and grounds were open. Plenty of stuff to take pictures of. The walk to the top was narrow. After climbing those stairs leaning over to kiss the stone made me dizzy. There was no wait so perhaps in",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone was simply on my list of things to do in Ireland. The castle and the grounds were very nice and I enjoyed my visit. Nice view from the top of the castle. A buddy and I took a taxi from downtown Cork to visit the site. We just wanted to do a quick visit",
          "If in ireland this is a must see and do, its a little difficult to actually kiss the Blarney Stone but you have to give it a try !",
          "Scary enough with the big drop beneath the stone, but good for some culture and a laugh with friends! Would recommend!",
          "Kissed the Blarney Stone and now I am \"cursed\" with the gift of gab. One of those things you can say you did once at a St. Patricks Day party.",
          "Okay, to some it may be just a stone but it's all in good fun whether you believe in its magical powers or not. Besides, where else could you kiss a stone by dangling off battlements while a kind Irishman holds on to your legs?",
          "What beautiful grounds the Blarney Castle has! We thoroughly enjoyed our walk from the entrance to the actual castle and stone. Getting to the stone entails climbing some narrow stone steps but we are of just average fitness and had no difficulty. Although to kiss the stone",
          "Of course you have to do this if given the opportunity! Even though it is the 2nd germiest place in the world! You walk up some stairs, lie on your back, kiss the stone, get a pic taken with the option of purchasing, then you're rushed away. I went when it wasn't real busy and",
          "the gardens are wonderful! The Blarney Stone is fun and lives up to its reputation, if a bit over publicized. It is fun, but a tough walk up the 110 steps in the turret. Atypical old castle, if yo havent been to 10 others by this time, you ca see the castle, have some",
          "All and all one must climb the stairs to get to the top but it is worth it. You must lie on your back and arch your head to kiss it. It was a good thing I travel with my Chiropractor,",
          "Entering into the grounds Blarney castle soon appears set on the hill. we made our way up the path, joining the queue to enter the castle. It was up the steep steps hanging onto the rope rail. Upon reaching the top there was time to appreciate the gardens and grounds. Then it",
          "I think we came at the right time of year! Mid week in the middle of September. We had a wonderful sunny day and the castle looked truly spectacular. There is so much incredible history to this place and I had no idea how long it stretched back until I got here. To be honest, I",
          "is if you kissed the Blarney Stone. If you can get past the 100 or so stone circular stairs from the 1600s to get to the top (sounds worse than they are), go for it. There are lots of ropes and rails to hold on to, keep both hands free if you can for safety going up. Several",
          "It was on the to do list so off we went.. We brought a picnic and there are plenty seats and tables with beautiful scenery. Pleasent and relaxing day, nice place to visit but the \u20ac10 for the photo at the kissing of the stone is a rip off. We were a family of two adults and four",
          "We agree it is touristy, but it is a must see also the gardens as well. The whole experience is well worth it. We had a slight bit of rain but it did not dull the spirit of anyone in the line. The line moves at a steady pace despite the steps up the tower There is live music",
          "Sure its 100% touristy but it makes such a great story. Besides, the trip there and back is most of the fun. If it all possible I recommend renting/hiring a car and making a day trip of it (or longer and follow the Ring of Kerry) and just stop along the way whenever you feel",
          "Ok, so this is a tourisy thing to do but it was also one of our favorites for a couple of reasons. First, it's iconic for Ireland and it's fun to say that we experienced it. Second, the fun of exploring an old castle made it worth it for us. There is nothing inside this",
          "It was a narrow climb up the castle tower and even though I suffer from claustrophobia I was fine because there was plenty of light and ventilation. View from the top was spectacular. The 'kiss' must be done although you need to be quite flexible and not scared of heights. The",
          "Do you know how you see Ireland in movies and in the movies it full of castles, flowers and its so green and lush? Well thats what Blarney looks like. Blarney castle is about 2-3 hours away from Dublin by train then followed by a 15min bus ride from cork to the castle. Other",
          "We visited Blarney Castle . The Blarney Stone is at the top of the castle so you do have to climb some steep narrow stone steps but it is well worth it to see and kiss the Blarney Stone . I was terrified as not only was we high up you had to lean backwards and kiss the Blarney",
          "Even though it was raining and we had to queue for an hour and get really wet and had to climb 100 steps up a narrow winding precipitous stone staircase, I did have to do it. It was on my to-do list for Ireland. Dont know that I have the Blarney now though...",
          "There is so much to see. The gardens are well kept and lovely to stroll round. To kiss the Blarney stone you climb to the top of the castle and then have to lie flat and pull yourself out and up to kiss the stone thankfully there is someone there to help and definately not for",
          "The grounds of the castle are well landscaped with beautiful gardens. To kiss the stone-you need to walk up a winding close walled stairway to the open top of the castle-then lie down, where a man holds you, to squeeze through an opening to kiss the stone! It is a unique-albeit",
          "I was not sure if I would be able to climb to the top, but I did! It was a little scary going up the skinny steps holding on to the rope (holding on very carefully). It seemed to be a long time going up, but the view at the top is spectacular! I now have the gift of eloquence,",
          "Get there early to avoid lines. The actual stone is located at the top of the castle. The scenery is breathtaking worth going all the way to the top. It's a little awkward at the way you have to sit to kiss the stone. A lot of steps involved, wear good shoes and enjoy.",
          "I avoided kissing the blarney stone, but enjoyed the castle and grounds. Its definitely worth a visit!",
          "As the title says, you dont really want to wait in line behind 2 or 3 tour buses... It can be a long wait to clomb the castle and kiss the stone! We stayed nearby (Blarney golf Resort) so we were there by about 930 in the morning, had the stone done (15 min wait) before noon. By",
          "I always thought the Blarney stone was at ground level, but there you go, it's actually at the top of the Castle. Luckily we got there on a fine day but the queue was longer than I expected. My suggestion is, if the weather looks iffy take along a brolly or raincoat ,a drink,",
          "I traveled thousands of miles....I'm kissing the blarney stone. My wife...not so much (worried about touching her lips to where thousands have). So we slathered her in 1/4\" of lip gloss: problem solved, lol. Its a bit ackward to position yourself but if you've trudged all those",
          "The best part of Blarney Castle isn't the stone. The castle is surrounded by lots of different gardens. They even have a garden with poison plants. Interesting place. You could spend a couple of hours walking around. Afterwards...check out the largest locally made Irish",
          "We visited the Blarney Castle, including the Blarney House and of course the Blarney Stone. It was great, plenty to see. Plenty of walks. We kissed the Blarney Stone. Took us about an hour to reach the top, but it was well worth it. Best to go as early as possible. Otherwise",
          "Lively historic grounds. The stone itself is a small space at top of castle that you have to lay on the ground face up to kiss. You are rushed to do so and it's all single file. It's a narrow walkway but the view from atop us gorgeous. I suppose it's a must do but Cork part of",
          "So much more than the stone, lots to see and do in grounds but my group only had 2 1/2 hrs. Long line for the stone, so go early, but worth it, hard to get a good picture yourself but u can buy one. I would spend more time in the grounds.",
          "Best to arrive when the area opens, because when the tour buses arrive there will be long lines at the castle to get to the stone. We still experienced a 15 minute wait arriving as early as we did. The walk through the grounds is awesome; well groomed gardens and hedges. Explore",
          "Our tour guide recommended skipping this \"tourist trap,\" but we went anyway--and were SO glad we did! I had absolutely no idea what kissing the Blarney Stone actually entails, and it was hilarious! The castle itself is rather majestic--one of my favorites that we saw--and the",
          "I had been to kiss the Blarney Stone before and I was bringing my two teenagers for their first time. The grounds and the castle are gorgeous. The man working at the top was very rude and short with us. We were there near the end of the day and he acted like we were bothering",
          "It was a fair bit of money to get in and there were a lot of families that come so the line can get long (so I recommend you get there as early as possible). The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The stairs inside the castle are a bit claustrophobic, so be mindful of that.",
          "First of all, the castle ruins and surrounding gardens are pretty spectacular. That said, the thing to do there, it seems, is to kiss the Blarney Stone at the top of the castle. Be forewarned: Getting to the top is not for the fainthearted. The Stone is at the top of the 90-foot",
          "We did not find out until we had arrived that the steps going up to the Blarney stone were 120 and you also had to come down the same amount. Apparently they narrow near the top and are a little difficult to navigate. That left me out although I thought the price for a crumbled",
          "We all took a lovely trip to see the Blarney Stone. The only bad thing about this trip was the weather but that's to be expected in ireland! Just be prepared for hail, rain or sunshine :-)",
          "If you get the chance visit Blarney Castle. Beautiful grounds and breathtaking scenery make the visit that much more enjoyable. Waiting in line can be a challenge however arriving early makes the visit more enjoyable. The stairways are dark and narrow, however this only adds to",
          "Well worth the visit. One of the few castles where you have practically full access. You can kiss the Blarney Stone and have a good look through the whole area. We had an awesome visit.",
          "This attraction has so much more to offer than just the Blarney Stone. The Castle and Gardens are beautiful, and there are a lot of areas to explore on the grounds. There are also shops to explore if you want to take home a souvenier from the attraction.",
          "What a fun stop. It's certainly a touristy place but the architecture and history here is beautiful. So glad we stopped and kissed the blarney stone. Well worth the trip. Local shops in the area have beautiful made in Ireland gifts and wool.",
          "Most people go for to kiss the stone, and that is really cool and a very unique experience. It is definitely something that will separate this experience from those of any other castle you happen to visit. However, the castle has far more to offer. Personally, I loved the",
          "What fun we had... climbing around the castle, exploring the beautiful grounds, discovering some interesting facts while exploring the poison garden, and, of course, kissing the Blarney Stone! The park surrounding the castle is just lovely and the views from the top are",

          "This by far was one of my favorites that I visited while in Ireland. The grounds were beautiful! The poison garden was interesting and informative. The blarney castle was one of the few that I was able to go into. Loved reading the information inside the castle and of course",
          "You need to go up in the Blarney Castle to find the Blarney Stone. The area is very dark, and has winding steps. You must be in good shape to climb so many steps up, and down. When you arrive at the Blarney Stone , you just can not kiss it. It is is required for you to act like",
          "One cannot go to Ireland and not kiss the Blarney Stone...you must do it at least once in your life! Blarney Castle itself is quite a sight, one of the most photogenic castles in Ireland - going there in the fall with the vibrant foliage as a backdrop made for a storybook",
          "I have a fear of falling down steps, since it has happened to me on numerous occasions, so when I arrived at the Blarney Castle and found that it had a teeny, tiny, spiral staircase, I became nervous. The steps were steep and wet and the only thing to hold onto was a rope. The",
          "On our first trip to Europe in May 2010, we chose Ireland. When we got to the castle, no one wanted to kiss the stone! They didn't want to climb up the steps haha. Well, I thought, I didn't come all the way across the Atlantic to not go up there and kiss the stone. So off we",

          "Okay, it is a little bit touristy, but if you do not go it would be like going to New York and skipping the Empire State Building. We went to The Blarney Stone on a Viator Day Trip from Dublin. The grounds are pretty and the castle is awesome. I had a bad left ankle and I was",
          "The castle and grounds are amazing, excellent views of surrounding countryside. Surprised how close Blarney is to Cork. Definitely recommend!",
          "Beautiful castle & grounds. Lush green with beautiful shrubbery. We were there off-season, so there were only 4-5 other travelers climbing up to kiss the stone. Perfect timing!! The gentleman assisting visitors must live there as I've seen his picture for years & years. He",
          "Best place to be on a lazy sunday. Grounds are absolutely stunning, the castle is great...except of kissing the stone, won't and never will. A must see",
          "The visit to Blarney would have been much better but for the Rain. Firstly you notice the well maintained gardens then as you walk toward the Castle.After crossing a bridge, you are treated to the site of a Castle that appears to be part of the large rock on which it sits. The",

          "This wasn't on my top favorites and I would definitely hate wait in line to kiss the stone in summer time with the long lines. I agree, you do walk through some small stairs and are herded to the stone. If you are claustrophobic...do not do this one.",
          "The Blarney Castle site is enormous (took us about an hour just to see the stone). Blarney Stone closes 30 mins prior to sundown and we reached there around 2:30. We saved time by purchasing tickets online & 10% (12 \u20ac). From the car park we walked about quarter mile before",
          "12 euro for admission to stand in line for over an hour to go into a castle that is just the structure with placards that say what the rooms would have been like. You walk through small stairs to get to the roof where you get herded to the stone. Of course if you want your own",
          "Yes, this is a very touristy thing to do, but I recommend it anyway! Not only were the castle grounds beautiful, and the castle really cool (lovely views, and fun to learn about), but kissing the stone was a highlight of our trip to Ireland. This was a bucket list item for me,",
          "I write good in the title and not great - we have done a lot of tourist attractions in the past 3 weeks and this was a good one...not a great one. It was good to kiss the Blarney Stone - not sure it does anything but was not going to miss out! All over very quickly though and",
          "Visited the castle early Sunday morning. Not busy at this time felt like we were only ones in castle. Grounds worth the time to explore truly magical.",
          "The queue was long but the day perfect. Had good views of the castle grounds from the ruins of Blarney castle. Shame photography by with your own camera from the best angle is not allowed and the photo by the photographer is expensive (\u20ac10). Lovely grounds. Coffee mass produced",
          "The stone is at the top of a castle. You take very narrow spiral stairs to the top. Once you get up there, an older gentleman has you lay down and lean upside down to kiss the stone. Not at all what I expected! Dont miss out on this unique experience!!",
          "It was our first time in Ireland and as we were close to Blarney felt we couldn't miss the chance to head on over and kiss the Blarney Stone and visit the castle. My expectations were to expect something very touristy and not much but the stone. Happily I found something so much",
          "If you are in Ireland, please do yourself a favor and make sure to kiss the Blarney Stone. It is an invigorating hoot!! You climb up the spiral staircase through a ruined castle, and the slow trip up allows you to enjoy the views of both the landscape and the different rooms",
          "The Blarney Stone was not what I expected. The grounds surrounding Blarney Castle are gorgeous. The climb up to the top of the Castle was surprisingly steep and narrow, which made the climb kind of fun. The Blarney Stone is a flat rock embedded in a wall that surrounds the",

          "The hype for this attraction far exceeds the experience ,but it is the blarney that captures us all. The gardens and grounds are immaculate, park like. The climb to the kissing rock will test most as we appear to be a bigger size than the generations that built this castle.",
          "The Blarney Stone is not what I expected at all!! I thought it would be a big stone, not the bottom of a castle wall. And the kissing (which I didn't do)- you almost have to be an acrobat to do it. I was very disappointed in it.",
          "On arrival and after waiting for 15 minutes to get to the entrance we found that the card machine was not working and cash only. Had to go across to the local supermarket to get some cash before rejoining the queue. A sign at the queue point would have been helpful. Massive",
          "This is not someplace to miss. Even if you do not want to climb the small scary stairs to the top (which is worth it!) you could walk around the castle grounds and see beautiful gardens and wonderful views. The kissing of the stone is 3 stories up and you lean over the side of",
          "Hyped up for tourists. Expensive but people think they should see it when in Cork. My wife and I fell for the hype and regret it. Expensive and no concessions for Seniors. We made the difficult climb ti the Stone and it was awful. Dirty - never cleaned - who knows what",
          "The castle tour is worthwhile and of course the Blarney Stone experience is a must. However, the grounds have other features worth exploring as well. We also toured King John's castle and Kilkenny castle...this was by far the best.",

          "I went expecting this to be a typical tourist trap thing. However I Was pleasantly surprised. Kissing the Blarney stone is kind of a must on a visit to Ireland. The climb up to the stone is quite a feat. You have to climb quite a few small narrow winding stairs to reach the top",
          "I went into this experience with low expectations, too many people, tourist trap, etc. But it was great! You have the opportunity to climb ancient stairs through multiple rooms of the castle, peering out of the windows at the amazing views. Kissing the actual stone is pretty",

          "Certainly touristy but worth the trip. The castle sits on beautiful grounds, but so do many in Ireland. We made the trek dutifully as it was recommended. Kissing the Blarney Stone which is the advertised highlight was a commercial production. You climb up through the castle and",

          "Between my mother, my sister and I, I was the only one who was able to walk to the top of the castle to partake in the activity of kissing the Blarney Stone. There is a lot of walking to the castle, but the difficult part was the walk up the narrow stone stairs to the top.",
          "Had alot of fun. The only down side is all those stairs!! OMG they seem to never end! The castle is really nice, almost every floor has a walk off to go look around at the rooms. They have updated alot. No wait to kiss the stone, and yes I DID!!",

          "We absolutely loved the Blarney Castle tour. The castle was impressive and the grounds surrounding it were gorgeous. A must do is the climb to the top to kiss the Blarney stone or just look and take pictures from the top. Its a slow walk to the top but worth doing. There is",

          "Beautiful grounds with flowers everywhere! Neat places everywhere you turn. Kissing the stone is not for those with fear of heights as you have to hang (with assistance) upside down and backward at the top of the tower. My kids 1, 3, 4 enjoyed their time with forests,",

          "Went here with some Canadian friends who were very keen to kiss the Blarney Stone. I wasn't interested in that and thought that the trip might be a dissapointing one for myself because of that, however the castle and gardens are really worth a visit. The castle is interesting,",

          "I first kissed the Blarney Stone during a 3-week tour of the British Isles in August, 1970--when I was a mere 19 years old. After that day, I have been blessed with a gift--I can speak to anyone, anywhere, anytime, anyplace with absolute confidence! It emboldened me to become",
          "This is a must do for anyone visiting Ireland. It was so much fun and worth the long wait. We had to wait in a long line that winds throughout the castle. Anyone who is clausterphobic may have a problem getting to the top, but DO IT! It is so worth it. The grounds are beautiful"

Very nice experience overall! Although overly expensive and frustrating you have to pay for parking on top of the high admission fee.",

          "Went to see the Blarney  in Cork so my daughter visiting from Australia could kiss the Blarney stone myth has it when kissed you get the gift of the gab .Well worth the visit beautiful landscapes posting photos to view",
          "Beautiful all around the castle!",
          "Some much family fun.",
          "Beautiful castle and grounds, trails, nature paths, stone gardens, lore and mystery. It was so much more than I anticipated. Entry fee was very reasonable too. Staff was friendly. The climb to the top can be tricky but was not tiring because you move very slowly, a few steps at a time.",
          "I couldn't believe how much there is to do and see here. Many gardens, streams, Meadows and other things to explore. Even the castle has many rooms to see and is self-guided. So much more than just the Blarney Stone. Get there early to avoid a long line up into the castle.",
          "Plan ahead! The grounds are huge, including gardens, trails, sculptures, a manor, a castle, and water features. Definitely make a day of it, if you want to see everything.",
          "When you walk in go straight to the stone. Don\u2019t do anything else. Don\u2019t stop for food. Don\u2019t go to some garden. Go kiss the stone. The longer you wait the longer the line gets. Do you really want to wait 2 hours to kiss a rock? No. So get \u2026",
          "Highly recommend stopping here and exploring. Must kiss the Blarney Stone! Wished the Blarney home had been open though.",
          "What fun!!! We had a lovely time wandering the grounds and then going up the tower to kiss the stone. The line was rather long, but it was well worth it to hang over the edge.",
          "Kisses the Blarney Stone, could tell you all about it but I'd be talking blarney! \ud83d\ude1c",
          "Fun kissing the stone! Must-try!",
          "Nice castle but kissing the stone was not as exciting as it is amped up to be, especially for the price",
          "Very unique Castle and beautiful scenery and gardens surrounding the castle. Definitely a must visit on a trip to Ireland to kiss the stone.",
          "Lots of things to do and see. Signs everywhere so you don\u2019t get lost. Blarney Stone is the main attraction of course, but my favorite was the Poison Garden. Fall there is spectacular!",
          "The views from the top of the castle are really the gem of this location. Kissing the stone seems a touch unhygienic. Plan for at least an hour wait in line.",
          "Beautiful castle and gardens",
          "Very scary for me as I'm afraid of heights and a bit claustrophobic BUT the castle was BEAUTIFUL AND MY HUSBAND KISSED THE BLARNEY STONE!  MUST SEE PLACE FOR ANY IRELAND VISITOR!",
          "Legendary castle/stone. The surround grounds are absolutely beautiful.",
          "Beautiful Castle and Gardens!",

          "Beautiful historic place visit you must",

          "It was so nice if you like gardens as well",
          "The grounds are beautiful.  However the line to \"kiss\" the Blarney Stone was too long!",
          "Come for the stone. The grounds and castle are a worthwhile bonus",
          "Whenever family or friends coming over to visit me in Ireland I would always recommend to go and see Blarney castle. Not only is it a great experience to kiss the blarney stone and here all the stories around but it also great to spend some time in the massive and impressively maintained gardens.",
          "Much better than my expectations the grounds around the castle are stunning and very beautiful with lots of interesting themed areas. You could spend a day there if the weather is good. Kissing the blarney stone was scarey for me but did it! Would recommend a visit.",
          "Such a beautiful place and the history is great. Stayed for almost four hours and still didn't see all the spots on the property. Kissed the blarney Stone!!",
          "Amazing and beautiful grounds for a walk!",
          "Very interesting, beautiful but also a mystery place to find out. \ud83d\ude0e \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc4d",
          "It's beautiful.  I would come again and pack a lunch.",
          "As far as stones go this isn't too exciting, but the area around the castle- the rock close-up was absolutely wonderful on a warm sunny spring day. Plenty of land to wander about in and enjoy the sounds sights and smells. The castle is \u2026",
          "Brilliant day out. Highly recommended",
          "there is so much more than just the castle and stone, the gardens and walks are exceptionally beautiful and a delight to explore",
          "Not for the faint of heart this one. Once you have made the trek and queued to reach the stone... which can take up to 90 minutes... you will find two folks at the top of the castle. One who will take your picture and the other who will \u2026",
          "A great castle to explore and Beautiful grounds. Make sure to give yourself enough time to explore all the gardens.\nAnd make sure when you kiss the stone to put your head far enough down to reach the correct stone.",
          "Not for the faint hearted.  Lots of steps but it went slow and there were good rope or metal rails to hang on to.  I made it and have 1 total knee replacement and the other one is getting done in a couple months",
          "Fantastic!  So so beautiful! A must see if you are in the country!",
          "We enjoyed our visit. Beautiful setting and scenery.  We had a 90 minute queue for the blarney stone.\nPlenty of parking and facilities",
          "Lovely grounds and going up the steps to kiss the Blarney Stone was great. About 100 narrow steps to the top of the castle. Be prepared to lie down on your back and do a serious backbend to kiss the proper part of the stone. I enjoyed every minute of it.",
          "Amazing little castle with huge grounds and gardens. My wife and I took a day tour from Dublin out to Blarney castle. We spent about 3 hours at that spot alone and never left the grounds of the castle. If you enjoy gardens or just a nice \u2026",
          "You need to kiss the Blatney Stone they are very good on hanging on to you while you kiss it. Love the castle",
          "What a place. It is a must while being in Cork. The castle grounds have a cave, poison garden, stables, cafe etc while the castle is pretty much intact from the old ages. It has so many rooms, the smallest and the most steepest stairs, \u2026",
          "Wish I had more time to walk the grounds!! The castle is amazing and kissing the blarney stone is a once and a lifetime dream.",
          "Great exploring blarney Castle, approx an hr to get to the stone but worth it. The gardens and surroundings are so beautiful. You could spend a full day here.",
          "Staff was so nice. I am terrified of heights and the Blarney Stone holding guy gave me to confidence to bend and kiss the stone. I was completely pale and a little embarrassed, but it was worth it! \n\nI would go early because there's so much \u2026",
          "A fantastic place to explore. Take some time to see everything. It isn't a short visit type of place.",
          "Wonderful grounds and stunning views from the Castle",
          "Blarney Castle is stunning. The grounds are a treat in of themselves, and are full of stories to delight the young and old. Kissing the Blarney stone was fun but optional and you do have to bend over backwards, but it's quite safe. For \u2026",
          "Lovely castle... must visit",
          "It was very nice!  It will take about four to five hours to look at everything.",
          "A beautiful castle & gardens. Just awkward for those of limited mobility but you can't help that in a castle!",
          "We had a great time! Climbed the narrow stairs up to kiss the Blarney Stone, took lots of pics, and toured the gardens. The commanding view is worth it. No rush, tour at your pace. A very pleasant experience.",
          "The castle and stone was ok. Too much graffiti. Unfortunately, I was unable to reach the stone, and instead of accommodating me for a disability, they made me move on. Sad really. The garden made up for the disappointment, and we're more \u2026",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone is just a small portion of what is offered to see and venture into on the Grounds of Blarney. Soo many beautiful things to see, The Wishing Steps, The Seven Sisters, the flora and trees are just amazing. A must see in Ireland",
          "I only visited the gardens. Amazing! The fragrances.",
          "Beautiful grounds, lovely walk for all the family. Combines history and geography.",
          "Beautiful garden's and castle.If you kiss the Blarney Stone at the top of the castle it gives the power of better speech,called ''the gift of the gab in Irelandn.",
          "Long que to get to the top (if you want to kiss the stone) which is expected,  but no interaction whilst you wait. Expensive entry price and no guide book included. Have to pay for parking too.\nHowever,  the gardens are well kept and there is lots of grounds to explore if the weather is good.",
          "You know you have to do it! At least there are nice people and clean well maintained buildings waiting for you.",
          "Gorgeous castle and grounds! I witnessed a wedding photo shoot here and it was beautiful. The wait to the top to kiss the Blarney Stone took an hour. It was not worth it because I had no intention to kiss the stone because of hygienic \u2026",
          "Awesome! Kissed the stone and had a great time seeing the castle. Highly recommend.",
          "Of all of the castles that we visited in Ireland this was by far my favorite !!\nThe castle was very well maintained, the grounds and the gardens are absolutely beautiful ! Definitely a must see when in Ireland",
          "It was good. My feet hurt from all the walking. As you would imagine, there are a lot of tourists. A lot of Americans",
          "Blarney Castle, a stunning place and really a nice experience. I could have spent all day. The incredible narrow staircases made this visit to an adventure. We went to the top but didn't kiss the stone. I always wonder, how could this \u2026",
          "Fantastic view from the top of the tower. Steep stairs; not suitable for everybody. Beautiful grounds & walking paths.",
          "A must see. Be mindful of it's popularity.  We went early and everyone seemed to be moving along just fine.  Could see it being difficult if much busier.  Definitely worth the trip. We walked around the castle and immediate surrounding grounds for on an hour maybe two. Could easily spend a whole day wondering around. Much to see!",
          "Nerve wreaking trying to reach this thing while hanging from a height but great fun",
          "Well worth the money , amazing grounds to visit",
          "It was a funny experience. You climb ancient circular stone staircase for hslf an hour one step each few minutes and emerge on top of the tower. They hustle you through the actual \"kissing\" which involves laying down, holding on to a couple \u2026",
          "Top place to visit. Remember to bend right right right back and go very low or else you will only kiss the above the blarney stone stone wall. Oh and go to the loo as it takes time to climb. Super morbidly obese will struggle to climb as \u2026",
          "Great castle had a great day i had 6 vistors from the states in my taxi we all had a fab day",
          "If you go on a cruise tour to visit Blarney Castle, as soon as you get there on the bus head directly to the line to kiss the stone.  If not you will likely spend the rest of your time at the castle just waiting in line. If you are early to the line you will have time after the kiss to see the beautiful gardens.",
          "Very tight space to get to the top. View and the top is worth it. The guys at the top will assist anyone that wants to bend over backwards on the fourth story to kiss a stone. Seems safe enough. They will sell your picture to you at the entrance. Loved the gardens.",
          "Lovely place",
          "Absolutely stunning location. The line for the castle and the stone were one combined line which was a little disappointing since we just wanted to look at the castle. But the surrounding area was just gorgeous",
          "a staple of any visit to ireland however if you are larger in size or have sever claustrophobia i do not recommend trying to get to the blarney stone, its a very tight squeeze up the towers to the stone and even i with just my camera bag found it tight. those with mobility issues excercise extreme caution",
          "A lovely castle with fabulous views of the grounds. Beautiful gardens and paths with many natural features and legends. The steps to the top are fun to climb. You must get there as it opens to get to the top or you will wait in long lines \u2026",
          "Lovely gardens, check out the poison garden of the queue to the stone is too long. It\u2019s way more interesting anyway!",
          "Put this on your bucket list!! Kissing the Blarney Stone not only gives you eloquence, it will challenge your bravery to the n'th degree!! It's a must do and visiting Ireland without kissing the Blarney wouldn't be a complete journey.",
          "If you\u2019re in Ireland you have to make a journey to the Blarney Castle and kiss the Blarney Stone.  I love visiting places with stories of good luck behind them.  The trek up to the top took a while but was well worth the wait.  I also suggest walking down the wishing steps close by.",
          "Just go there it is truly a special place.",
          "Plan lots of time so you will not be rushed because there are so many things to see here.  What an experience! Hopefully you won't go on a rainy day because those steep Castle steps are very slippery. They clean the Blarney Stone with Sani wipes in between each person so they claim it's sanitary.",
          "Expensive but one can see why with well maintained grounds. Would need a full day to cover the grounds. Could do with site info in more languages. Well worth a visit.",
          "World class gardens",
          "Pretty castle, incredible grounds, less than friendly staff, and a very long line. Everything is centered around kissing the Blarney Stone. Worth a visit, but not sure it\u2019s worth \u20ac18/person!",
          "Worth the visit whether you kiss the stone or not. The castle is interesting, but the trip to the stone is a rigorous trip up a VERY NARROW spiral staircase.  The top of the castle is very high, providing a panoramic view of the area. Down \u2026",
          "Be prepared for the \"100 Stairs\" - but well worth it",
          "Loved the Castle and the grounds. Actually has a great slice of Pizza for Lunch.",
          "The thing I wasn't going to do on my first trip to Ireland was kiss that stone. After the lines of people and all the winding steps, what was the point of turning around? It turned out to be fun.",
          "It was awesome , walked up a long flight of stairs to be able to kiss the Blarney stone.  The area & grounds were just beautiful!!",
          "Fun experience. Certain people turn their noses up at this, but it's fun to do if the line isn't too long. We we about an hour before closing and waited about 45 minutes. Well worth it, for me anyway.",
          "Don't waste your time with the stone. The grounds are beautiful.",
          "The whole grounds is so cool. I totally recommend getting their early so you don't have to wait in a long line to go kiss the stone  but once you do that go explore the gardens, take a river walk, check out Blarney House. You can go under the castle and see the caves as well. There is so much to do there",
          "Best to visit when not too busy as the queue goes up a narrow spiral staircase before exiting onto roof level and round to the side where 2 staff help each person in turn to lay on their backs and manoeuvre into position to kiss the stone, \u2026",
          "This something you have to see if you come to Ireland, very well worth it.",
          "Also toured the Blarney home which was magnificent. The Castle and the kissing of the Blarney Stone was quite the wait. At times the queue was 1 hour to climb the narrow steep spiral steps to the top. The actual kissing of  the Stone was a \u2026",
          "Kissing the castle for Good speech! Walking forward and backward on wishing step! Great Garden! Beautiful View! 14 Euro for entrance~ I think it is quite good attraction!  ",
          "One of the most beautiful places I've visited. So much more than a castle.",
          "This castle! The castle to rule all castles! There a magical stone that give you powers here... To be very honest \u20ac18 (\u20ac14 if you can convince them you're a student) is a good price to pay for magical powers of you ask me. \n\nNow you may \u2026"

        "wiki": "Cobh ( KOHV, Irish: An C\u00f3bh), known from 1849 until 1920 as Queenstown, is a tourist seaport town on the south coast of County Cork, Ireland. Cobh is on the south side of Great Island in Cork Harbour and home to one of Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminals. Tourism in the area draws on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town. It was associated with the RMS Titanic, which was built in Belfast.\nFacing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. On a high point in the town stands the cathedral church of the diocese of Cloyne, St Colman's, which is one of the tallest buildings in Ireland.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe port, which has had several Irish language names, was first called \"Cove\" (\"The Cove of Cork\") in 1750. It was renamed by the British as \"Queenstown\" in 1849 to commemorate a visit by Queen Victoria. The name was changed to Cobh, during the Irish War of Independence, following the passing of a motion by the local administrative council on 2 July 1920. Cobh is a Gaelicisation of the English name Cove, and it shares the same pronunciation. It has no meaning in the Irish language.\nIn ancient times the area was known as Cuan an Neimheadh (the Harbour of Neimheidh), while Great Island was called Oile\u00e1n Ard Neimheidh (the high or important island of Neimheidh).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAccording to legend, one of the first colonists of Ireland was Neimheidh, who landed in Cork Harbour over 1,000 years BC. He and his followers were said to have been wiped out in a plague, but the Great Island was known in Irish as Oilean Ard Neimheadh because of its association with him.  Later it became known as Crich Liathain because of the powerful U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in kingdom, who ruled in the area from Late Antiquity into the early 13th century. The island subsequently became known as Oilean Mor An Barra (the Great Island of Barry & Barrymore), after the Barry family who inherited it.\n\nThe village on the island was known in English as Ballyvoloon, overlooking \"The Cove\". In 1743 the British built a fort, later to become known as Cove Fort, to the east of the village. The settlement was first referred to as Cove village in 1750 by Smith the historian who said: \"it was inhabited by seamen and revenue officials\". The Cork directory of 1787 shows about thirty businesses in the town, including one butcher and one draper. \nThe Water Club established at Haulbowline in 1720 was the progenitor of the present Royal Cork Yacht Club (RCYC, now based in Crosshaven) and is the oldest yacht club in the world. The RCYC was based for many years in Cobh and the present Sirius Arts Centre used to be a clubhouse of the RCYC organisation. In 1966, the RCYC merged with the Royal Munster Yacht Club, retaining the name of the RCYC but moving its headquarters to those of the RMYC at Crosshaven at the other side of the harbour.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nInternational upheaval led to Cobh undergoing rapid development in the early 19th century. Due to the natural protection of its harbour setting, the town became important as a tactical centre for naval military base purposes, never more so than at the time of the Napoleonic Wars . Today, the Irish Naval Service headquarters is on Haulbowline Island facing Cobh.\nThe wars against the French led to the town, then usually known as Ballyvoloon or The Cove of Cork, being developed as a British naval port assigned an admiral. Many of the present-day buildings date from this time of build up. George Brodrick, 5th Viscount Midleton engaged the English architect Decimus Burton to improve the streetscape and buildings during the 1840s. The eventual cessation of hostilities dented Cobh's prosperity for a while, but it soon became known as a health resort; many patients stayed here for their health because of the temperate climate. Amongst their number was Charles Wolfe, who wrote \"The Burial of Sir John Moore After Corunna\". Wolfe's body is buried in the Old Church Cemetery outside the town.\n\n\n=== RMS Titanic ===\n\nOne of the major transatlantic Irish ports, the town was the departure point for 2.5 million of the six million Irish people who emigrated to North America between 1848 and 1950. On 11 April 1912, as Queenstown, it was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic before she set out across the Atlantic on the last leg of her maiden voyage. She was assisted by the P.S. America and the P.S. Ireland, two ageing White Star Line tenders, along with several other smaller boats delivering first-class passengers' luggage. Some sources and local lore suggest that a Titanic crew member, John Coffey, a native of Queenstown, left the ship at this time, thereby saving his life. 123 passengers boarded at Queenstown, with only 44 surviving the sinking.\n\n\n=== Penal transportation ===\nCobh was earlier a major embarkation port for men, women and children who were deported to penal colonies such as Australia. The records of such deportations can be found in ships' log books in the Cobh Museum. Since 1973 it has been housed in Scots Church (a Presbyterian church until its 1969 closure), which overlooks the harbour where so many departed.\n\n\n=== Shipbuilding ===\nA significant shipbuilding industry was developed in the town. The remnants of the Verolme Shipyard today maintain many of the original cranes and hoists now forming part of an industrial and maritime heritage. \n\nThe age of steam brought Cobh association with several milestones, including the first steam ship to sail from Ireland to England (1821) and the first steam ship to cross the Atlantic (Sirius 1838), which sailed from Passage West. \nIn 1849, the name of the town was changed to Queenstown, to honour Queen Victoria who had visited Ireland during that year.\n\n\n=== RMS Lusitania and the First World War ===\nAnother ship to be associated with the town, the Cunard passenger liner RMS Lusitania, was sunk by a German U-boat off the Old Head of Kinsale while en route from the US to Liverpool on 7 May 1915. 1,198 passengers died, while 700 were rescued. The survivors and the dead alike were brought to Queenstown, and the bodies of over 100 who perished in the disaster lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery just north of the town. The Lusitania Peace Memorial is located in Casement Square, opposite the arched building housing the Cobh Library and Courthouse.\n\nDuring the First World War, Queenstown was a naval base for British and American destroyers operating against the U-boats that preyed upon Allied merchant shipping.  Q-ships (heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks) were called Q-ships precisely because many were, in fact, fitted-out in Queenstown.  The first division of American destroyers arrived in May 1917, and the sailors who served on those vessels were the first American servicemen to see combat duty in the war.  When that first convoy arrived in port after enduring a rough passage in what were little more than open boats, its members were met by a crowd of sailors and townspeople, thankful for their anticipated help towards stopping the U-boats that were blockading western Europe.  Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, commander of the Coast of Ireland station, met the senior American officer, Commander Joseph Taussig, at the dock and inquired as to how soon the weatherbeaten American ships could be put to use. \"We're ready now, sir!\" was the widely quoted answer from the American.\nThe United States Navy established U.S. Naval Air Station Queenstown in February 1918. It operated flying boats during the last months of WW1, and closed in April 1919.Due to its tactical military importance, under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, the port remained a UK sovereign base within the Irish Free State after 1922. Along with the other Treaty Ports, it was handed over to the government of the Irish Free State in 1938.\n\n\n== Economy and tourism ==\n\nTourism is a large employer in Cobh. Large cruise liners visit Cobh each year, mainly during the summer months, although many of the tourists are transported out of Cobh by bus to other tourist destinations. In all, almost 100,000 cruise liner passengers and crew arrive in the town each year when their ships berth right in the centre of the town at the Republic of Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminal. Tourist attractions are focused on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town and include the Queenstown Story at the Cobh Heritage Centre, Titanic Experience, Titanic Trail walking tour, Cobh Museum, Cobh Road Train, Spike Island tours and St Colman's Cathedral. The town has remained largely unchanged since RMS Titanic departed from Cork Harbour in 1912, with the streetscape and piers still much the same. Facing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. The latter is the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service, formerly a British naval base.\nCobh was home to Ireland's only steelworks, the former state-owned Irish Steel works which was closed by its buyer, Ispat International, in 2001. There is a controversy over the slag heap on the steelworks, where there are concerns that it may be leaching into the harbour. Another important employer in Cobh was the Dutch-owned Verolme Cork Dockyard, in Rushbrooke. It opened in 1960 but ceased operations in the mid-1980s. In 1981 the MV Leinster was built at Verolme for service on the Dublin \u2013 Holyhead route. The last ship built at Verolme was the Irish Naval Service's L\u00c9 Eithne (P31). Ship repair work is still carried at Rushbrooke using the drydock and slip way carriages. The drydock pumps date from 1912.In the 21st century, a number of new developments were completed, such as a new retail park at Ticknock in 2008, and a leisure centre (with 25m swimming pool) in August 2007. In 2010, tours of Spike Island commenced, with tours leaving from Kennedy Pier, near the town centre.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nOutside of the Dublin metropolitan area, Cobh is one of the few towns in Ireland served by a commuter train service. The town is one of two termini for Cork Commuter Services. The other is Midleton.  Regular commuter services run between Cork city and Cobh, calling at, among others, Fota railway station, Carrigaloe railway station, and Rushbrooke railway station, along the way. Trains run every day and the journey time to Cork is under 25 minutes.\nCobh railway station opened on 10 March 1862 and was closed for goods traffic on 3 November 1975.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe nearest airport is Cork Airport, which can be reached in 20\u201330 minutes from Cobh via the R624 road and the N25 road.\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port Operations Centre for Cork Harbour is located in the town. The port's harbour pilot launches are based at the Camber - a pier and dock are at the eastern end of the town.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nCurrently there is only a single road and road bridge that leads onto the Great Island. This road bridge, Belvelly Bridge, was built in 1803 at one of the narrowest points in the channels around Great Island.\n\n\n=== Cross River Ferry ===\nIn 1993 a Cross River Ferry was established which allowed cars and passengers to travel from Glenbrook near Monkstown to Carrigaloe on the Great Island.  The crossing from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe takes four minutes and runs daily. Reservations are not required.\n\n\n== Local government and politics ==\nWhile local administration was overseen by Cobh Town Council for some years, this local government body was abolished in 2014. Since then, the town has fallen within the area of responsibility of Cork County Council.

          "This tour is well worth booking. The history of the Titanic will live for a very long time and to walk in the footsteps of those who boarded the ship is in itself an experience. Lynn our guide throughout our tour was knowledgeable and informative. There were sad stories to be",

          "I thought this tour was very informative and I even learned something new. I never knew about the 7 people who got off at cobh and the photographs that were obtained thanks to one of these passengers . Lovely to see the original dock and the view from the balcony of the white",
          "We went expecting more of a historical museum with exhibits. Frankly, it was very, very corny. You get escorted through a very brief \"tour\" of their exhibits by a guide. You could walk through the four rooms from beginning to end in about 15 minutes or less. You get to watch",
          "We were excited about this guided tour, which was billed as immersive, and I knew that we would be assigned an identity. My expectations must have been way too high, because I associated it with the intense experience of being assigned an identity at the Holocaust Museum in",
          "It takes you back in time as if you are a real passenger boarding the Titatic and you get a replica of the original ticket with a persons name that really boarded the ship and later you find out what happened to that person. Loved every minute of it. Great photos and artifacts",
          "Went on a walking tour around Cobh with Frank Morrisy from the Titanic experience and as there was just my wife and myself it was very personal and a whole lot of fun. Frank's knowledge and stories were very interesting and he was full of interesting tidbits of information.",
          "Took a train from Cork to Cobh. Found the Titanic experience tour to be both fascinating and sad. To be able to stand in the same place as passengers waiting to board the Titanic was somewhat eerie. Our tour guide was fantastic. She was very personable and knowledgeable.",
          "We have been four times now - every time we are in town, we go. It is so fun and well done. Your entrance ticket has the identity of a passenger from the Titanic, along with their age, class, etc. At the end of the tour you get to find out if you lived or perished. Along the",
          "Excellent audio visual experience of boarding at Cobh, life at sea and abandoning the ship. The tour guide was superb with clear diction, very good information and she ensured that we moved at a good pace around the rooms.",
          "This was part of a walking tour that was offered by the Cruise Line we took... It's a short and small \"museum/display\" about the LAST STOP of the Titanic before it sank. The historical part of the presentation is very good",
          "We enjoyed having a person that we could follow the story and learn their fate at the end. It made it more personal. The guide was very good and it was great to see the rooms recreated as well as hear details of people on board. The original dock is still there and you can truly",
          "Very good guide - Matthew. Whole tour was very informative with good interaction with visual aids. The purser of the Titanic talking like you were there at the time of the Titanic's visit to Cobh",
          "Nicely presented view of the boarding of passengers of the 3 classes of travel and how they lived onboard, plus how many did not make it to dry land alive. The passenger name on your entry ticket shows the large element of luck that went into who survived or not.",
          "The tour was evidently over sold as the group did not fit into every room. Even when the group did fit in a room and were told to take a seat there were never enough seats. There was 22 people on our tour. The overall tour was good but did not get time to look at every room",
          "lovely interactive tour, poignant & steeped in history. Would thoroughly recommend it. Went with my son, both of us thought it was amazing and well-worth a visit.",
          "Of the several Titanic museums I have visited, this one has the fewest memorabilia, but it does present a touching account of some of the personal experiences and stories of some of the unfortunate (and fortunate) passengers. The entry fee is modest (around $12) and our guide",
          "The reason I have rated three stars is that I felt we were rushed through the exhibit. For instance our guide had already started presenting in the lifeboat room while half of us were still walking into the room. Also for the number of people going in each group they do need to",
          "There is no doubt the link between the last journey of the Titanic and the Titanic Experience in Cobh and if you are a Titanic buff then this is worth the visit. However if you are just a casual visitor you may feel rather short changed. The staff are very friendly and very",
          "The tour is very nicely presented making you feel like you were one of the passengers making that fateful voyage. It is about an hour in length and filled with information and exhibits. I would highly recommend that you allow time for taking in this experience...you will not",
          "We had a first hand experience of touring the titanic and experience the feeling of 121 passengers travelling from cobh to new York. It was very touching.",

          "We really enjoyed the Titanic Experience. The Staff were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The groups were small & any questions were answered and developed. Excellent!",
          "Very interesting and informative. My daughter was doing a project on the Titanic and the titanic experience was a great place to get information and photos for her. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful answering all her questions and even moving our tour slot as we were",
          "A great experience for all ages. Interesting and not too time consuming. Very enjoyable over all. The tour guide was excellent and very engaging.",
          "Very good tour. A few rooms to walk through and explore. Guided tour was 35 minutes long which held the children's attention enough. Each person was given a ticket with a person that actually boarded the Titanic in Cobh and you followed their story and found out whether you",
          "We returned to the experience after being here two years ago. The experience was even better. It is very interactive and educational.",

          "The Titanic Experience building is located in the heart of Cobh, on the waterfront. It's the actual building where passengers checked in on that fateful day. I first visited on 19th April 19. Entry fee, only \u20ac10.00. The tour lasted 1 hour. Our guide was a lady named Joanne & she",
          "This tour truly is very aptly named because it does give one the entire experience of the Titanic voyage from its last port of debarcation in Cobh (then known as Queenstown) to its tragic sinking in the Atlantic. Steerage areas and first class cabins are recreated. You are also",
          "It's a fairly small experience/museum however, it was thoroughly enjoyable and really interesting. The way they have set up the tour to make you feel a part of it is brilliant, you get given a ticket with a passengers name on it who would have boarded the ship from Cobh, you can",
          "Visited with my husband, having been to Halifax and seen all the graves of the unfortunate, seemed appropriate to visit the last place that people joined the ship. The tour guide Jeff was very good and knowledgeable. Good selection of artefacts from the Titanic. Reasonably priced",
          "We really enjoyed this experience and seeing all of the artifacts and information at the end of the experience.",
          "Thanks to Matthew, our tour guide, for spending some time at the end of the guided tour to answer my questions. I like his enthusiasm for the subject. I liked the idea of being a passenger taken on board of the Titanic. I liked when we sat in one of the lifeboats watching the",
          "We visited on the 11th April, which we were told that was the exact day that the Titanic left Cobh 107 years prior. We had a great tour from Lynn our guide that had me almost in tears. As you are given a person to follow, you really get involved and emotial. At the end of the",
          "Don't miss out on this if youre visiting Cork, it's worth it! A special mention to Joanne our tour guide, she was very friendly and made the tour extra enjoyable!

          "Good guided tour, lots of information delivered by a very nice lady. Lots of local information on local people who joined the Titanic in Cobh. Enjoyable tour.",
          "Interesting educational experience about the fateful trio of the RMS titanic. It\u2019s neat they assign you a passenger although I wish that part of the experience was a little more expansive. All in all, with the money, especially if the Titanic is of interest, historically",
          "We had about an hour to kill before our booked Spike Island trip and from a previous visit to Cobh many years ago had thought we were going to what I recall as the famine museum, however, we ended up at this relatively new Titanic museum experience. On the Easter Monday day of",
          "Must see attraction. Last port of call for the doomed oceanliner. Absolutely fantastic experience. Great mix of videos & real life exhibits. Tells the story well. You receive a \u201cticket\u201d w/ your purchase that has your name, age & class of passenger. Then you find out at the end",
          "This was a great way to see the impact of the loss in the community and to hear the real village history. The storyteller, Lynn, was very accommodating to all \u201cpassengers\u201d and shared the love of the waterfront community and how the vessel was part of it. This is a great way to",
          "So much effort has gone into this experience and it shows - really engaging and evocative. I'd highly recommend this tour to anyone in the area. Lynn was our tour guide and she even made an effort to engage our young kids to maximise their enjoyment of the experience.",
          "This is a well done small museum providing an informative walk through history! We enjoyed this experience and would recommend a stop at this location!",
          "We so enjoyed this tour. Felt a real connection to the folks who got on the Titanic at Cobh. We each received a card with info regarding a passenger. At the end of our tour we learned if the passenger lived or died. Exhibition after is informative. Please go!",
          "Got a tour today with our tour guide Lynn, she was very nice and made the your very enjoyable! Thanks",
          "We have been to three different Titanic museums this year, and this one is my favorite. They give you a ticket of a real passenger that boarded from Ireland. Our tour guide Lynn did a fantastic job telling the stories of the different passengers and what they experienced on the",

          "Today we visited the Titanic Experience with a 5, 8 and two 10 year olds. We all really enjoyed our tour and especially found that our tour guide Lynn was so friendly and informative. I would recommend the tour for all ages, young and not so young. There are interactive games",
          "Had a great visit to the Titanic Experience made even better by our guide Lynn who was friendly and informative. Situated in the old White Star lines ticket office, the tour really gives you the feel of being close to history.Well worth your time and money!",
          "This tour was set up to replicate the experience passengers had in 1912 even giving us cards with the names of actual passengers. We followed the route taken by passengers as they prepared to board the feeder ship. At the end of the tour we could check what fate awaited our",
          "We went on the 107th Anniversary of the last 123 passengers joining Titanic at Cobh or Queenstown as it was known then. Our guide Lynn was very knowledgeable and it was a very poignant. Lots to look at and very well organised and presented.",
          "The experience was incredible. For any Titanic nut, this is a must-see. I went on the 107th Anniversary of Titanic docking on Cobh (Queenstown) and our tour guide Joanne was wonderful. She was great to listen to, and she knew a lot about Titanic and the history surrounding her.",
          "We were there on the anniversary of the Titanic sailing. The staff/tour guides are really friendly and make the visit interesting for all guests, regardless of age. It was a great family visit.",
          "This is a quick museum, one to one and half hours at the most. It is set up very well and the tour guides are knowledgeable and entertaining.",
          "Don\u2019t miss this experience. You get assigned a passenger and you find out whether that passenger lived or died. My passenger had mental health issues after the experience (probably PTSD) and ended up dying in a sanatorium. Well done Tour. Also gave a lot of background to",
          "We scooted in for the last tour of the day, did not have reservations but they had space available for our party of 6. Our tickets described a passenger who departed from Cobh, and we were to find out our fate at the end of the tour. While waiting for the tour to start we spent",
          "This little exhibit is so well done! I had no idea when I added this stop to our itinerary that it was the actual White Star building that the passengers left from. Incredible history and parts of the story I didn't know beforehand. Well worth a visit!",
          "We were staying in nearby Fota resort and decided to do this tour with our 4.5 yr old. What can I say!! It was absolutely fantastic. Very good value for money. Our guide Lynn was brilliant. She was so knowledgeable and so enthusiastic that it was impossible not to get caught up",
          "We felt this was so well done. The guided part of the tour was more about the human stories, than the how and why the ship sunk and it really brought it to life. The guide was excellent and we learnt of some of the lucky survivors and factors that led others to a watery grave.",
          "This tour is just the right length for anyone with younger kids, not too long, and things to see and interact with. I thought it was very interesting that it is located in the Original White Star building, so you stand exactly where the last passengers boarding would have",
          "This tour is absolutely amazing! So full of information, really really enjoyed this tour. Went to see the titanic experience in Belfast and it honestly doesn\u2019t compare to this whatsoever! Our tour guide Jeff was also amazing and could answer any question with ease, one of the",
          "Luckily, we arrived just as a guided tour was about to start. We hardly had to wait at all. The experience is well thought through, and the exhibits and animations are all relevant. The highlight is probably sitting in a lifeboat and watching the ship go down. You get a",
          "Well, I was blown away by this little tour. What a fascinating insite into the lives of some of the passengers of RMS Titanic on that fateful night. A very somber, interesting and thought provoking look at an historical event, and I felt an affinity with one passenger in",

          "Our family really enjoyed this experience. It\u2019s very well done and really makes you feel like you are a passenger on the Titanic! Knowing we were in the exact place where the ship left from was quite moving. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "We were in Cobh so decided to visit, after some tales of locals who got off the ship the guide explained that the passengers left the ticket office from the now rotting pier to join the ship outside the harbour. The rest of the tour was farcical at best. A good earner for the",

          "Really enjoyed this exhibition and experience. Great for both kids and adults. They really connected us with the passengers that got on at Queenstown and it was amazing to be in the building they left for their doomed voyage. Red construction of 3rd and 1st class cabins were top",
          "The entire experience is wonderful. The staff is very knowledgeable and I like the way they give you a ticket with the name of an actual passenger. You get to go see through their eyes and see what it would have been to actually have been a passenger in the Titanic. I learned",
          "We visited this attraction whilst staying in Cobh. Very well run excellent staff and really informative. Well worth a visit.",
          "An interesting place to stop at if you are in Cobh. It is an updated version of the old ticket office where passengers would've boarded ships; most notably the Titanic. Inside the arrangement is set out quite nicely, there is an abundance of information to be learned, and the",
          "Interesting place where you get lot of information about Titanic. It is the original ticket office where the passengers from Ireland boarded the ship, which gives the whole place a very special feeling. The tour it self went very quickly - a bit too quickly - but still ok. At",
          "A lot of thought went into this tour and our guide Alison was very good giving an informative and interesting tour. It\u2019s not over loaded with facts and figures and doesn\u2019t become boring. Great idea that the entrance ticket is a boarding ticket with an actual original passengers",
          "I felt our visit and tour of the museum was very interesting and informative, especially for me. Growing up in a small East Texas town in the 50s & 60s, the sinking of the Titanic was something briefly covered in our history book, but there was not much emphasis placed on the",
          "Not much to see or do. A very short guided tour with some basic information about 127 folks who sailed from Cobh. After the tour you are left on your own to press a few buttons and read information from tv screens and a few posters and see a few artifacts that were not on the",
          "This is a must-do if you\u2019re a fan of the Titanic! It is located in the former ticketing office of the White Star line. The original pier where Titanic passengers left from is behind the building. As part of the experience, you\u2019re given the identity of a Titanic passenger.",
          "I am not one of these people who has any sentimentality toward the Titanic or the movie but it was raining hard and cold and we needed to kill some time waiting for the superb traditional music across the street to start so off we went. This turned out to be a very good",
          "I have been to the Vegas Titanic museum and the one in Halifax where the Titanic victims were taken and buried so it is fitting that I visit this site as well where the Titanic picked up passengers before setting sail. Very tragic and unsettling to be walking in the footsteps",
          "This is a must see. Great experience and you get totally invested in it. Everyone entering is \u201cassigned\u201d a person that went on the ship from Cobh and at the end of the tour, you find out if your person survived or not.",
          "The last place that Titanic docked before setting off across the Atlantic. Not the biggest museum ever but actually located in the building that all of the Irish passengers left from. Fabulously done and a different slant to the usual Titanic story. Well worth a visit.",
          "But it\u2019s small. About 45mins overall. Small tour of the offices for the White Star Line and artifacts and living history of the fateful voyage.",
          "This is a fantastic exhibition. I found the personal stories of the passengers fascinating and the presentation of their stories was superb. My grandparents travelled through Cobh, heading to New York many moons ago. I found being in this place very moving and the sympathetic",
          "We visited and discounted the tour as it was a waiting game and the kids were on half term, so really packed howevere we only had a limited timeframe",
          "I wasn't sure about this place because it is a big tourist destination, but we found it very absorbing and interesting, and not at all cheesy. My husband and I have Irish heritage and there was a lot of information available about immigration to the U.S. from Ireland, including",
          "Now this is the facility where 123 of the final Titanic passengers boarded two small tenders from the old dock in the picture and ferried to the anchored Titanic a few miles out. Story has it that the Titanic Captain decided to anchor out because it would save time in their",

          "Great place within walking distance of Cruise Ship terminal.",
          "A wonderful tour. Takes place in the white star lines ticket office in Cobh. The guided tour takes about half an hour and there is an interactive section afterwards. You would spend a maximum of one and a half hours doing the whole tour but it is well worth it. Very informative guides.",
          "Love this mini experience especially the postcard on entrance to follow a particular passengers journey do you survive? Wait till the end and it adds a bit of drama.",
          "Pretty great little museum with solid story telling and interesting bits of information. Having each guest receive a boarding card with the name, occupation and story of real passengers is a nice touch.",
          "We all know the faith of the Titanic and all the souls who lost their lives, it's a great experience.",
          "A small museum which manages to fit in a surprisingly large number of interesting displays. Hardly blaming them for wanting  to cash in on Titantic-mania, but it did feel a bit as if they were trying to take on a larger connection with the \u2026",
          "Fascinating ! Great records retained by locals and you'll learn new things even if you have already watched the film",
          "Great place for outing with lots of eating options and see water with music",

          "Great little museum and tour",
          "I do appreciate the effort to recreate the feeling of boarding the ship, original building, photos even tickets issued to visitors are Titanic tickets' like. Somehow I left this place with \"is that all?\" question in my head. Probably \u2026",
          "Nice tour a little depressing . Beautiful town to visit. Highly recommend",
          "Amazing ! You learn a lot about the Titanic. The guide tells you a lot while your watching films and tells you how the 1st and 2nd class people were treated differently to the low 3rd class. They give you a card with a name on it and you \u2026",
          "Must stop for a trip to Cobh! Different perspective to the story! Make time for the guided tour! Lynn was fantastic! The restaurant downstairs is great!!",
          "Was a fantastic experience that we didn't even know was tucked away. Availability was good but guided tour felt a little rushed with there being 1 every 15mins, didn't get to really view things properly and listen to the guide. Very \u2026",
          "Very interesting tour. What a beautiful village to visit.",
          "What a cool tour. We really enjoyed this one learned some things and a neat experience. At the end of the tour i found out that i perished in the sinking. Crsytal was one of the lucky ones that made it.",

          "Really enjoyed the idea of following around one passenger and learning in the end if they died or not.",
          "Expected a bit more out of this tour. The information and storytelling was very good. Some of the technology was a bit outdated though which minds took you out of it. I am not that big fan of Titanic but if you are I would recommend it. Don't expect too much though",
          "They have managed to make a human tragedy into an interesting, historic experience, where you learn about individual passengers. A very good museum for the whole family.",
          "Great place employees are real friendly and lots of info. Overall great experience",
          "If you are a enthusiastic off the Titanic,seen all the films and documentaries,then this is for you and it will not disappoint,you get a tour guide and a ticket with a person who boarded and you go into 6 rooms.The guide will ask if you \u2026",
          "Great place to visit lovely location friendly people",
          "Such a great experience. Shared the day with 2 of my daughters. Informative, very interesting and emotional. Making a connection with the passengers was done in such a clever and personal way. Loved it to bits, highly recommended.",
          "Kids enjoyed it a good mix of the various rooms on board  and story telling",
          "Very interesting insight into the titanic and specifically the passengers who boarded at Cobh",
          "It was a great day out I went to it for my birthday thermodynamics thing I'd fault is the price of the titanic items in the shop",
          "Fabulous place to visit. Filled with History from Titanic restaurant Titanic memorial garden. The Cathedral and restaurants and bars fill of Character and History. Very helpful and friendly staff and great atmosphere anywhere you go in Cobh \u2026",
          "Very enjoyable,  the tour guide took her time and was very informative,  accessibility was not a problem either even for a lady in a wheelchair.  Worth the money .",
          "Great tour, loved it. So did my 16 and 14 year old boys",
          "This is so interesting and cool!! A nice little experience in the adorable town of Cobh. Highly recommend doing this, even if you're just passing through",
          "Very interesting worth a visit.",
          "Loved visiting this museum!  Your ticket is an actual ticket for someone who had sailed on the Titanic and at the end if the tour you get to see if you had \"survived\".  Very moving tour to hear about and read about some of the survivors experiences.",
          "Interesting.",
          "On a cruise stop in Cobh we decided to go on the guided tour of \u2018The Titanic Experience\u2019 and quite the experience it was!\n\nIt is located in the original Star Line ticket office right by the very pier where passengers departed for their \u2026",

          "Great experience and a must do.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "It was fine. Kinda cheesy. There's a small museum and examples of the living quarters for 1st and 3rd class. Most of the tour is recorded on video though and the group is hearded through to each if the little movies that act as guides. You \u2026",
          "Tbh, I wasn't interested in learning more about the Titanic when visiting Ireland, but my friend wanted to go, so we did. The drive into Cobh from Cork was easy, and though the skinny, hilly streets were confusing to navigate, we found \u2026",
          "Very very good.\n\nAlthough small, the Titanic Experience is captivating, informative and engrossing.\n\nThe guide Lynn tells you all you need to know about the Titanic's departure from Cobh and the tragic collision and entertains you with small, interesting facts for you to share back home.\n\nA truly lovely experience.",
          "This was really great and very engaging for kids. Much better that Belfast experience!",
          "Amazing active history.  Exact location of ticket house. Balcony that 1st class passengers stood on and dock they set off from.",
          "Amazing! Loved this and was best to be in the same spot as the poor people who boarded that ship....",
          "Very informative! I learned several things during the tour. It's pretty amazing to stand where the parents of the Titanic stood before they boarded the ship.",
          "Amazing place one to visit definitely!! Wonderful place cork!!\ud83d\udcaf% \ud83d\udc95",
          "Well worth a visit",
          "Perfect for adults and young kids. My 8, five, and one year old  were efficiently entertained! We stayed about an hour. The first was a wonderful 30 minute tour that incorporated video, narration, and display. The last 30 minutes was self \u2026",

          "Interesting and thorough",
          "Well worth a visit. Very well done the story of the titanic .",
          "Great way to learn about the titanic and get a taste for local life",
          "Simply put, the Cobh Titanic experience was a joy. We brought our 11 and 13 year olds. Enough information to grasp the story and plenty of interactive exhibits to encourage further investigation. Truly short and sweet. The speed of the \u2026",
          "Kids loved it",
          "Yes it's not the biggest museum, yes it's not the longest guided tour but wow!!!! it doesn't need to be because you are actually in a piece of history, you are walking in the footsteps of those 123 passengers and if you look very \u2026",
          "Good tour and interesting information",
          "This was fabulous  , each  ticket ,bought  has a name of a passenger  you then do the tour which is fascinating  and at the end you look to see what happened to the person on your ticket .I found it quite emotional  but I'd recommend  it to anyone",
          "Great museum and very poignant following one of the passengers who joined Titanic at Queenstown",
          "Great place and the story that goes with it.",
          "I have been here a few times now. Happy to bring visitors here..A fantastic and sad experience. To get a passengers ticket at the door makes it interesting to see whether you have survived or not.  Great guides each time. Will be back again.",
          "Had no desire to visit, am glad I did.  Learn more than you wanted about the Titanic and emigration to the US in general.  The \"fun\" part was to be assigned a name of a passenger and to learn of their fate at the end.    Town was cute, nothing special.  Worth a stop but don't plan on a whole day.",
          "Irish heritage so this was very interesting.",
          "Well worth a visit. Last visited about 10 years  ago, changed a good bit since then. Good experience.",
          "Fantastic guide took our party through the exhibition telling all the history and family life before before they boarded the ship to New York.",
          "Tour guide was very knowledgeable and well spoken. Loved how they made it Ireland specific.",
          "\u00c0 very well planned out exhibit. You can select a passenger name from the list and see if he or she survived or...........",
          "Awesome and so very interesting.",
          "A fun litt tour that gives some fun inside details. Worth your time and the price os not all that bad.",
          "Very distracted Staff,  they rather chat than serve.",
          "A very nicely done tour--and a pretty little town. We enjoyed this.",
          "Well laid out, informative and knowledgeable guide. Bit tight for mobilty scooter, but well looked after by staff.",
          "Loved this place. Extremely interesting. Learned a lot re irish history as well as about titanic",
          "Good place to visit lots of great interest about the history of cobh",
          "Really friendly staff, the audio visual parts were played in Spanish as all of our group spoke Spanish which was great. The facts of the voyage were well explained and the tour length was fine. Only downside would be price to length ratio. It seemed a small bit expensive for what was offered. The rest excellent.",
          "An amazing experience for tourists. A must if you're staying in cork",
          "Very well organised timed  visit. Guides knowledge excellent. Tickets given have a name of an actual passenger that sailed on the Titanic , only at the end do you find out if that person survived. Lots of information boards and listening stations.",
          "A great experience - really helps you connect to those who boarded that fateful ship at Cobh/Queensferry.",
          "Nice place, very interesting \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "You get a boarding pass of a person that got on the Titanic in Cobh (Queenstown was the town name then).  It was very interesting to hear of the passengers that got off in Queenstown.  We liked to see the difference between the 3rd class bunk and the first class suite.",
          "Great tour. The tour guide Lynn was superb. Highly recommended.",
          "Nice experience seeing where people boarded for titanic. But its always sad what next happened after.",
          "On a nice day it was lovely to walk around kids really enjoyed it if I could be a little critical lots of doo doo on the ground",
          "Best place for tourists to learn about our towns history",
          "4 stars because it was small, but the guides were just lovely,  the whole area very nice.  Worth the drive for sure.",
          "Surprisingly well done museum and tour. I learned quite a bit, which surprised me. Queenstown is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of the fateful ship's journey.",
          "Nice experience. For my taste little bit poorly. Two room's to see, few interactive videos and in the end like \"self guided\" exhibition. Price 9 euro. Could be little bit more. Staff is friendy they should speak little bit slower just that people can understand.",
          "Was super fun. It was cool to get to the end and see if your ticket holder survived or not. Heart breaking and informative",
          "The whole experience was very well done you are given your own ticket for the Titanic with a passengers name who boarded at Cobh all those years ago. At the end of the tour you can look up your passenger and see there fate on board the \u2026",

          "Very  informative  and we'll presented could  have spent longer will return again",
          "Put a photo of sal vulcano on the tablets",
          "If you are a fan of Titanic trivia its worth the walk and tour. Nice gift shoppe' also has some Guinness items and nice selection of books reference the Titanic.",
          "Lovely place to visit with a nice tour and all guided by friendly staff.",
          "Gave more history of titanic and the entrance tickets has a name of a person that you would have been. Good souvenir",
          "Hants down worst experience of my life. Any person  that has no compassion for an 88 year old woman is vile\nWe arrived was told that is was closed due to an incident earlier by a  very rude girl\nWas then told come back in an hour , arrived \u2026",
          "Compact but interesting museum relating the Titanic to Cobh.",
          "Fascinating, I did not survive my titanic adventure",
          "Well informed guide who made our visit very interesting and moving.",
          "Brought all the feels when you get to the Titanic Memorial Park. Houses along side the route to the park are adorable. No real shopping though.",

          "Simple yet very memorable. Thoughtfully done. Last port Titanic sailed.",
          "Really interested in the story of Titanic, so a lot of info I already knew. Nicely laid out and the tour flowed well. Tour guide did really well but I did spot some incorrect details being told. I.E: telling us today (14th April) is the \u2026",

          "Really enjoyed this experience, the tour guide was fantastic and very knowledgeable, highly recommended",
          "This place was fun and informative. Book ahead to secure a tour time.",
          "Highly recommend. Very interesting tour and only \u20ac9pp. The guide was engaging and spoke very clearly",
          "What a great way to construct a learning experience! They have you participate as of you were a passenger signed up to sail with the Titanic! It's a great experience for all ages with a lot of cool facts I never knew about before presented in an engaging manor. Don't miss it if you're in the area!",
          "Sometimes a little too real, but very moving. Lots of info. Staff knowledgeable & helps to make it very personal.",
          "It's a must if you're visiting Cobh!",
          "Really interesting tour. Great for all ages.",
          "10 Euro per adult. Great guide included. Awesome experience.",
          "As we love history we enjoyed it tremendously. The presentation was done very well and the exhibition was excellent. Worth a visit when you're in Cobh!",
          "Very cool and interactive! You get a card with information about someone who boarded the titanic, and go throughout the experience as if you were that person (including learning if they survived or not). Great fun for people of all ages",
          "Very interesting. Given a card on entry with a passenger's name. Found out more about them at the end.",
          "Not very accurate on technical aspects: \n\nTitanic never tried to set a new record for crossing - it was slower than the champion at that time (either Lusitania or Mauretania)\n\nTitanic was not the first White Star liner going for luxury, \u2026",
          "The tour is interesting but very short. The tour guide was knowledgeable and clearly enjoyed her work. There are some good interactive displays but overall I wouldn't make a second visit. A little costly for what you get.",
          "Eye opener. Very informative.",
          "Good and informative. Pleasant stroll through no rushing.",
          "Wouldn't really recommend it. A few interesting stories but not worth the price. Make sure you are toward the heard of guided tour group, because the tail won't get a chance to see what's being explained. You may learn more at the exhibition after the tour, which still lacks the content as well.",
          "Well worth the visit. So much information",
          "The ship  experience was brilliant",
          "An excellent venue for understanding where the Titanic's passengers embarked from for their fateful voyage.",
          "Very good exhibition and they really packed in a lot more than I thought possible from the size of the building from the outside. Very nice touch that it's the original White Star Line ticket office and while it's a shame the original pier \u2026",
          "Tour was really informative, good interactive visuals. The exhibition is in the White Star building the passengers left from so is a link to the history. Well worth a visit",
          "Amazing such great info....",
          "An amazing exhibition. This is about the construction of, the people involved in that and how it affected life in Belfast. I loved this side of the story. The building is beautiful but doesn't flie as well as it could. I felt as though I wanted to represent it better for them. The docents were friendly and helpful.\nA good tour choice.",
          "Please don't cook up stories",
          "An interesting concept reasonably executed. The highlight remains the infamous pier and associated White Star ticket office buildings but the exhibit is worthwhile, if a little bit bland and unimaginative. The history of the Titanic is fascinating and this museum goes some way to doing it justice.",
          "The guide was enthusiastic and well informed. The girl on the ticket desk was very helpful. Interesting tour but not overly engaging for children.",
          "It was good but short, some very good and interesting information.",

          "I have the feeling I got fooled.\n10\u20ac p.p for half an hour of visit. Like you HAVE TO bring money, as much as possible.\nFor a museum I find it amazingly sad..\nAnd you learn more by just watching the movie.",

          "Good value for money, guided too was good. Historical value building.",
          "The Titanic Experience was very informative. The best part is when you purchase a ticket you are given a real person who was on board the Titanic and at the end of the guided tour you get to see if you survived or if you didn't make it. The \u2026",
          "Very informative, tour guide Hannah was very knowledgeable.",
          "Been to Cobh dozens of times but never did the Titanic  experience until last week. I am so glad we did,  so informative and really does bring you back as if you were there.  The kids thoroughly  enjoyed it too.  Definitely worth a visit. ",
          "Irish hospitality? Yeh right!\nAbsolutely rude staff, bad communication and no understanding or sympathy whatsoever of how to treat a visitor to the area.\nThere was no warm welcome, just attitude as soon as I walked up to the counter.\nThanks \u2026",
          "Very interesting tour that lasted about 30 minutes. Located in the old White Star ticket office. This tour gives you how passengers experienced Titanic. There is not much in the way of artifacts from Titanic if that is what you would like \u2026",

          "Very informative, well set out and really good value",
          "Overall the tour was great! I like how it was both based of history and interactive. The only issue was the tour I did had about 25 people and it was packed! I am glad the guide had a speaker but on some of the areas we had to wait around the corner because there was no room. \nOverall. Glad I did it.",
          "Short but very informative. Lots to read about every aspect of Titanic. Price was reasonable, staff lovely and helpful. The shop was well stocked and not over priced. Highly recommend taking an hour out to visit this exceptional part of history.",
          "As interesting a visit as is the history surrounding it.",
          "Small and rushed visit. No titanic artefacts , heritage center covers this and much, much more for the same money.",
          "A moving exp\u00e9rience but not too traumatic",

          "Very interesting experience, the gift shop at the end of the tour can be expensive.",
          "The museum collection and the whole information are worth it but they don't give anything special from what we already know about the Titanic history. \nBut the visit is a plus as we can see the real spot where the travelers started the tragic trip.",
          "Fabulous experience. A wonderful recreation of the harsh working conditions of a bygone era....",
          "This tour took about an hour and was very interactive. The kids enjoyed and it was historic for an adult to stand in the building where the passengers bought their tickets and waited to cross the Atlantic.",

          "Tour guides full of knowledge, lots of information you wouldn't know was learnt and good exhibits",
          "Decent irish daily menu is served here. Lovely family runned athmosphere and delicious irish coffee was consumed here \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Only did the exhibits.  Could not do the tour because we had our 14 month old son.  It would have been too much for him,  due to January weather and the length of time the tour takes.  So my rating is only for the exhibits.  Nice exhibition \u2026",
          "A great experience of how the titanic would have looked back then. Great in depth knowledge given about the history. I had a 10 yr old with me that really enjoyed his visit ",

          "better than belfast we thought",
          "Great tour. Knowledgeable guide",
          "We were really impressed by the short time in this experience. The first half an hour we were on a guided tour with a very good guide taking us to the dock where the last bunch of unlucky passengers boarded the Titanic before its fateful \u2026",
          "Brilliant, interesting exhibition and interactive presentation, with each guest following the life of a victim or survivor of the disaster. \nHost presenter Lynn provided a knowledgeable and clear commentary \nGreat value for a unique exhibition \ud83d\udc4d",

          "so much fascinating history",
          "What a lovely day we had in Cobh",
          "Very good tour, well run , all staff are very friendly and helpful. Nice touch was that we all got replica tickets with names of real passengers on them and at the end of the tour we got to see if they survived or not...kids loved it.",
          "Great addition to the town since it has opened. staff are well trained in the subject and are friendly and polite",
          "Nice but small. Every visitor gets one Irish passenger name and at the exit check's his/her destiny. Restaurant is nice with good food. Typical Irish, burger and fish&chips.",

          "Very informative",
          "Great keeper of history.",
          "A lot of interesting info about last port of Titanic.",
          "Tour was okay, not particularly worth the 9 Euro entry fee. The tour was 30 minutes of a guided/audio tour, kind of a weird flow actually. Then there was a self guided section at the end, we only spent 15-20 min in there, nothing \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit. Excellent.",
          "Interesting ,acoustics not great and therefore hard to hear muffled tour guide",
          "Interesting insight on the Titanic? At the rear of the venue you will find the tinmber remains of the original dock from where passengers set off.",
          "Just do it feel the moment it went down yup that's how it is served here humor sadness appalling greedniess and sacrifice",
          "Tourist trap. Nothing but short videos, they shuffle you from room to room. The only interesting thing is the pier which is original, but you can see that on the deck of the attached restaurant.",
          "Very informative and emotional exhibition. Though the tour is relatively short, there is a lot of reading material, and some fun parts for kids, like sniffing areas of the ship",

          "Amazing 1 hour experience overall. Our tour guide Jeffery was outstanding!",
          "Cobh is an amazing town with loads of history. Unfortunately, I expected much more in Titanic experience or in the restaurant. I can see a lot of potential in that specific building, but the experience is not that great and the food for the price is just fine.",
          "Nice little town",
          "This could be really cool. However, it wasn't. It felt really rushed and this was no fault of the tour guide. I believe it's just the system they have in place. I actually saw and learned a lot more after the guided tour just by reading all of the information on the walls. With a few tweaks this could be a really cool experience.",
          "The ship's last stopover on its way to NYC and a few interesting pictures",

          "Went to this on Easter Sunday is a great way of giving away \u20ac23 , I felt that they could do so much more with this attraction maybe add in a 360\u2019 visual experience the audience needs to be stimulated, that said I did leave with more knowledge than when I went in",
          "Good setup. And a interesting part of titanic history too",

          "My daughter LOVED it she said it's better than Belfast as it's more personal rather than industrial",
          "Excellent museum. Very interesting to find out about the people. Parts are a bit upsetting.",
          "The exhibition is in 2 parts.\nFirst : boarding the Titanic, we see a third class cabin and a 1st class. We are witnessing the shipwreck as in a lifeboat. \nSecond part : the different reasons of the wreck (not enough lifeboat, no binoculars, \u2026",
          "Hmmmm\nWell what can I say. Bit of a let down. Mock up rooms and you will need plenty of imagination !",
          "It has been refurbished and lost a  bit of its character,  food stops running at5pm on a weekend and that's relevant for tourist, nice people, but not so good service",

          "Vary good. We'll worth a visit. Good tore.",
          "Very good museum. In a nice place . i recommend cobh",
          "To be honest, it's only about average as far as tours go. It's rushed,the tour guide wasn't very informed, the exhibition space is tiny. While it has massive potential, there seems to be alot lacking in developing that potential. It all seems a bit glib and doesn't pay true respects to those who died.",
          "A very interesting look at the tragic events of this great ship,well presented and worth every penny.",
          "This an amazing place, full of history! Loved it from the minute we walked in, you actually feel like you were on the Titanic! Great atmosphere & the staff are friendly & helpful, would definitely return!",

          "A great reconstruction of some Titanic's rooms and a very interesting visit about history and curiosities of the ship. It was nice. I like you receive a ticket with a name of a real passenger at the beginning of the visit; at the end you can know if your passenger has survived or not ",

          "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.",
          "Cool exibits but small and doesn't take long to get through. I like that you get a real passenger and are able too we if they lived or died at the end. Exhubts include tech that was cool but I expected to do more with pretending we were in the Titanic. Nice gufy shop but pricey.",
          "Service dreadfully poor. Management apathy to feedback was a surprise. Waiting almost 20 mins for a Bailey's coffee was a new low and i had to ask 3 times for it. Food when it eventually arrived was good but the full order didn't arrive. \u2026",

        "wiki": "Blarney Castle (Irish: Caisle\u00e1n na Blarnan) is a medieval stronghold in Blarney, near Cork, Ireland. Though earlier fortifications were built on the same spot, the current keep was built by the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, a cadet branch of the Kings of Desmond, and dates from 1446. The Blarney Stone is among the machicolations of the castle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe castle originally dates from before 1200, when a timber house was believed to have been built on the site, although no evidence remains of this. Around 1210 this was replaced by a stone fortification. It was destroyed in 1446 but subsequently rebuilt by Cormac L\u00e1idir MacCarthy, Lord of Muscry, who also built castles at Kilcrea and Carrignamuck.The castle was besieged during the Irish Confederate Wars and was seized in 1646 by Parliamentarian forces under Lord Broghill. However, after the Restoration, the castle was restored to Donough MacCarty, who was made 1st Earl of Clancarty.During the Williamite War in Ireland in the 1690s, the 4th Earl of Clancarty (also named Donough MacCarty) was captured, and his lands (including Blarney Castle) were confiscated by the Williamites.\nThe castle was sold and changed hands several times \u2014 Sir Richard Pyne, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, owned it briefly \u2014 before being purchased in the early 16th century by Sir James St John Jefferyes, governor of Cork City.Members of the Jefferyes family built a mansion near the keep. This house was destroyed by fire, and in 1874 a replacement Scottish baronial-style mansion, known as Blarney House, was built overlooking the nearby lake. In the mid 19th century, the Jefferyes and Colthurst families were joined by marriage, and the Colthurst family still occupies the demesne. In May 2008, the present estate owner, Sir Charles St John Colthurst, Baronet, succeeded in a court action to eject a man who had lived on his land for 44 years. The man's great-grandfather had been the first to occupy the estate cottage.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe castle is now a partial ruin with some accessible rooms and battlements. At the top of the castle lies the Stone of Eloquence, better known as the Blarney Stone. Tourists visiting Blarney Castle may hang upside-down over a sheer drop to kiss the stone, which is said to give the gift of eloquence. There are many versions of the origin of the stone, including a claim that it was the Lia F\u00e1il \u2014 a numinous stone upon which Irish kings were crowned.\nSurrounding the castle are extensive gardens. There are paths touring the grounds with signs pointing out the various attractions such as several natural rock formations with fanciful names such as Druid's Circle, Witch's Cave and the Wishing Steps. The grounds include a poison garden with numerous poisonous plants, including wolfsbane, mandrake, ricin and opium, as well as cannabis. Blarney House is also open to the public.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Blarney Castle Website",

        "wiki": "Cork (; Irish: Corcaigh, pronounced [\u02c8ko\u027ek\u026a\u025f], from corcach, meaning \"marsh\") is the second largest city in Ireland, located in the south-west of Ireland, in the province of Munster. Following an extension to the city's boundary in 2019, its population is c. 210,000.The city centre is an island positioned between two channels of the River Lee which meet downstream at the eastern end of the city centre, where the quays and docks along the river lead outwards towards Lough Mahon and Cork Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world.Originally a monastic settlement, Cork was expanded by Viking invaders around 915. Its charter was granted by Prince John in 1185. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can be found around South and North Main streets. The third largest city by population on the island of Ireland, the city's cognomen of \"the rebel city\" originates in its support for the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the Roses. Corkonians sometimes refer to the city as \"the real capital\", a reference to its opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the Irish Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Cork became (more) urbanised some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.\n\nThe city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted \"Black Rent\" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork. Together, these baronies are located between the Barony of Barrymore to the east, Muskerry East to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.\n\nThe city's municipal government was dominated by about 12\u201315 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe \u2013 in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.\nThe medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.\nThe title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent mayor by Queen Victoria on her visit to the city.Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly Irish nationalist city, with widespread support for Irish Home Rule and the Irish Parliamentary Party, but from 1910 stood firmly behind William O'Brien's dissident All-for-Ireland Party. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the Cork Free Press. Cork was overtaken by Belfast as Ireland's second largest city in the nineteenth-century.\nIn the War of Independence, the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British Black and Tans, in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\" and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the Irish Civil War, Cork was for a time held by anti-Treaty forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty National Army in an attack from the sea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Cork, like the vast majority of Ireland, is mild oceanic (Cfb in the Koeppen climate classification) and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b. Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city centre. The airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the rest of the city. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill. Due to its position on the coast, Cork city is subject to occasional flooding.Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) or above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) are rare. Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres (48.34 in) of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 \"rainy\" days a year (over 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with \"heavy rain\" (over 5 millimetres (0.20 in)). Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no \"recordable sunshine\", mostly during and around winter.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design provide a throughput of new blood, as do the active theatre components of several courses at University College Cork (UCC). Important elements in the cultural life of the city are: Corcadorca Theatre Company, of which Cillian Murphy was a troupe member prior to Hollywood fame; the Institute for Choreography and Dance, a national contemporary dance resource; the Triskel Arts Centre (capacity c.90), which includes the Triskel Christchurch independent cinema; dance venue the Firkin Crane (capacity c.240); the Cork Academy of Dramatic Art (CADA) and Graffiti Theatre Company; and the Cork Jazz Festival, Cork Film Festival and Live at the Marquee events. The Everyman Palace Theatre (capacity c.650) and the Granary Theatre (capacity c.150) both host plays throughout the year.\nCork is home to the RT\u00c9 Vanbrugh Quartet, and popular rock musicians and bands including John Spillane, Rory Gallagher, Five Go Down to the Sea?, Microdisney, The Frank and Walters, Sultans of Ping, Simple Kid, Fred and Mick Flannery. The opera singers Cara O'Sullivan, Mary Hegarty, Brendan Collins, and Sam McElroy are also Cork born.\nRanging in capacity from 50 to 1,000, the main music venues in the city are the Cork Opera House (capacity c.1000), The Everyman, Cyprus Avenue, Dali, Triskel Christchurch, The Roundy, and Coughlan's.\n\nThe city's literary community centres on the Munster Literature Centre and the Triskel Arts Centre. The short story writers Frank O'Connor and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in hailed from Cork, and contemporary writers include Thomas McCarthy, Gerry Murphy, and novelist and poet William Wall.\nAdditions to the arts infrastructure include modern additions to the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery and renovations to the Cork Opera House in the early 21st century. The Lewis Glucksman Gallery opened in the Autumn of 2004 at UCC, was nominated for the Stirling Prize in the United Kingdom, and the building of a new \u20ac60 million School of Music was completed in September 2007.\nCork was the European Capital of Culture for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the Lonely Planet's top 10 \"Best in Travel 2010\". The guide described Cork as being \"at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse\".There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between Manchester and London, Melbourne and Sydney or Barcelona and Madrid. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves as \"The Rebels\"; the county is known as the Rebel County. This view sometimes manifests itself in humorous references to the Real Capital and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating The People's Republic of Cork.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nThe city has many local traditions in food, including crubeens, tripe and drisheen, which were historically served in eating houses like that run by Katty Barry in the mid-20th century. The English Market sells locally produced foods, including fresh fish, meats, fruit and vegetables, eggs and artisan cheeses and breads. During certain city festivals, food stalls are also sometimes erected on city streets such as St. Patrick's Street or Grand Parade.\n\n\n=== Accent ===\nThe Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of Hiberno-English, displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard Hiberno-English, some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad. The Cork accent displays varying degrees of rhoticity, usually indicative of the speaker's local community.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\n\nBroadcasting companies based in Cork include RT\u00c9 Cork, which has a radio, television and production unit on Father Matthew Street in the city centre. Communicorp Media opened a radio studio in 2019 in the city covering content on both Today FM and Newstalk. Virgin Media Television also has an office in the city which covers local news stories developing within the city and county.The city's FM radio band features RT\u00c9 Radio 1, RT\u00c9 2fm, RT\u00c9 lyric fm, RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta, Today FM, Classic Hits, Newstalk and the religious station Spirit Radio. There are also local stations such as Cork's 96FM, Cork's Red FM, C103, CUH 102.0FM, UCC 98.3FM (formerly Cork Campus Radio 97.4fm) and Christian radio station Life 93.1FM. Cork also has a temporary licensed citywide community station 'Cork FM Community Radio' on 100.5FM, which is on-air on Saturdays and Sundays only. Cork has also been home to pirate radio stations, including South Coast Radio and ERI in the 1980s. Today some small pirates stations remain.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCork is home to one of Ireland's main national newspapers, the Irish Examiner (formerly the Cork Examiner). Its 'sister paper', The Echo (formerly the Evening Echo), was for decades connected to the \"Echo boys\", who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in parts of the city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent. The city's university publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nCork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods. The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the Red Abbey. There are two cathedrals in the city; St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the Catholic cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Church of Ireland (Anglican) and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect William Burges.\nSt. Patrick's Street, the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. At its northern end is a landmark statue of Father Mathew. The reason for its curved shape is that it was originally a channel of the River Lee which was built over on arches. The General Post Office, with its limestone fa\u00e7ade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal  which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.\nThe Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions. The old financial centre is the South Mall, with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century, such as the Allied Irish Bank's which was once an exchange.\n\nMany of the city's buildings are in the Georgian style, although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures, such as County Hall tower, which was, at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building: The Elysian. Outside the County Hall is the landmark sculpture of two men, known locally as 'Cha and Miah'. Across the river from County Hall is Ireland's longest building; built in Victorian times, Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital has now been partially renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall, after its architect William Atkins.Cork's most famous building is the church tower of Shandon, which dominates the North side of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon. Another site in Shandon is Skiddy's Almshouse, which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to the poorest of the city.\nCork City Hall, another notable building of limestone, replaced the previous one which was destroyed by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\". The cost of this new building was provided by the UK Government in the 1930s as a gesture of reconciliation.\n\nOther notable places include Elizabeth Fort, the Cork Opera House, Christ Church on South Main Street (now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church), and St Mary's Dominican Church on Popes Quay. Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of University College Cork, through which the River Lee flows, the Women's Gaol at Sunday's Well (now a heritage centre) and the English Market. This covered market traces its origins back to 1610, and the present building dates from 1786.Parks and amenity spaces include Fitzgerald's Park to the west of the city (which contains the Cork Public Museum), the angling lake known as The Lough, Bishop Lucey Park (which is centrally located and contains a portion of the old city wall) and the Marina and Atlantic Pond (an avenue and amenity near Blackrock used by joggers, runners and rowing clubs).Up until April 2009, there were also two large commercial breweries in the city. The Beamish and Crawford on South Main Street closed in April 2009 and transferred production to the Murphy's brewery in Lady's Well. This brewery also produces Heineken for the Irish market. There is also the Franciscan Well brewery, which started as an independent brewery in 1998 but has since been acquired by Coors.\n\n\n== Local government and politics ==\n\nWith a population of approximately 210,000, Cork is the second-most populous city in the State and the 16th-most populous area of local government. Per the Local Government Act 2001, Cork City Council is a tier-1 entity of local government with the same status in law as a county council.\nWhile local government in Ireland has limited powers in comparison with other countries, the council has responsibility for planning, roads, sanitation, libraries, street lighting, parks, and a number of other important functions. Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral areas. As of the 2019 Cork City Council election, the council's members are affiliated to the following political parties: Fianna F\u00e1il (8 members), Fine Gael (7 members), Green Party (4 members), Sinn F\u00e9in (4 members), Labour (1 member), Solidarity\u2013People Before Profit (1 member), Workers' Party (1 member), Independents (5 members). Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the South-West Regional Authority. A new Lord Mayor of Cork is chosen in a vote by the elected members of the council under a D'Hondt system count. Since June 2020, the mayor has been Joe Kavanagh of Fine Gael.Cork City Hall is located along Albert Quay on the south side of the city. It officially opened on 8 September 1936, following the previous building being destroyed in the \"Burning of Cork\" in 1920. The administrative offices for Cork County Council are also located within the city limits, on the Carrigrohane Road on the west side of the city.For the purposes of elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the city is part of two constituencies: Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central which each returns four TDs. Following the 2016 general election, these constituencies together returned two TDs for the Fine Gael party, three for Fianna F\u00e1il, two for Sinn F\u00e9in and one for the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit.\nIn 2018, cabinet approval was given for an extension of the Cork City Council boundary, to include Cork Airport, Douglas, Ballincollig and other surrounding areas. This extension was completed in mid-2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nThe retail trade in Cork city includes a mix of modern shopping centres and family owned local shops. Shopping centres can be found in several of Cork's suburbs, including Blackpool, Ballincollig, Douglas, Ballyvolane, Wilton and at Mahon Point Shopping Centre.\n\nOther shopping arcades are in the city centre, including the \"Cornmarket Centre\" on Cornmarket Street, \"Merchant's Quay Shopping Centre\" on Merchant's Quay, home to Debenhams, Dunnes Stores and Marks & Spencer, and a retail street called Opera Lane off St. Patrick's Street/Academy Street. A mixed retail and office development, on the site of the former Capitol Cineplex, with approximately 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) of retail space, was opened in June 2017. Retail tenants in this development include Facebook, AlienVault and Huawei.Cork's main shopping street is St. Patrick's Street and is the most expensive street in the country per sq. metre after Dublin's Grafton Street. The area was impacted by the post-2008 downturn, though retail growth has increased since, with Penneys announcing expansion plans in 2015, redesigning of some facades on the street, and opening of newer outlets, including Superdry in 2015. Other shopping areas in the city centre include Oliver Plunkett St. and Grand Parade. Cork is home to some of the country's leading department stores with the foundations of shops such as Dunnes Stores and the former Roches Stores being laid in the city.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nCork City is a hub of industry in the region. Several pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in the area, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Swiss company Novartis. Perhaps the most famous product of the Cork pharmaceutical industry is Viagra. Cork is also the European headquarters of Apple Inc. where over 3,000 staff are involved in manufacturing, R&D and customer support. Logitech and EMC Corporation are also important IT employers in the area. Three hospitals are also among the top ten employers in the city.The city is also home to the Heineken Brewery that brews Murphy's Irish Stout and the nearby Beamish and Crawford brewery (taken over by Heineken in 2008) which have been in the city for generations. 45% of the world's Tic Tac sweets are manufactured at the city's Ferrero factory. For many years, Cork was the home to Ford Motor Company, which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984. Henry Ford's grandfather was from West Cork, which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in Cork. Technology has since replaced the older manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s, with people now working at a number of IT companies across the city area \u2013 such as Amazon.com, the online retailer, which has offices at Cork Airport Business Park.Cork's deep harbour allows large ships to enter, bringing trade and easy import/export of products. Cork Airport also allows easy access to continental Europe and Cork Kent railway station in the city centre provides good rail links for domestic trade.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nAccording to the 2011 Cork City Employment & Land Use Survey, the single largest employers in the city (all with over 1,000 employees) include Cork University Hospital, Apple Inc, University College Cork, Boston Scientific, Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology, Bon Secours Hospital, Cork, retailers Supervalu and Centra, the Irish Defence Forces at Collins Barracks, and the Mercy University Hospital.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCork Airport is the second busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and is situated on the south side of Cork city close to Ballygarvan. Nine airlines fly to more than 45 destinations in Europe. Scheduled airlines using Cork airport include Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air, Air France, Flybe, Iberia Express, Ryanair, Swiss International Air Lines and Volotea.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nPublic bus services within the city are provided by the national bus operator Bus \u00c9ireann. City routes are numbered from 201 through to 226 and connect the city centre to the principal suburbs, colleges, shopping centres and places of interest. Two of these bus routes provide orbital services across the Northern and Southern districts of the city respectively. Buses to the outer suburbs and towns, such as Ballincollig, Glanmire, Midleton and Carrigaline are provided from the city's bus terminal at Parnell Place in the city centre. Suburban services also include shuttles to Cork Airport, and a park and ride facility in the south suburbs only.\nLong-distance buses depart from the bus terminal in Parnell Place to destinations throughout Ireland. Hourly services run to Killarney/Tralee, Waterford, Athlone and Shannon Airport/Limerick/Galway and there are six services daily to Dublin. There is also a daily Eurolines bus service that connects Cork to Victoria Coach Station in London via South Wales and Bristol.\nPrivate operators include Irish Citylink, Aircoach and Dublin Coach. Irish Citylink serves Limerick and Galway. Aircoach operates an Express non-stop service which serves Dublin City Centre and Dublin Airport 18 times daily in each direction. Dublin Coach serves Dublin via Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cashel and Cahir.\n\n\n=== Harbour and waterways ===\n\nThe Cross River Ferry, from Rushbrooke to Passage West, links the R624 to R610. This service is used by some commuters to avoid traffic in the Jack Lynch Tunnel and Dunkettle area. The Port of Cork is situated at Ringaskiddy, 16 kilometres (10 miles) SE via the N28. Brittany Ferries operates direct car ferry services from Cork to Roscoff in France.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThe city's road infrastructure improved in the late 20th and early 21st century, including from the early 1980s construction of the Cork South Link dual carriageway which links the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly after, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued on extending the N25 South Ring Road through the 1990s, culminating in the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project \u2013 which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The M8 motorway links Cork with Dublin.\nFrom 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas. Subsequently, in 2014, a public bicycle rental scheme was launched. The scheme is operated by An Rothar Nua on behalf of the National Transport Authority, with funding supplemented by an advertising sponsor. The scheme supports 330 bikes with 31 stations placed around the city for paid public use.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Railway and tramway heritage ====\nCork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from Dublin Heuston. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at Blackpool, the route now reaches the city centre terminus of Kent Station via the Glanmire tunnel and Kilnap Viaduct. Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns of Cobh and Midleton east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of Youghal, until the 1980s.\n\nOther rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway, a line to Macroom, the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway to Blarney, Coachford and Donoughmore, as well as the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway connecting Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and many other West Cork towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement).\nWithin the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American George Francis Train in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line.In December 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company began operating on the Blackpool\u2013Douglas, Summerhill\u2013Sunday's Well and Tivoli\u2013Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.\nThe wider city area, including the city's suburbs, is served by three railway stations. These are Cork Kent railway station, Little Island railway station and Glounthaune railway station.\n\n\n==== Current routes ====\nCork's Kent Station is the main railway station in the city. From here, Irish Rail services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to Dublin has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork, and is linked from Limerick Junction with connections to Clonmel and Waterford. InterCity services are also available to Killarney and Tralee, and to Limerick, Ennis, Athenry and Galway (via Limerick Junction and the Limerick to Galway railway line).The Cork Suburban Rail system also departs from Kent Station and provides connections to parts of Metropolitan Cork. Stations include Little Island, Mallow, Midleton, Fota and Cobh. In July 2009 the Glounthaune to Midleton line was reopened, with new stations at Carrigtwohill and Midleton (and additional stations proposed for Blarney and elsewhere). Little Island railway station serves Cork's Eastern Suburbs.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCork is an important educational centre in Ireland \u2013 There are over 35,000 third level students in the city, meaning the city has a higher ratio of students in the population than the national average. Over 10% of the population of the Metropolitan area are students in University College Cork (UCC) and Cork Institute of Technology (CIT), including nearly 3,000 international students from over 100 different countries. UCC is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland and offers courses in arts, commerce, engineering, law, medicine and science. It  has been named \"Irish University of the Year\" four times since 2003, most recently in 2016. Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) was named Irish \"Institute of Technology of the Year\" in 2007, 2010 and 2016 and offers third level courses in Computing and IT, Business, Humanities and Engineering (Mechanical, Electronic, Electrical, and Chemical).\nThe National Maritime College of Ireland is located in Cork and is the only Irish college in which Nautical Studies and Marine Engineering can be undertaken. CIT incorporates the Cork School of Music and Crawford College of Art and Design as constituent schools. The Cork College of Commerce is the largest 'College of Further Education' in Ireland. Other 3rd level institutions include Griffith College Cork, a private institution, and various other colleges.\nResearch institutes linked to the third level colleges in the city support the research and innovation capacity of the city and region. Examples include the Tyndall National Institute (ICT hardware research), IMERC (Marine Energy), Environmental Research Institute, NIMBUS (Network Embedded Systems); and CREATE (Advanced Therapeutic Engineering). UCC and CIT also have start-up company incubation centres. In UCC, the IGNITE Graduate Business Innovation Centre aims to foster and support entrepreneurship. In CIT, The Rubicon Centre is a business innovation hub that is home to 57 knowledge based start-up companies.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nRugby, Gaelic football, hurling and association football are popular sporting pastimes for Corkonians.\n\n\n=== Gaelic games ===\n\nHurling and football are the most popular spectator sports in the city. Hurling has a strong identity with city and county \u2013 with Cork winning 30 All-Ireland Championships. Gaelic football is also popular, and Cork has won 7 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship titles. Cork is the only county that has won both championships at least 7 times and the only that has won both in the 21st century. There are many Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Cork City, including Blackrock National Hurling Club, St. Finbarr's, Glen Rovers, Na Piarsaigh, Nemo Rangers and Douglas GAA. The main public venues are P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh and P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Rinn (named after the noted Glen Rovers player Christy Ring). Camogie (hurling for ladies) and women's Gaelic football are increasing in popularity.\n\n\n=== Association football ===\n\nCork City F.C. are the largest and most successful association football team in Cork, winning three League of Ireland titles, four FAI Cup titles, and one \"All Ireland\" Setanta Sports Cup title. They play their home games on the south side of the city in Turners Cross. Several, now defunct, Cork clubs played in the League of Ireland before 1984. In total, teams from the city have won the league 12 times. Association football is also played by amateur and school clubs across the city, as well as in \"five-a-side\" style leagues.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\nRugby union is played at various levels, from school to senior league level. There are two first division clubs in Cork city. Cork Constitution (five-time All Ireland League Champions) play their home games in Ballintemple and Dolphin R.F.C. play at home in Musgrave Park. Other notable rugby clubs in the city include, Highfield, Sunday's Well and UCC. At schools level, Christian Brothers College and Presentation Brothers College are two of the country's better known rugby nurseries.\nMunster Rugby plays a number of its home matches in the Pro14 at Musgrave Park in Ballyphehane. In the past Heineken Cup matches have also been played at Musgrave Park, but most of these are now played at Thomond Park in Limerick. In May 2006 and again in May 2008 Munster became the Heineken Cup champions, with many players hailing from Cork city and county.\n\n\n=== Water sports ===\nThere are a variety of watersports in Cork, including rowing and sailing. There are five rowing clubs training on the river Lee, including Shandon BC, UCC RC, Pres RC, Lee RC, and Cork BC. Naomh\u00f3ga Chorca\u00ed is a rowing club whose members row traditional naomh\u00f3ga on the Lee in occasional competitions. The \"Ocean to City\" race has been held annually since 2005, and attracts teams and boats from local and visiting clubs who row the 24 kilometres (15 mi) from Crosshaven into Cork city centre. The National Rowing Center was moved to Inniscarra \u2013 approximately 12 km outside the city centre \u2013 in 2007. Cork's maritime sailing heritage is maintained through its sailing clubs. The Royal Cork Yacht Club located in Crosshaven (outside the city) is the world's oldest yacht club, and \"Cork Week\" is a notable sailing event.\n\n\n=== Cricket ===\n\nThe most notable cricket club in Cork is Cork County Cricket Club, which was formed in 1874. Although located within the Munster jurisdiction, the club plays in the Leinster Senior League. The club plays at the Mardyke, a ground which has hosted three first-class matches in 1947, 1961 and 1973. All three involved Ireland playing Scotland. The Cork Cricket Academy operates within the city, with the stated aim of introducing the sport to schools in the city and county. Cork's other main cricket club, Harlequins Cricket Club, play close to Cork Airport. The provincial representative side, the Munster Reds, plays its home matches in the Twenty20 Inter-Provincial Trophy at the Mardyke Cricket Ground.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe city contains clubs active in national competitions in basketball (Neptune and UCC Demons) and American Football (Cork Admirals). There are also golf, pitch and putt, hockey, tennis, and athletics clubs in the Cork area.\nThe city is the home of road bowling, which is played in the north-side and south-west suburbs. There are boxing and martial arts clubs (including Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Karate, Muay Thai and Taekwondo) within the city, while the sports-based performance art of professional wrestling maintains a presence via local promotion Phoenix Wrestling. Cork Racing, a motorsport team based in Cork, has raced in the Irish Formula Ford Championship since 2005. Cork also hosts one of Ireland's most successful Australian Rules Football teams, the Leeside Lions, who have won the Australian Rules Football League of Ireland Premiership several times.\n\n\n== Twin cities ==\n\nCork is twinned with Cologne, Coventry, Rennes, San Francisco, Swansea and Shanghai. As of February 2017, the city council was also in talks to twin with Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg and Miami.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Cork City and its suburbs was recorded as 208,669 by the 2016 census, with in excess of 300,000 in the Metropolitan Cork area.\nThere were 119,230 people present in the Cork City Council administered area at the time of the 2011 census, of these 117,221 indicated that they were usually present in Cork. In common with other Irish urban centres, the female population (50.67%) is higher than the male population (49.33%), although the gap is somewhat smaller than in other cities.\n\nIn the 2011 census, of those usually resident, 100,901 (86.08%) were Irish citizens; 10,295 (8.78%) were citizens of other EU countries; 4,316 (3.68%) were citizens of countries elsewhere in the world; 1,709 (1.46%) did not state their citizenship. By the 2016 census, the population of the city and suburbs were 81% white Irish, 10% other white, 1.4% black/black Irish, 2.5% Asian/Asian Irish, 1.7% other, with 2.6% not stating an ethnicity. Also as of the census, the population was 76.4% Catholic, 8.1% other stated religion, with 12.8% having no religion and 2.7% not stated.While Cork saw some Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe in the 19th century, with second-generation immigrants like Gerald Goldberg holding public office, the community later declined and the synagogue closed. Later immigrant communities retain their places of worship. In the 2011 and 2016 censuses, Roman Catholicism was the most common religion in the city overall, followed by Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, and Islam. As of the 2016 census, an increasing number of residents (15%) indicated that they had no religion \u2013 a higher rate of increase and a higher overall percentage than the national average (10%).\n\n\n=== City boundary expansion ===\n\nLegislation to expand the boundary of the city, which would increase its area to 187 km2 (72 sq mi) and the population within its bounds from 125,000 to 210,000, was debated and approved in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in June 2018. Corresponding legislation was drafted during July 2018, and signed into law, as part of the Local Government Act 2018, by President Michael D. Higgins in January 2019. The boundary change occurred at the end of May 2019, following the 2019 local elections.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMerchants, Mystics and Philanthropists \u2013 350 Years of Cork Quakers Richard S.

        "wiki": "Collins Barracks (Irish: D\u00fan U\u00ed Choile\u00e1in) is a military barracks on the Old Youghal Road on the north side of Cork in Ireland. Originally serving as a British military barracks from the early 19th century, it was handed-over to the Irish military following the Irish War of Independence, and remains the headquarters of the 1st Brigade of the Irish Army. A museum in the barracks is open to the public at selected times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nOriginally erected between 1801 and 1806, the barracks' works were completed by Abraham Hargrave to designs by John Gibson. Located in a prominent position on the hills overlooking Cork city and the River Lee, the complex was initially known simply as The Barracks. It was extended in 1849 and renamed to Victoria Barracks, to celebrate a visit by Queen Victoria.\n\n\n=== Independence ===\nIn the period following the Easter Rising (1916), the Irish nationalist Thomas Kent was executed by firing squad at the barracks. He was the only person outside Dublin, apart from Roger Casement, to be executed for participation following the Rising.During the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), Auxiliary forces based at the barracks were implicated in events surrounding the Burning of Cork. British forces from the barracks were also involved in the executions of several Republican prisoners. On 1 February 1921 Cornelius Murphy was executed and then on 28 April 1921, four Volunteers, Maurice Moore, Thomas Mulcahy, Patrick O'Sullivan and Patrick Ronayne, were executed by firing squad at the barracks, followed by the execution of Patrick Casey a few days later, and of Daniel O'Brien on 16 May 1921.\n\nFollowing the War of Independence, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and after housing British forces in the city for more than one hundred years, the barracks complex was handed over to Commandant Sean Murray of the army of the Irish Free State in 1922. Key buildings within the barracks were substantially damaged by retreating Anti-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War. After this conflict, the barracks was renamed for Michael Collins, the first commander-in-chief of the Free State, and a native of County Cork.\n\n\n=== Late 20th century ===\nA garrison for the Southern Command of the Irish Army since the 1920s, the complex was visited by US President John F. Kennedy in 1963.The barracks now houses the headquarters of 1 Southern Brigade, with permanent and reserve elements of several army corps, including artillery, cavalry, communications, engineering and logistics units.From 2003 the barracks was subject to a modernisation programme, with the building of new messing facilities, a gymnasium and other works.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCork Prison\nList of Irish military installations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Barracks: A History of Victoria/Collins Barracks.

        "wiki": "The tomato is the edible, often red berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant.  The species originated in western South America and Central America. The Nahuatl (the language used by the Aztecs) word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived. Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.\nThe tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits\u2014botanically classified as berries\u2014they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year. Tomato plants typically grow to 1\u20133 meters (3\u201310 ft) in height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support. Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals. (Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1\u201310 cm (1\u20442\u20134 in) in width.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe word \"tomato\" comes from the Spanish tomate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl [\u02c8tomat\u0361\u026c], meaning \"the swelling fruit\". The native Mexican tomatillo is tomate (in Nahuatl: tom\u0101tl pronunciation , meaning \"fat water\" or \"fat thing\").  When Aztecs started to cultivate the fruit to be larger, sweeter, and red, they called the new species  xitomatl (or jitomates) (pronounced [\u0283i\u02d0\u02c8tomat\u026c]), (\"plump with navel\"  or \"fat water with navel\"). The scientific species epithet lycopersicum is interpreted literally from Latin in the 1753 book, Species Plantarum, as \"wolfpeach\", where wolf is from lyco and peach is from persicum.\n\n\n=== Pronunciation ===\nThe usual pronunciations of \"tomato\" are  (usual in American English) and  (usual in British English). The word's dual pronunciations were immortalized in Ira and George Gershwin's 1937 song  \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\" (\"You like  and I like  / You like  and I like \") and have become a symbol for nitpicking pronunciation disputes. In this capacity, it has even become an American and British slang term: saying \"\" when presented with two choices can mean \"What's the difference?\" or \"It's all the same to me\".\n\n\n=== Fruit versus vegetable ===\n\nBotanically, a tomato is a fruit\u2014a berry, consisting of the ovary, together with its seeds, of a flowering plant. However, the tomato is considered a \"culinary vegetable\" because it has a much lower sugar content than culinary fruits; it is typically served as part of a salad or main course of a meal, rather than as a dessert. Tomatoes are not the only food source with this ambiguity; bell peppers, cucumbers, green beans, eggplants, avocados, and squashes of all kinds (such as zucchini and pumpkins) are all botanically fruit, yet cooked as vegetables. This has led to legal dispute in the United States. In 1887, U.S. tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruit, caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance. The U.S. Supreme Court settled this controversy on May 10, 1893, by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use\u2014they are generally served with dinner and not dessert (Nix v. Hedden (149 U.S. 304)). The holding of this case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff of 1883, and the court did not purport to reclassify the tomato for botanical or other purposes.\n\n\n== Botany ==\n\n\n=== Description ===\n\nTomato plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm (6 ft) or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) tall or shorter. Indeterminate types are \"tender\" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases. Determinate types are annual in all climates.Tomato plants are dicots, and grow as a series of branching stems, with a terminal bud at the tip that does the actual growing. When that tip eventually stops growing, whether because of pruning or flowering, lateral buds take over and grow into other, fully functional, vines.Tomato vines are typically pubescent, meaning covered with fine short hairs. These hairs facilitate the vining process, turning into roots wherever the plant is in contact with the ground and moisture, especially if the vine's connection to its original root has been damaged or severed.Most tomato plants have compound leaves, and are called regular leaf (RL) plants, but some cultivars have simple leaves known as potato leaf (PL) style because of their resemblance to that particular relative. Of RL plants, there are variations, such as rugose leaves, which are deeply grooved, and variegated, angora leaves, which have additional colors where a genetic mutation causes chlorophyll to be excluded from some portions of the leaves.The leaves are 10\u201325 cm (4\u201310 in) long, odd pinnate, with five to nine leaflets on petioles, each leaflet up to 8 cm (3 in) long, with a serrated margin; both the stem and leaves are densely glandular-hairy.Their flowers, appearing on the apical meristem, have the anthers fused along the edges, forming a column surrounding the pistil's style. Flowers in domestic cultivars can be self-fertilizing. The flowers are 1\u20132 cm (1\u20442\u20133\u20444 in) across, yellow, with five pointed lobes on the corolla; they are borne in a cyme of three to 12 together.Although in culinary terms, tomato is regarded as a vegetable, its fruit is classified botanically as a berry. As a true fruit, it develops from the ovary of the plant after fertilization, its flesh comprising the pericarp walls. The fruit contains hollow spaces full of seeds and moisture, called locular cavities. These vary, among cultivated species, according to type. Some smaller varieties have two cavities, globe-shaped varieties typically have three to five, beefsteak tomatoes have a great number of smaller cavities, while paste tomatoes have very few, very small cavities.For propagation, the seeds need to come from a mature fruit, and be dried or fermented before germination.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nIn 1753, Linnaeus placed the tomato in the genus Solanum (alongside the potato) as Solanum lycopersicum. In 1768, Philip Miller moved it to its own genus, naming it Lycopersicon esculentum. This name came into wide use, but was technically in breach of the plant naming rules because Linnaeus's species name lycopersicum still had priority. Although the name Lycopersicum lycopersicum was suggested by Karsten (1888), this is not used because it violates the International Code of Nomenclature barring the use of tautonyms in botanical nomenclature. The corrected name Lycopersicon lycopersicum (Nicolson 1974) was technically valid, since Miller's genus name and Linnaeus's species name differ in exact spelling, but since Lycopersicon esculentum has become so well known, it was officially listed as a nomen conservandum in 1983, and would be the correct name for the tomato in classifications which do not place the tomato in the genus Solanum.\nGenetic evidence has now shown that Linnaeus was correct to put the tomato in the genus Solanum, making Solanum lycopersicum the correct name. Both names, however, will probably be found in the literature for some time. Two of the major reasons for considering the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent in the tomato). On the other hand, hybrids of tomato and diploid potato can be created in the lab by somatic fusion, and are partially fertile, providing evidence of the close relationship between these species.\n\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n\nTomatoes that have been modified using genetic engineering have been developed, and although none are commercially available now, they have been in the past. The first commercially available genetically modified food was a variety of tomato named the Flavr Savr, which was engineered to have a longer shelf life. Scientists are continuing to develop tomatoes with new traits not found in natural crops, such as increased resistance to pests or environmental stresses. Other projects aim to enrich tomatoes with substances that may offer health benefits or provide better nutrition.\nAn international consortium of researchers from 10 countries, among them researchers from the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, began sequencing the tomato genome in 2004, and is creating a database of genomic sequences and information on the tomato and related plants. A prerelease version of the genome was made available in December 2009. The genomes of its mitochondria and chloroplasts are also being sequenced as part of the project. The complete genome for the cultivar Heinz 1706 was published on 31 May 2012 in Nature. Since many other fruits, like strawberries, apples, melons, and bananas share the same characteristics and genes, researchers stated the published genome could help to improve food quality, food security and reduce costs of all of these fruits.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nThe Tomato Genetic Resource Center, Germplasm Resources Information Network, AVRDC, and numerous seed banks around the world store seed representing genetic variations of value to modern agriculture. These seed stocks are available for legitimate breeding and research efforts. While individual breeding efforts can produce useful results, the bulk of tomato breeding work is at universities and major agriculture-related corporations. These efforts have resulted in significant regionally adapted breeding lines and hybrids, such as the Mountain series from North Carolina. Corporations including Heinz, Monsanto, BHNSeed, and Bejoseed have breeding programs that attempt to improve production, size, shape, color, flavor, disease tolerance, pest tolerance, nutritional value, and numerous other traits.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe wild ancestor of the tomato is native to western South America. These wild versions were the size of peas. The Spanish first introduced tomatoes to Europe, where they became used in Spanish and Italian food. In France and northern Europe, the tomato was initially grown as an ornamental plant. It was regarded with suspicion as a food because botanists recognized it as a nightshade, a relative of the poisonous belladonna. This was exacerbated by the interaction of the tomato's acidic juice with pewter plates. The leaves and immature fruit contains tomatine, which in large quantities would be toxic. However, the ripe fruit contains no tomatine.\n\n\n=== Mesoamerica ===\nAztecs and other peoples in Mesoamerica were the first to have domesticated the fruit and used in their cooking. The exact date of domestication is unknown; by 500 BC, it was already being cultivated in southern Mexico and probably other areas. The Pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination. The large, lumpy variety of tomato, a mutation from a smoother, smaller fruit, originated in Mesoamerica, and may be the direct ancestor of some modern cultivated tomatoes.\n\n\n=== Spanish distribution ===\nSpanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s may have been the first to transfer the small yellow tomato to Europe after he captured the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, in 1521, although Christopher Columbus may have taken them back as early as 1493. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, an Italian physician and botanist, who suggested that a new type of eggplant had been brought to Italy that was blood red or golden color when mature and could be divided into segments and eaten like an eggplant\u2014that is, cooked and seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oil.  It was not until ten years later that tomatoes were named in print by Mattioli as pomi d'oro, or \"golden apples\".After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean. They also took it to the Philippines, from where it spread to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent. The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe. It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 17th century in Spain.\n\n\n=== China ===\nThe tomato was introduced to China, likely via the Philippines or Macau, in the 1500s. It was given the name f\u0101nqi\u00e9 (barbarian eggplant), as the Chinese named many foodstuffs introduced from abroad, but referring specifically to early introductions.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nThe recorded history of tomatoes in Italy dates back to at least 31 October 1548, when the house steward of Cosimo de' Medici, the grand duke of Tuscany, wrote to the Medici private secretary informing him that the basket of tomatoes sent from the grand duke's Florentine estate at Torre del Gallo \"had arrived safely\". Tomatoes were grown mainly as ornamentals early on after their arrival in Italy. For example, the Florentine aristocrat Giovanvettorio Soderini wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\", and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. The tomato's ability to mutate and create new and different varieties helped contribute to its success and spread throughout Italy. However, even in areas where the climate supported growing tomatoes, their habit of growing to the ground suggested low status. They were not adopted as a staple of the peasant population because they were not as filling as other fruits already available. Additionally, both toxic and inedible varieties discouraged many people from attempting to consume or prepare any other varieties. In certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as a tabletop decoration, until it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century. The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources.Unique varieties were developed over the next several hundred years for uses such as dried tomatoes, sauce tomatoes, pizza tomatoes, and tomatoes for long-term storage. These varieties are usually known for their place of origin as much as by a variety name. For example, Pomodorino del Piennolo del Vesuvio is the \"hanging tomato of Vesuvius\" or the Pomodoro di Pachino and Pomodorino di Manduria.\n\n\n=== Britain ===\n\nTomatoes were not grown in England until the 1590s. One of the earliest cultivators was John Gerard, a barber-surgeon. Gerard's Herbal, published in 1597, and largely plagiarized from continental sources, is also one of the earliest discussions of the tomato in England. Gerard knew the tomato was eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous (in fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous; see below). Gerard's views were influential, and the tomato was considered unfit for eating (though not necessarily poisonous) for many years in Britain and its North American colonies.However, by the mid-18th century, tomatoes were widely eaten in Britain, and before the end of that century, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica stated the tomato was \"in daily use\" in soups, broths, and as a garnish.  They were not part of the average person's diet, and though by 1820 they were described as \"to be seen in great abundance in all our vegetable markets\" and to be \"used by all our best cooks\", reference was made to their cultivation in gardens still \"for the singularity of their appearance\", while their use in cooking was associated with exotic Italian or Jewish cuisine.\n\n\n=== India ===\nThe tomato arrived in India by the way of Portuguese explorers, in the 16th century.\nIt was grown from the 18th century onwards for the British. \nEven today, in Bengal, the name is \"Vilayati Begun\", meaning \"Foreign Eggplant\"\nIt was then adopted widely as it is well suited to India's climate, with Uttarakhand as one of the main producers.\n\n\n=== Middle East and North Africa ===\nThe tomato was introduced to cultivation in the Middle East by John Barker, British consul in Aleppo circa 1799 to 1825. Nineteenth century descriptions of its consumption are uniformly as an ingredient in a cooked dish. In 1881, it is described as only eaten in the region \"within the last forty years\". Today, the tomato is a critical and ubiquitous part of Middle Eastern cuisine, served fresh in salads (e.g., Arab salad, Israeli salad, Shirazi salad and Turkish salad), grilled with kebabs and other dishes, made into sauces, and so on.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\nThe earliest reference to tomatoes being grown in British North America is from 1710, when herbalist William Salmon reported seeing them in what is today South Carolina. They may have been introduced from the Caribbean. By the mid-18th century, they were cultivated on some Carolina plantations, and probably in other parts of the Southeast as well. Possibly, some people continued to think tomatoes were poisonous at this time; and in general, they were grown more as ornamental plants than as food. Thomas Jefferson, who ate tomatoes in Paris, sent some seeds back to America.Early tomato breeders included Henry Tilden in Iowa and a Dr. Hand in Baltimore.Alexander W. Livingston receives much credit for developing numerous varieties of tomato for both home and commercial gardeners. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1937 yearbook declared that \"half of the major varieties were a result of the abilities of the Livingstons to evaluate and perpetuate superior material in the tomato.\" Livingston's first breed of tomato, the Paragon, was introduced in 1870. In 1875, he introduced the Acme, which was said to be involved in the parentage of most of the tomatoes introduced by him and his competitors for the next twenty-five years.When Livingston began his attempts to develop the tomato as a commercial crop, his aim had been to grow tomatoes smooth in contour, uniform in size, and sweet in flavor. In 1870, Livingston introduced the Paragon, and tomato culture soon became a great enterprise in the county. He eventually developed over seventeen different varieties of the tomato plant. Today, the crop is grown in every state in the Union.Because of the long growing season needed for this heat-loving crop, several states in the US Sun Belt became major tomato-producers, particularly Florida and California. In California, tomatoes are grown under irrigation for both the fresh fruit market and for canning and processing. The University of California, Davis (UC Davis) became a major center for research on the tomato. The C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis is a gene bank of wild relatives, monogenic mutants and miscellaneous genetic stocks of tomato. The center is named for the late Dr. Charles M. Rick, a pioneer in tomato genetics research. Research on processing tomatoes is also conducted by the California Tomato Research Institute in Escalon, California.In California, growers have used a method of cultivation called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes. This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that retains moisture, such as clayey soil.\n\n\n=== Modern commercial varieties ===\nThe poor taste and lack of sugar in modern garden and commercial tomato varieties resulted from breeding tomatoes to ripen uniformly red. This change occurred after discovery of a mutant \"u\" phenotype in the mid 20th century that ripened \"u\"niformly. This was widely cross-bred to produce red fruit without the typical green ring around the stem on uncross-bred varieties. Prior to general introduction of this trait, most tomatoes produced more sugar during ripening, and were sweeter and more flavorful.Evidence has been found that 10\u201320% of the total carbon fixed in the fruit can be produced by photosynthesis in the developing fruit of the normal U phenotype.  The u genetic mutation encodes a factor that produces defective chloroplasts with lower density in developing fruit, resulting in a lighter green colour of unripe fruit, and repression of sugars accumulation in the resulting ripe fruit by 10\u201315%. Perhaps more important than their role in photosynthesis, the fruit chloroplasts are remodelled during ripening into chlorophyll-free chromoplasts that synthesize and accumulate lycopene, \u03b2-carotene, and other metabolites that are sensory and nutritional assets of the ripe fruit.  The potent chloroplasts in the dark-green shoulders of the U phenotype are beneficial here, but have the disadvantage of leaving green shoulders near the stems of the ripe fruit, and even cracked yellow shoulders, apparently because of oxidative stress due to overload of the photosynthetic chain in direct sunlight at high temperatures.  Hence genetic design of a commercial variety that combines the advantages of types u and U requires fine tuning, but may be feasible.Furthermore, breeders of modern tomato cultivars typically strive to produce tomato plants exhibiting improved yield, shelf life, size, and tolerance/resistance to various environmental pressures, including disease. However, these breeding efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various tomato fruit attributes. For instance, linkage drag is a phenomenon that has been responsible for alterations in the metabolism of the tomato fruit. Linkage drag describes the introduction of an undesired trait or allele into a plant during backcrossing. This trait/allele is physically linked (or is very close) to the desired allele along the chromosome. In introducing the beneficial allele, there exists a high likelihood that the poor allele is also incorporated into the plant. Thus, breeding efforts attempting to enhance certain traits (for example: larger fruit size) have unintentionally altered production of chemicals associated with, for instance, nutritional value and flavor.Breeders have turned to using wild tomato species as a source of alleles for the introduction of beneficial traits into modern tomato varieties. For example, wild tomato relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (which are associated with greater sugar content) or resistance to diseases caused by microbes, such as resistance towards the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani. However, this tactic has limitations, for the incorporation of certain traits, such as pathogen resistance, can negatively impact other favorable phenotypes (fruit production, etc.).\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars. A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 5\u201310\u201310 is often sold as tomato fertilizer or vegetable fertilizer, although manure and compost are also used.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Production ===\n\nIn 2018, world production of tomatoes was 182 million tonnes, with China accounting for 34% of the total, followed by India, the United States, and Turkey as major producers (table).\n\n\n=== Varieties ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Diseases, pests, and disorders ===\n\nTomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants.\nVarious forms of mildew and blight are common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato cultivars are often marked with a combination of letters that refer to specific disease resistance. The most common letters are: LB \u2013 late blight, V \u2013 verticillium wilt, F \u2013 fusarium wilt strain I, FF \u2013 fusarium wilt strain I and II, N \u2013 nematodes, T \u2013 tobacco mosaic virus, and A \u2013 alternaria.\nSome common tomato pests are stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants.Another particularly dreaded disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone . Systemin activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects. The hormone was first identified in tomatoes, but similar proteins have been identified in other species since.Although not a disease as such, irregular supplies of water can cause growing or ripening fruit to split. Besides cosmetic damage, the splits may allow decay to start, although growing fruits have some ability to heal after a split. In addition, a deformity called cat-facing can be caused by pests, temperature stress, or poor soil conditions. Affected fruit usually remains edible, but its appearance may be unsightly.\n\n\n=== Companion plants ===\n\nTomatoes serve, or are served by, a large variety of companion plants.\nAmong the most famous pairings is the tomato plant and carrots; studies supporting this relationship have produced a popular book about companion planting, Carrots Love Tomatoes.The devastating tomato hornworm has a major predator in various parasitic wasps, whose larvae devour the hornworm, but whose adult form drinks nectar from tiny-flowered plants like umbellifers. Several species of umbellifer are therefore often grown with tomato plants, including parsley, Queen Anne's lace, and occasionally dill. These also attract predatory flies that attack various tomato pests.Borage is thought to repel the tomato hornworm moth.Plants with strong scents, like alliums (onions, chives, garlic), mints (basil, oregano, spearmint) and French marigold, (Tagetes patula) are thought to mask the scent of the tomato plant, making it harder for pests to locate it, or to provide an alternative landing point, reducing the odds of the pests from attacking the correct plant. These plants may also subtly affect the flavor of tomato fruit.Tomato plants can protect asparagus from asparagus beetles, because they contain solanine that kills this pest, while asparagus plants contain Asparagusic acid that repels nematodes known to attack tomato plants. Marigolds also repel nematodes.\n\n\n=== Pollination ===\n\nIn the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross-pollination; they were much more self-incompatible than domestic cultivars. As a floral device to reduce selfing, the pistil of wild tomatoes extends farther out of the flower than today's cultivars. The stamens were, and remain, entirely within the closed corolla.\nAs tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional pollinators, (probably a species of halictid bee) did not move with them. The trait of self-fertility became an advantage, and domestic cultivars of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait.This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in greenhouse situations, where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an \"electric bee\" that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured bumblebees. The anther of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the pollen produced within the structure, rather than on the surface, as in most species. The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of externally-induced motion. The ideal vibratory frequencies to release pollen grains are provided by an insect, such as a bumblebee, or the original wild halictid pollinator, capable of engaging in a behavior known as buzz pollination, which honey bees cannot perform. In an outdoors setting, wind or animals usually provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.\n\n\n=== Fruit formation ===\nPollination and fruit formation depend on meiosis.  Meiosis is central to the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei.  Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either by self- or cross-pollination.  Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed.  Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit.\nHomologs of the recA gene, including rad51, play a key role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during meiosis.  A rad51 homolog is present in the anther of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), suggesting that recombinational repair occurs during meiosis in tomato.\n\n\n=== Hydroponic and greenhouse cultivation ===\nTomatoes are often grown in greenhouses in cooler climates, and cultivars such as the British 'Moneymaker' and a number of cultivars grown in Siberia are specifically bred for indoor growing. In more temperate climates, it is not uncommon to start seeds in greenhouses during the late winter for future transplant.\nGreenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is on the increase, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available. Smaller sized fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers.Hydroponic technique is often used in hostile growing environments, as well as high-density plantings.\n\n\n=== Picking and ripening ===\nTo facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with ethylene.A machine-harvestable variety of tomato (the \"square tomato\") was developed in the 1950s by University of California, Davis's Gordie C. Hanna, which, in combination with the development of a suitable harvester, revolutionized the tomato-growing industry. This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked. They are harvested 24 hours a day, seven days a week during a 12- to 14-week season, and immediately transported to packing plants, which operate on the same schedule. California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces about a third of the processed tomatoes produced in the world.In 1994, Calgene introduced a genetically modified tomato called the FlavrSavr, which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf life. However, the product was not commercially successful, and was sold only until 1997.\n\n\n=== Yield ===\nThe world dedicated 4.8 million hectares in 2012 for tomato cultivation and the total production was about 161.8 million tonnes.\nThe average world farm yield for tomato was 33.6 tonnes per hectare, in 2012.Tomato farms in the Netherlands were the most productive in 2012, with a nationwide average of 476 tonnes per hectare, followed by Belgium (463 tonnes per hectare) and Iceland (429 tonnes per hectare).\n\n\n=== Records ===\n\nAs of 2008, the heaviest tomato harvested, weighed 3.51 kg (7 lb 12 oz), was of the cultivar \"Delicious\", and was grown by Gordon Graham of Edmond, Oklahoma in 1986. The largest tomato plant grown was of the cultivar \"Sungold\" and reached 19.8 m (65 ft) in length, grown by Nutriculture Ltd (UK) of Mawdesley, Lancashire, UK, in 2000.A massive \"tomato tree\" growing inside the Walt Disney World Resort's experimental greenhouses in Lake Buena Vista, Florida may have been the largest single tomato plant in the world. The plant has been recognized as a Guinness World Record Holder, with a harvest of more than 32,000 tomatoes and a total weight of 522 kg (1,151 lb). It yielded thousands of tomatoes at one time from a single vine. Yong Huang, Epcot's manager of agricultural science, discovered the unique plant in Beijing, China. Huang brought its seeds to Epcot and created the specialized greenhouse for the fruit to grow. The vine grew golf ball-sized tomatoes, which were served at Walt Disney World restaurants. The tree developed a disease and was removed in April 2010 after about 13 months of life.\n\n\n== Consumption ==\n\nThough it is botanically a berry, a subset of fruit, the tomato is a vegetable for culinary purposes because of its savory flavor (see below).\nAlthough tomatoes originated in the Americas, they have become extensively used in Mediterranean cuisine. Ripe tomatoes contain significant umami flavor and they are a key ingredient in pizza, and are commonly used in pasta sauces.\n\nThey are also used in gazpacho (Spanish cuisine) and pa amb tom\u00e0quet (Catalan cuisine).\nThe tomato is now grown and eaten around the world. It is used in diverse ways, including raw in salads or in slices, stewed, incorporated into a wide variety of dishes, or processed into ketchup or tomato soup.  Unripe green tomatoes can also be breaded and fried, used to make salsa, or pickled. Tomato juice is sold as a drink, and is used in cocktails such as the Bloody Mary.\n\n\n=== Storage ===\nTomatoes keep best unwashed at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. It is not recommended to refrigerate them as this can harm the flavor.  Tomatoes stored cold tend to lose their flavor permanently.Storing stem down can prolong shelf life, as it may keep from rotting too quickly.Tomatoes that are not yet ripe can be kept in a paper bag till ripening.Tomatoes are easy to preserve whole, in pieces, as tomato sauce or paste by home canning. They are acidic enough to process in a water bath rather than a pressure cooker as most vegetables require. The fruit is also preserved by drying, often in the sun, and sold either in bags or in jars with oil.\n\n\n=== Safety ===\n\n\n==== Plant toxicity ====\nThe leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine, whose effect on humans has not been studied. They also contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family. Because of this, the use of tomato leaves in herbal tea has been responsible for at least one death. However, solanine concentrations in foliage and green fruit are generally too small to be dangerous unless large amounts are consumed\u2014for example, as greens.\nSmall amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring without ill effect, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes. There are also tomato varieties with fully ripe fruit that is still green. Compared to potatoes, the amount of solanine in unripe green or fully ripe tomatoes is low. However, even in the case of potatoes, while solanine poisoning resulting from dosages several times normal human consumption has been demonstrated, actual cases of poisoning from excessive consumption of potatoes are rare.Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material.\n\n\n==== Salmonella ====\nTomatoes were linked to seven Salmonella outbreaks between 1990 and 2005, and may have been the cause of a salmonellosis outbreak causing 172 illnesses in 18 US states in 2006. The 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak caused the temporary removal of tomatoes from stores and restaurants across the United States and parts of Canada, although other foods, including jalape\u00f1o and serrano peppers, may have been involved.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nA tomato is 95% water, contains 4% carbohydrates and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table). In a 100 gram amount, raw tomatoes supply 18 calories and are a moderate source of vitamin C (17% of the Daily Value), but otherwise are absent of significant nutrient content (table).\n\n\n=== Potential health effects ===\nNo conclusive evidence indicates that the lycopene in tomatoes or in supplements affects the onset of cardiovascular diseases or cancer.In the United States, supposed health benefits of consuming tomatoes, tomato products or lycopene to affect cancer cannot be mentioned on packaged food products without a qualified health claim statement. In a scientific review of potential claims for lycopene favorably affecting DNA, skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation, heart function and vision, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that the evidence for lycopene having any of these effects was inconclusive.\n\n\n== Host plant ==\nThe Potato Tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family Solanaceae such as tomato plants. Female P. operculella use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nOn 30 August 2007, 40,000 Spaniards gathered in Bu\u00f1ol to throw 115,000 kg (254,000 lb) of tomatoes at each other in the yearly Tomatina festival.In Ontario, Canada, member of provincial parliament Mike Colle introduced a private member's bill in March 2016 to name the tomato as the official vegetable of the province and to designate 15 July as Tomato Day, in order to acknowledge the tomato's importance in Ontario's agriculture. The bill did not pass in the legislature and no official designations were made.\n\nTomatoes have been designated the state vegetable of New Jersey. Arkansas took both sides by declaring the South Arkansas Vine Ripe Pink Tomato both the state fruit and the state vegetable in the same law, citing both its culinary and botanical classifications. In 2009, the state of Ohio passed a law making the tomato the state's official fruit. Tomato juice has been the official beverage of Ohio since 1965. Alexander W. Livingston, of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, played a large part in popularizing the tomato in the late 19th century; his efforts are commemorated in Reynoldsburg with an annual Tomato Festival.\nFlavr Savr was the first commercially grown genetically engineered food licensed for human consumption.The town of Bu\u00f1ol, Spain, annually celebrates La Tomatina, a festival centered on an enormous tomato fight. Tomatoes are a popular \"nonlethal\" throwing weapon in mass protests, and there was a common tradition of throwing rotten tomatoes at bad performers on a stage during the 19th century; today this is usually referenced as a metaphor. Embracing it for this protest connotation, the Dutch Socialist party adopted the tomato as their logo.\nThe US city of Reynoldsburg, Ohio calls itself \"The Birthplace of the Tomato\", claiming the first commercial variety of tomato was bred there in the 19th century.Several US states have adopted the tomato as a state fruit or vegetable (see above).\n\"Rotten Tomatoes\" is an American review-aggregation website for film and television. The name \"Rotten Tomatoes\" derives from the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes when disapproving of a poor stage performance. \"Rotten Tomatoes\" took the tomato metaphor further by rating films as Certified Fresh if they got a score of 75% or higher, Fresh for films with a score of 60% or higher that do not meet the requirements for the Certified Fresh seal, and Rotten for films with a score of 0\u201359%.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Gentilcore.

        "wiki": "Theobald Mathew (10 October 1790 \u2013 8 December 1856) was an Irish Catholic priest and teetotalist reformer, popularly known as Father Mathew. He was born at Thomastown, near Golden, County Tipperary, on 10 October 1790, to James Mathew and his wife Anne, daughter of George Whyte, of Cappaghwhyte. Of the family of the Earls Landaff (his father, James, was first cousin of Thomas Mathew, father of the first earl), he was a kinsman of the clergyman Arnold Mathew.He received his schooling in Kilkenny, then moved for a short time to Maynooth. From 1808 to 1814 he studied in Dublin, where in the latter year he was ordained to the priesthood. Having entered the Capuchin order, after a brief period of service at Kilkenny, he joined the mission in Cork.Statues of Mathew stand on St. Patrick's Street, Cork, by J. H. Foley (1864), and on O'Connell Street, Dublin, by Mary Redmond (1893). There is a Fr. Mathew Bridge in Limerick City, named after the temperance reformer when it was rebuilt between 1844 and 1846. The Capuchin church in Cork, Holy Trinity, stands on Father Mathew Quay and was commissioned by him.\n\n\n== Total Abstinence Society ==\n\nThe movement with which his name is associated began on 10 April 1838 with the establishment of the \"Cork Total Abstinence Society\", which in less than nine months enrolled no fewer than 150,000 names. It rapidly spread to Limerick and elsewhere, and some idea of its popularity may be formed from the fact that at Nenagh 20,000 persons are said to have taken the pledge in one day, 100,000 at Galway in two days, and 70,000 in Dublin in five days. At its height, just before the Great Famine of 1845\u201349, his movement enrolled some 3 million people, or more than half of the adult population of Ireland. In 1844, he visited Liverpool, Manchester and London with almost equal success.\nA biography, written shortly after his death, credits Mathew's work with a reduction in Irish crime figures of the era:The number of homicides, which was 247 in 1838, was only 105 in 1841.  There were 91 cases of 'firing at the person' reported in 1837, and but 66 in 1841. The 'assaults on police' were 91 in 1837, and but 58 in 1841. Incendiary fires, which were as many as 459 in 1838, were 390 in 1841. Robberies, thus specially reported, diminished from 725 in 1837, to 257 in 1841. The decrease in cases of 'robbery of arms' was most significant; from being 246 in 1837, they were but 111 in 1841. The offence of 'appearing in arms' showed a favourable diminution, falling from 110 in 1837, to 66 in 1841. The effect of sobriety on 'faction fights' was equally remarkable. There were 20 of such cases in 1839, and 8 in 1841. The dangerous offence of 'rescuing prisoners', which was represented by 34 in 1837, had no return in 1841! The number committed to jail fell from 12,049 in 1839 to 9,875 by 1845. Sentences of death fell from 66 in 1839 to 14 in 1846, and transportations fell from 916 to 504 over the same period.\n\n\n== In the United States ==\n\nMathew visited the United States in 1849, returning in 1851. While there, he found himself at the center of the Abolitionist debate. Many of his hosts, including John Hughes, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, were anti-abolitionists and wanted assurances that Mathew would not stray outside his remit of battling alcohol consumption. But Mathew had signed a petition (along with 60,000 Irish people, including Daniel O'Connell) encouraging the Irish in the US not to partake in slavery in 1841 during Charles Lenox Remond's tour of Ireland.In order to avoid upsetting these anti-abolitionist friends in the US, he snubbed an invitation to publicly condemn chattel slavery, sacrificing his friendship with that movement. He defended his position by pointing out that there was nothing in the scripture that prohibited slavery. He was condemned by many on the abolitionist side, including the former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass who had received the pledge from Mathew in Cork in 1845. Douglass felt \"grieved, humbled and mortified\" by Mathew's decision to ignore slavery while campaigning in the US and \"wondered how being a Catholic priest should inhibit him from denouncing the sin of slavery as much as the sin of intemperance.\" Douglass felt it was his duty to now \"denounce and expose the conduct of Father Mathew\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nMathew died on 8 December 1856 in Queenstown, County Cork (present-day Cobh), and was interred in St. Joseph\u2019s Cemetery, Cork, a cemetery which he had himself established.\n\n\n== Father Mathew's Tower ==\nIn 1842, at his own expense, landowner William O'Connor built a castellated neo-Gothic stone tower to commemorate Father Mathew on what was then called Mount Patrick and is now known as Tower Hill in Glounthaune which is a hamlet approximately ten miles from the city of Cork. The tower is still extant and has since been converted into a private residence while retaining many of its original features including a life-sized statue of Father Mathew that is still located in the tower's garden. Around 2014 the refurbished and modernized tower was sold for approximately one million pounds. For a detailed eyewitness description of the tower in the summer of 1848, see Asenath Nicholson's Annals of the Famine in Ireland in 1847, 1848 and 1849 Ulsterbooks, 2017, pp. 184\u2013193.\nNicholson also discusses Father Mathew in great detail in Annals on pp. 212\u2013214.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatholic temperance movement\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAugustine, Father (1911). \"Theobald Mathew\" .

      "name": "Charles Fort",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Charles Fort (Irish: D\u00fan Chathail) is a trace italien fortification, a bastion fort with one section of the outer wall built in star fashion. It is located on the water's edge, at the southern end of the village of Summer Cove, on Kinsale harbour, County Cork, Ireland. First completed in 1682, Charles Fort was sometimes historically referred to as the \"new fort\" - to contrast with James' Fort (the \"old fort\") which had been built on the other side of Kinsale harbour before 1607. The fort is now operated as a heritage tourism site by the Heritage Ireland arm of the Office of Public Works.\n\n\n== Construction and history ==\nCharles Fort was built on the site of an earlier stronghold known as Ringcurran Castle. The Ringcurran defences had featured prominently during the Siege of Kinsale in 1601.The new fort, which is named after Charles II, was designed by the Surveyor-general Sir William Robinson - architect of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. Additional site structures are attributed to engineer Captain Thomas Philips. The fort was built between 1677 and 1682 to a design which included elements similar to star fortifications; a layout specifically designed to resist attack by cannon. It became known as the \"new fort\" - to contrast with James' Fort (the \"old fort\") which had been built on the other side of Kinsale harbour between 1602 and 1607.With a focus on seaward defence, the landward and inland bastions of the fort are overlooked by higher ground. This weakness was of critical importance when the fort was subject to a 13-day siege in 1690 during the Williamite War in Ireland. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (then 1st Earl) besieged Cork and captured Kinsale and its forts. Repairs were made following the siege.\n\nAn early lighthouse was established here in the 17th century by Robert Reading, and additional works (including the development of internal \"citadel\" defences) were added through the 18th and 19th centuries.The fort remained in use as a British Army barracks for two hundred years afterwards, before being relinquished by British forces following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The fort fell out of use after being burned by retreating anti-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War in 1922.\n\n\n== Tourism development ==\nThe complex remained largely derelict for some time, but was named a National Monument of Ireland in 1971. Over the coming decades several sections of the fort were restored by D\u00fachas, the Irish heritage service. Restoration and development of the complex was later taken-over by the Office of Public Works (OPW) - including the development of an exhibition space in the former commander's quarters.Charles Fort is one of the most visited OPW sites in the region, attracting in excess of 86,000 visitors in 2015.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernor of Kinsale and Charles Fort\nCamden Fort Meagher - a similar coastal fortification defending Cork Harbour\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Loved the fort! Well worth a visit but the dont have any card facilities on site so make sure you go with money in your pocket. We had to leave and come back again which was annoying. Please put a sign up outside saying only cash for entry at least!",
          "What a delightful gem in Kinsale Harbour. Lots of history, lots to explore and a lot to take in. However I think it would be better to visit on a warm day rather than a windswept January afternoon. Well worth a visit with kids too but take a picnic and take your time.",

It\u2019s a fabulous example of 17th century military architecture and is a must see if you\u2019re in the Cork area! It was declared a national monument in 73 and",
          "A lot of history here but go with the guided tour, walking around by yourself is no where near as informative.",

          "It was really nice..nice room..nice view and great staff. We arrived early but are room was ready. Cant fault it in anyway. We had nice water bottles in room both still and sparkling. Also red heart shaped chocolates for birthday and card.we will be back again",
          "This seventeenth century military fort comprises extensive, well-maintained ruins in a beautiful location. It\u2019s certainly worth visiting, especially if you go on the first Wednesday of the month, as we did, when the usual \u20ac5 entrance fee is waived. It was not at all crowded",

          "This was another highlight of our trip to Ireland. The day turned warm (we'd been nearly drowned in Dublin, thanks to Hurricane Lorenzo) so it was a pleasant walk up to and through the fort. Some thoughtful neighbor left out a box of apples from their tree for the Scilly walk",

          "This fort was stunning and well worth the admission to get in. It is less touristy than many other attractions nearby. This attraction has parking and I would suggest using it. We walked all the way from downtown Kinsale to the Fort which was about an hour walk each way. The",
          "The roads into this place are NARROW and not well-marked. We were dropped here by a local tour, and so were herded though the turnstiles en masse. No comprehensive tour was offered or mentioned. We were told that a guide would give us an overview of the site, and so waited at",
          "We were able to catch one of the free tours after we got to the fort. It\u2019s a short 45 minutes walk and program but it packs a lot of information into the presentation. The grounds are vast and there is a lot left that can give you a sense of the true scale of an operation this",
          "Pleasant and knowledgeable staff. The fort is extensive but a bit derelict. It would make a great museum if fully renovated. It is still a fine monument to all those soldiers and their families who lived here for 400 years.",
          "Enjoyed the history of the fort and strolling through the ruins. The views were awesome. The coffee shop had good coffee and sweets.",
          "We dodged the showers to take at tour around Charles Fort. I can't remember our tour guides name but she was brilliant, very funny and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend getting the guided tour we had time at the end of tour walk around the fort ourselves. If you're staying in",
          "We visited here and took a guided tour of the fort. My opinion is that this is the only way to go because info about the place is scarce otherwise. There is also a nice hiking path you can take past the fort out further to the cliffs and ocean view beyond.",
          "We visited with our 1 and 3 year old and they loved it. We left the buggy in reception and found it very safe to have the kids walk around with us. They loved the look outs and the freedom of the large grass areas. It was very reasonable to enter and the kids were free. We",
          "We visited Charles Fort and I have to say it was brilliant the minute you walk into the Fort you take a step back in time we really enjoyed our visit so much history. The down side was that we had our dogs with us and they are not allowed so we had to do the tour individually.",
          "Fort built in Star fashion in 1670. British turned it over to the Irish in 1921 but it was used thru WWII. A guided tour a must. Some walls built to withstand 24 pound cannon balls. There is much climbing, steep inclines so bring your walking shoes. I think about 1/2 is",

          "This is a magnificent set of structures. The engineering was incredible and the fort stayed in tact until the 20th century. Ask the locals as to why it fell into disrepair - an interesting story. Take the walk from the city center. We took the high road on the way up and",
          "This Fort has lots of history from 1500 to 1800. We were lucky to get complimentary entry. You could spend a couple of hours here easily but we only had 1 hour to spare which was fine if you get a move on in the exhibition areas. If you are in Kinsale and have heard of the",

          "I made the walk up to the fort all the way from town. It was a lovely walk along Scilly Way, and lunch afterwards at the Bulman was fantastic. The general grounds around the fort were lovely; however, when I entered the fort, there were alarming signs everywhere that the",

          "We visited Charles Fort with our two kids in January. It was a freezing day but we all really enjoyed it. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that we arrived at the information desk to find out that they didn't take debit or visa cards so we had to go back to an ATM",
          "I was impressed by the docents and their presentations. I had no idea of the part Spain played in Ireland's history or what life was like at the fort. We braved rain, wind and hale to see the fort. It was well worth our efforts. The view of Kinsale from the fort is a bonus.",
          "Very cold day but worth the visit! Read the stories of the ww1 veterans. The star fort design was built in the late 1600\u2019s hard to imagine life then and sad the buildings were destroyed in 1922. Still worthy of your time.",

          "This was an interesting tour as it outlined the importance of the fort and the day to day life of the soldiers that were stationed there. An interesting fact is that it was built between 1677 and 1682 and used until 1922. The views are amazing!",
          "Perched above the water - a 20 minute walk from Kinsale, is Charles Fort. Very important in Irish & European history. It is easy to walk throughout the fortress for great views and a true feeling for the immensity of the site. Worth the walk. Two good Pubs enroute if you",
          "Small fee to enter the fort. You may walk around the remains of the fort as it stands today. One building holds displays in order to give some history of the fort through the ages. Lovely views of Kenmare and surrounding area.",
          "We visited with our grandchildren and had great fun! The children were hoping to find the 'fairy doors' but the kind and friendly staff at the desk told us that there is a new 'Mad Trial - Monsters and Dragons'! Everyone had a lovely time and a lovely walk in the fresh air.",
          "For a better grasp of the significance of the fort and amazing views of the Kinsale islet, take the Scilly way walk from the harbour out to Charles Fort. It's about 3-4km and the best part is where it leaves the road and the walking track follows the shoreline out towards the",

          "A bit off the beaten track, but easy to park. The fort covers a very big area of buildings and has a couple of indoor displays to do with the history of the fort and some of the people that used to live there. It was cold but not wet when we visited but you need good steady",
          "There were some brilliant views from parts of the fort and despite the rain, all parts were accessible. Unfortunately some of it was under construction but that didn\u2019t hinder the experience or the views. The man in the admissions office was very helpful, he showed us on a map",
          "The hike up to the fort was scenic and and the stop at Bulman's bar for lunch was fantastic. This is one of the best Forts we visited while in Ireland.",
          "We traveled to Kinsale for a day trip and made a stop at Charles Fort. There is an entrance fee of $5 so we decided to view from outside the gates. The surrounding views of the water and downtown Kinsale's marina were beautiful. Would be a nice stop for a packed lunch while",
          "I have been to a lot of forts in the US and other parts of the world and I was actually very pleased with this place. It is very well preserved and seems they are doing plenty of restorative work to it but without obstructing you as a tourist from viewing its full splendor. This",

          "This fort is well maintained and beautifully presented. Many of the areas of the fort are accessible and you get a good sense of what it was like to live there back in the 1600's ... not that I'd want to. You can see why it was build where it was to guard the entrance to the",

          "Walked from the town - less than 30mins easy walk, and well worth it. 2 lovely girls on reception who were more than helpful with outlining where everything was and the history is very well explained in the small museum. \u20ac4 - bargain.",
          "It is quite a walk up hill from Kinsale and a bit of a tricky drive but worth it. This fort is very intact with a lot of interesting information available about its history.",

          "You can hike here. There are hills and it is a bit strenuous. Don't believe it when they say it's 2 or 3 kilometers from town. It's SO WORTH IT. Go to the museum part first - watch the videos.Then take your time walking all throughout the fort.",
          "We took a tour and were blown away by the tour guide. He knew so much about the history of the fort and war itself. It was very informative and the hollowed out buildings and barren walls were amazing. The views from the walls of the harbour were stunning!",

          "Visited this place just outside Kinsale, memorable views and fascinating history worth a visit Denis & Sylvia",
          "Charles Fort is slowly being fixed up. You can get a feel for the layout of all the military functions. Beautiful views. If you walk to it from downtown Kinsale make sure you take the lower walking path and not the upper road.",
          "There is a shuttle service \"Local link\" that picks up from the car park next to the Kinsale Tourist Visitor Centre to Charles Fort. It makes a few local stops in the suburbs for local residents before reaching the Fort. Cost \u20ac3 return. Timings from the tourist visitor car park",

          "SO glad we took the time to go through Charles Fort with an incredibly knowledgeable guide! Hearing the history instead of just reading about it made it absolutely fascinating! Would highly recommend this!",
          "Went here with a group and noted there there was work being done to the buildings and so all of the site wasn't available to be seen, even with a paid entry. In view of this I considered that it wasn't worth the 5 euro entry fee Other than that the location and site was ok",
          "If you walk from Kinsale, I recommend taking the Scilly path that goes by the water and for a long way is without any traffic, rather than the high road. There is a long, steep hill at the end. The fort itself is worth the entry fee for the view alone, though the history is also",
          "This was part of our Ireland Tour and I wasn\u2019t too excited about it. Well, it was a very worthwhile hour and a half. The fort is situated on the coast with wonderful views. There were many tiny sailboats from a sailing school in our view. They were fun to watch. Our guide,",
          "We got here right at opening. There was a good amount of parking at that time, although it was getting full when we left. The views here are amazing, both inside and outside the fort. The fort itself is in very good condition - you can walk all around and up onto the walls. We",

          "Firstly let me say, 4 euros for senior citizen, yes worth it. But what a missed opportunity? There are infantry barracks, regiment barracks I think they were, surely one of them could have been restored to show how it was? all we had to guess by was the fire each had in the",
          "We visited this Fort on our recent Ireland trip. It was interesting to get to go inside the fort and walk around. It is outside, so dress for the weather. You can see the fort in as little as 30 minutes, but at least an hour will allow time for wandering and pictures.",
          "It's worth the quick trip and the small entry fee to see the remains of the fort. The staff does a good job giving you the history of the area and the audio visuals in demo house are good. Great spot for some very nice photos.",
          "A wonderful example of a fort with informative but not overwhelming displays and information. Walked back and forth from town it is a great walk but there are hills and it is fairly long so need to be in some shape to walk. Excellent pub near the fort with wonderful food.",

          "Charles fort fits beautifully into the area of Kinsale with its beautiful scenery. Hidden a few km from the town it does not look like much from the outside, but upon entering you realise the amount of work and history which is present here and it is also deceptively big. While",

          "Easy to drive to, great parking. Very friendly staff & because it was a Wednesday (?) it was free. The displays in the Museum and exhibition were really well-thought out, not too much and not too little. Artifacts, letters and visual. The grounds are easy to walk although",
          "We walked from town to the fort and had a nice experience visiting the fort. Good exhibits in the fort and an interesting look into the politics of the region during the time the fort was in use. Great view of the Kinsale harbor.",
          "Charles Fort seems to me to offer excellent protection for Cork Harbour. Any enemy approaching can be see clearly and long before they get there. Now, I guess the canons are not in working order, but I would still think twice before attacking that building or the surrounding",
          "A very imposing structure, extremely well maintained and with excellent exhibitions. Worth the entry fee for the view alone - its in a stunning location",
          "Walked about an hour from Kinsale to this highly recommended site. The price to enter is 5\u20ac and well worth it.

          "We arrived around 10am on a Saturday morning. After we paid the entrance fee, we saw they had a cafe with a lovely seating area, so we ordered a couple of coffees to enjoy in the morning sun. We took the tour and it was very helpful and informative. Don't miss this, it is very",
          "Be sure to take a tour is a goid exhibition centre explaining the role the fort played in Irish / English history. Very large uneven site not so good for poor walkers. Steep walk from town but decent car part. The views are stunning",
          "Nice long walk from town, nothing great, but I enjoyed it. The walk was the best part, some interesting history",
          "This ruined fort was made so much more interesting by the knowledgable and enthusiastic guide we got for our complementary tour. I learned a lot from the one-hour tour and it really brought the fort to life. The walk to the fort from the center of Kinsale was pleasant, as well.",
          "We were very lucky with the weather when we visited but I believe even without a sunny day it is a very nice place to visit. The views of the bay are amazing",

          "You get a good historic impression Some of the buildings are well restored with historic details other are kept in the origonal state. certainly worth to visit",
          "First of all, walk, if you can, to the fort from Kinsale. The walk has a couple steep hills but is such a pretty path. The fort is nice. There are displays and explanations but I really enjoyed just walking around on our own. Our 9 year old grandson loved running all over so",
          "Well preserved fort with a very long history. Great views from battlements. Nice coffee shop. They also have a monster treasure trail for young children and it\u2019s very enjoyable for both parents and children. Makes the visit more interesting.",
          "Spent a lovely morning here ;such an amazingly peaceful spot to drink in the views, even if you are not much of a history buff. Staff are really friendly and thoughtful, tea room is excellent : we sat outside, enjoying the fresh air and delicious gooseberry jam and cream on our",

          "Definitely a must do for anybody who goes to can sale we spent the day there in the rain and absolutely loved it will return sometime in the future",
          "If you've never been to a fort, and especially a \"star\" fort, this is a very informative experience. You get to walk around this place at your will and pace. Very historical and cool to think about the people that lived in a place like this so many years ago!",
          "Ireland has lots of castles and fortresses to offer, but this one is quite impressing. The ruins in combination with fantastic views on the ocean are a unique combination. And luckily for us not to many tourists, so we enjoyed this beauty in all quietness.",
          "A US choir serenaded us on our arrival. Granted, they were posing for a group photo at the time, but some things just feel pre-ordained. After that start we crossed the bridge over the moat, coughed up the paltry admission fee and started walking. First world visitors please",
          "I\u2019ve been to many forts, so am a bit particular. There are beautiful views of the Kinsale harbor and surrounding area. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The exhibits are somewhat limited and the restoration is still in progress, but it is worth a stop if you have time.",
          "We had the loveliest of walks to Charles Fort, not too demanding for my 68 yr old mum. The fort's like a photoshoot location for the teenaged nieces and their album cover. Great stuff.",
          "This was probably the highlight of my visit to Cork and it's surroundings. The walk to the fort was beautiful. The fort itself is quite interesting even though the museum is a little dated and could do with an update. The views over the surrounding landscape and ocean were",
          "The fort is in good condition and the films and displays in the building are very interesting and well done.",
          "Really very interesting and well kept. If in the area its worth a visit. We just wandered around ourselves due to having a young baby but would look for a guided tour if we visit again in the future. Really glad we went and wonderful views from the ramparts.",
          "For the history lover, there is relevant history reaching through various periods including the Williamite War when the fort was besieged for 13 days two months after the defeat of James II at the Battle of the Boyne. The fort is of classic design with appeal to all age groups.",
          "great attraction with lots of history. Guide was very good Also has great views of the harbor - I would be tempted to take a taxi up from town - but we later had an enjoyable walk DOWN to Kinsale.",
          "Views are outstanding of the water and surrounding area; interesting displays; can walk on the ruins of this fort; food available; bring your camera!",
          "A well preserved fort with an important history. There is a tour guide available at certain times of the day and we were educated on the local history of this fort by Colm. He explained all with good detail and had a great knowledge of both the history of the fort but also",
          "If you like historical sites, this is for you. The fort presents beautifully and is great to wander around. We were with young kids so couldn\u2019t avail of the tour but it sounded interesting. If in Kinsale, this is a must see",
          "Charles Fort is located on the outskirts of Kinsale. Many guidebooks say that you can walk to the fort. However, it's definitely a hike from the center of town. I would say it is maybe 2 miles possibly a bit more one way. There is signs for the trail from town if you are",
          "Toured the fort while in Kinsale for an evening and day. We enjoyed the walk up the Scilly walk up the side of the hill...lots of really pretty views of the harbor. The fort is BIG. It was great to explore the different building and learn what they were used for. A couple of",
          "I wanted a walk one morning and headed towars Charles Fort. I had no idea what a beautiful place i would find. The museum which is housed in the old Governor's house provided great history. Then, you are free to walk around the entire fort which is HUGE. Much larger than",
          "Great visit to the fort. Weather was good. Buses of people being left off for the tour. Very well priced entry for a couple of hours fun with a 10 and 3 year old (Both free). It's hard not to imagine the way it was when full of soldiers etc. Very nice day out. Lots of history",
          "We had seen impressive drone footage of Charles fort on their official website, therefore decided to stop by on our way to Killarney from Blarney castle. We took the English tour which gave us a good idea on where we wanted to come back for some good pictures. The tour itself",
          "Horrible place with lots of rude people that don\u2019t know what they are doing as when we as a family we\u2019re trying to get some food on our holiday from England where then told in every establishment that it was a private function so left us with no other choice but to stay in our",
          "This was an interesting visit. No guided tour but good informative exhibitions which explained the history well. Lovely snack cafe with homemade cake. Views of Kinsale.",
          "As part of an Ireland tour, we visited Charles Fort and was amazed on the size and location of this fort. An unique design fort for its time that guarded the entry into Kinsale harbor. The site has been maintained so everyone could see how the soldiers lived in this fort. An",
          "We took the guided tour of Charles Fort this week and learned what the lives were like for those who lived there in the 1600s. Amazing history and the fort is kept in good condition. On arrival we saw a bride using the fort as a backdrop for her wedding photos. A really lovely",
          "The views from the Charles Fort are beautiful and the history of the fort is very interesting. It is nice to walk around, see the grounds and building getting a sense of what it was like in the mid to late 1600\u2019s. It is 5 euros for adults and plenty of places for kids to run",
          "We had a lovely day to wonder around Charles Fort - and it takes a bit of walking. Absolutely huge - building started here about 1650 and was used as recently as WWI as a training facility. Some of the buildings have been restored, while other are in ruins or partial ruins.",
          "We were blessed with a warm, sunny day to explore the nooks and crannies of this impressive structure. I joked that if I had been a soldier there, they'd send me off on an errand and I'd never find my way back! There are also great views of the water and Kinsale. Glad we put it",
          "nice spot to stay and relax, close to kinsale, ticket only 5 euro , coffee shop inside as well, I recommend",
          "If you\u2019re visiting Kinsale then you should head up the hill to Charles Ford. On a good weather day the views must be fabulous! For me though, there was a lot of lovely Irish wind and rain! So I had to use my imagination. :) Nevertheless, I'm pleased I visited. Even in the bad",
          "Historic place. Huge territory. A lot of video and audio information. Suitable for families with the children, loads of space running around. Perfect when weather is nice. Cute cafe where you can get homemade cakes :-)",
          "Fascinating history and amazing that so much of the fort is still intact. We wandered around for a long time, and enjoyed a snack at the very good caf\u00e9. Definitely worth a stop.",
          "After seeing several of the older castles in Ireland (1200s), it was interesting to see a much newer but still quite old (1700s) style defense building built for cannons vs. bows and arrows. Views were incredible as it right on the tip as you enter the waterway towards Kinsale.",
          "Was not on our list of places to visit while in Ireland but was pleasantly surprised how wonderful and historic this fort was. Great find!",
          "Really interesting ruins of the fort, with detailed information and extremely helpful and knowledgeable staff on hand to tell you more about it. Additionally, the walk up to the fort from Kinsale was absolutely delightful.",
          "We walked to the fort via Scilla Walk. A lovely walk with spectacular views of Kinsale. You can stop at Bulman's Bar along the way.",
          "Very interesting to explore and the views are spectacular from the fort. Staff is friendly, engaging and professional.",
          "First tip is that OPW sites, of which this is one, has free entry on the first Wednesday of every month, so if you can tailor your trip around this great. It offer those who are a bit lazy a chance for a browse and to have a nice walk or you can delve into reading all of it's",
          "This fort is well worth a visit. It would be good to have a tour guide though; although we were given an initial overview, I think having a full tour would have added to the enjoyment. Or if they had more interpretive signs.",
          "We loved this place. It is so pristine, both the fort and the sea views. there is also a space for a picnic lunch which I think would be fun. A must see if you are in this area.",
          "From the outside just looks like a star fort. Inside lots to see and interesting tour. Worth the visit",
          "We started by taking a guided tour of the star shaped fort with Kate (our guide). She did a fantastic job of making the history of the fort come alive through interesting stories and facts. We kept our eyes peeled for the \"white lady\" that supposedly haunts the grounds. After",
          "Charles Fort - fantastic views of the bay Famous star shaped Fort - this is a great visit for anyone interested in history Great value too, kids under 12 are free",
          "I was very impressed with my visit to Charles Fort. Its a star fort that has been preserved beautiful and well worth your time to visit.",
          "Charles Fort is just an amazing site on Kinsale Harbor. The outside of the buildings is about all that is left of most of it as the interiors were made of wood and rotted a long time ago. You can almost imagine the busy barracks and the servicemen walking along the grass",
          "While staying in Kinsale and touring the southern tip of Ireland, we visited Charles Fort. A great stop on our tour of Ireland. The exhibit was modest but good and we learned quite a bit about this site from the small exhibit. Worth stopping here for an hour to se the views and",
          "Give yourself at least an hour to see all that there is. The grounds are large. It's worth seeing and it is inexpensive.",
          "I've been in a lot of forts but by far this is the largest fort \"colony\" I've ever seen. Something I learned on this trip was that our ancestors were quite savvy and thought through every detail of survival...the location of these forts were well thought out and you truly",
          "We went on a weekend to kinsale as I had heard really good things about it for a while and I was told to visit Charles fort. We didn't have much expectations but we were very impressed. The site is large, I think one of the largest ruins site I have been to in Ireland, and the",
          "I visited Charlea Fort at the end of a girls weekend in Kinsale. To start with the views from here into Kinsale Harbour and out to the Atlantic are some my favourite views of all time. Breathtaking and peaceful. So for that alone you have to take the trip from Kinsale and into",
          "A lovely place to walk off a fantastic lunch in the Bulman... Lots to see, lots to read and seems to be improving every time I visit. Just a nice place to soak up some history.",
          "Old stone fort over the harbor. Lovely grounds surrounding it. A bit of a walk from Kinsale proper but worth it.",
          "Well worth a visit. Don't let what you can see from the road deter you from going in and paying to see the whole fort. There is a lot to see. We began with a brief guided tour then strolled the grounds at our leisure.",
          "located just outside of Kinsale, it is a must see on your way out of town. A guided tour is free with admission and really gives you the history and operations of the fort. Kate was our tour guide and painted a vivid picture of what life was like. Visitors can wander most of the",
          "Not just the views but the history is also incredible. Really helpful guides and a lot of fascinating displays. Not to be missed.",
          "I booked a trip with Viator for Kinsale and West Cork it includes the Charles Fort and entrance fee was included. The ruins of Charles Fort was great and you can take a lot of picture which are instagrammable...",
          "start from kinsale , go past the harbor and through the trail along the ocean. 2 darling pubs to stop at along the way. Look for Harriet Hale, a wood worker who has a studio tucked along the path. She sells her beautiful hand carved wooden objects from her medieval seaside home",
          "Then this is the place.The fort is amazing. The sheer size is unbelievable. You can easily spend a couple of hours walking around and not see the same area twice. If you enjoy military history or just like scenic views this location is a must see.",
          "The view of and from this fort can\u2019t compare. Truly this is worth the drive even if you don\u2019t want to pay to go into the fort, it\u2019s a great stop to make if you have kids who want to run around or you just want to place to enjoy the scenery or walk around. It\u2019s a great piece of",
          "We called here on a lovely sunny day in June during a recent trip to Kinsale. I can saw the few are just amazing!! It's well worth going here for the reason alone. Nice little bit of history also, very cheap entry \u20ac5. Clean onsite toilets there is also a little coffee shop",
          "We had a nice sunny day to visit which made for a beautiful view overlooking the harbor. That alone made it worth the stop for us. Didn't have a lot of time to check it out in detail but I'm sure its also great for history buffs.",
          "Lovely walk on a pedestrian path to the fort from the B&B. We walked both ways, about 4 miles round-trip. If you want to take a cab one way, take it to the fort because it's hard to catch a cab at the location.",
          "This fort was amazing, the size alone was something to see. My husband loved walking around and the tour guides were very informative and helpful.",
          "We went for the coffee and home made cakes and visited this historic site. Great day out and fantastic value. Well worth a visit.",
          "Made the walk out to the fort from town along the water which offered beautiful views of the marina, lovely cottages and homes, and birds, birds, birds. Don\u2019t miss it if walking is your thing....it took about 40 minutes. So picturesque. Once at the Fort, we had some Irish",
          "We visited on a cold, blustery day unfortunately so we were restricted to driving from Kinsale and missed the beautiful walks. Still the views were still wonderful and the history of the fort was well-displayed and very interesting. Well worth a visit.",
          "Amazing gem! Mystical, well preserved lots of info on the tour and a great walk to it if you take the Scilly path which I highly recommend as its scenic and not too long",
          "We walked to Charles Fort from Kinsale on a beautiful, sunny May morning. They said it was a beautiful walk. It was. But, it was 1.5 miles and it was mostly uphill. That\u2019s okay. We still enjoyed it. Next time we will drive. The Fort was great. We started in building watching",
          "The fort can be reached by the Scilly walk, a 3 km walk path beside the water. The fort has partly been restored and is larger then one would imagine. The complementary tour adds to the visit.",
          "Charles Fort is a large, impressive star fort guarding the way into Kinsale. You'll want to grab a guide or at least stop in to see the video presentation on the large house-like structure to the right as you enter. In short, the fort was at least finished around 1682. It",
          "There is no better experience in Ireland for History buffs, and for landscape/architecture buffs, and for knockout vista buffs - and so on... terrific tour guides too .. hard to beat and truly impossible to rate .. (highly enough!)",
          "This is one of the few remaining \u201cStar Forts\u201d in existence today. If you\u2019re able, take the 2 1/2. Ike walk from Kinsale to the fort. It\u2019s a beautiful walk around the bay and not too challenging. The fortis very interesting and you can see a lot on your own, or with the tour",
          "We could have talked to our knowledgeable guide William for ages. He gave an excellent pr\u00e9cis if how the fort had functioned over the years and brought to life the soldiers conditions and the reasons for such huge numbers joining the army. Kinsale is now quite a touristy place",
          "A great piece of history to explore. A guide gave us a great recap of the history upon arrival. Walking around and exploring is fun. Great views of the area. They have a number of history exhibits in some buildings which were well done. Overall, worth a visit.",
          "Opposite side of the harbor from Kinsale town, but easy enough to get to, this fort is much more intact, we're told, than the James Fort. One building houses historical displays, otherwise, what's involved is mainly walking the grounds. Quaint little tea shop, great scones.",
          "First off, don't believe the tourist office in their belief that you can walk to the fort from Kinsale proper. It's only about 35 minutes walk, but the roads are really, really not pedestrian friendly. Drive or take a cab. There is plenty of parking. The Fort itself was",
          "Stopped here on our Scilly Walk around the port in Kinsale. Beautiful walk and the fort was really cool. Glad we did a guided tour as it was very informative- that is included in entrance price of only 5 euro. Well worth a stop.",
          "We were lucky enough to be there on the first Wednesday of the month which meant it was free entry. But it offers so much more than that. Fantastic scenery and great history. Really enjoyed our visit.",
          "We found the fort very interesting. It reminded me of St. Augustine Fort in Florida. The views of the bay were beautiful.",
          "We toured Charles Fort, a harbor fort built to defend Kinsale Harbor. Way back when we were planning our trip I had read the story of The White Lady and that was one more reason we wanted to visit, and put this on our itinerary. In the many months that passed I had forgotten",
          "The fort itself is a great slice of history and well worth a visit. What makes it 5* though are the staff in admissions and in the cafe. Sandwiches and cakes are also great!",
          "This was the nicest, most entact fort I have visited. It was fascinating to walk around and experience, imagining what it used to be like. Great views of the sea as well.",
          "Worth checking out if you're in Kinsale. The fort is huge! Along with great historical information, it also offers great views of the water, the countryside, and of Kinsale town in the distance. Cool place to explore for an hour!",
          "Well taken care of OPW site. Good information of the fort and nearby fort. Guided tours are available, but you can just browse at your own pace",
          "Went here with my family on a weekday. Price was reasonable, view of the water was spectacular and it entertained kids with their monster search. Would add this to any itinerary when in kinsale.",
          "Fascinating history lesson, incredible views of Kinsale. Great for the kids as there is lots of space to run around.",

          "Gorgeous day and perfect for a hike up the hill to visit this old fort. A stop for lunch along the way make it even better. Lots to see, lots of room to walk.",
          "We were in Kinsale for business with a day to spare, so took in some of the local sights. Charles Fort was a fascinating place to walk around. First impression is the scale of it - it's large, but more than that, it gives a good sense of what it must have been like for the",
          "We visited on a lovely sunny and warm day and we had a great time. There were great views and it was well worth a visit.",
          "I spent a couple of hours on a sunny afternoon walking around this large site where you could access many areas of the old fort. Beautiful vistas both within the fort and looking out into the harbor. If the visitor center had more information on exactly how the fort was used",
          "This is a two mile walk from Kinsale and is very quiet and has great views. Not many people do the walk. Ask the TI for a map and get out and see the fort. Good videos at the fort to explain the how's and whys. Very interesting and scenic.",
          "Interesting to see how the soldiers and their families lived in this fort. It has a great view of Kinsale.",
          "It was super interesting to see how the soldiers and their families lived so many years ago. So glad we took the time to visit.",
          "Charles Fort (once Moated) is situated on a hilltop above Kinsale Harbour with the city of Kinsale to the right and the Inlet to the Atlantic. Upon entering the huge star-shaped, 17th Century fort, we met our amazingly vivacious, knowledgeable, and humorous guide (see photos-I",

          "We would have loved to spend more time touring Charles Fort, but were not given the opportunity due to the nature of our tour. If we are back in the area, we will actually spend the money to get a real tour of this fort.",
          "We enjoyed a lovely walk to the fort by way of the Scilly pathway- about 45 minutes one way (some steep inclines). The Fort spreads out across this amazing strategic vantage point at the entrance to the beautiful harbor. Many of the buildings are partially destroyed , but most",
          "It is one of the more significant structures in the area and worth a look if you are nearby. The fellow who gave us a history of the place clearly loved the subject of military history",
          "Be sure to visit this site, it is very interesting and worth taking the guided tour. We enjoyed it immensely.",
          "Great place to visit if the weather cooperates. You get sweeping views of the ocean and if you're lucky a yacht might pass by and add to the view.....loads of walking involved on uneven surface so wear comfortable shoes.",
          "I recommend coming early in the morning. It\u2019s a peaceful reflective place to walk around solo. Large place to meander, great view, good exhibits to give a feel of what it was like for soldiers.",
          "Having grown up near a fort of built during the same era, I was expecting to see something I had seen many times before. I was very wrong, fort Charles is huge, impressive views make it worth a stop by itself.",
          "I've taken quite a few tour groups here. The guides are very knowledgeable and make the tour very interesting. You leave with a good feel for what it was like for those who were stationed here. It's also a great place to get beautiful pictures of Kinsale, James Fort and the",

          "Loved the site. The museum had some interesting tidbits that I had not known before. The views were amazing as well. It is a good hike from Kinsale city center but it\u2019s a lovely walk.",
          "Just outside of town on the left point is this great historical fort. Very informative presentations, lots to see and imagine life at the time of forts use. If you can, take the walkway along the water to get to the fort, taxis also available. Be sure to stop at The Bulman Pub",
          "Very interesting historical monument.we walked along the shore for our visit and thoroughly enjoyed all the visitor information",
          "This was a neat fort to explore. They let you use the bathroom for free and then we thought it looked so cool we would go ahead and purchase tickets to explore. I was questioned after going back in to pay about whether or not I had paid by a grouchy attendant and had to pull",
          "Our guide had his facts in order with examples and photos to bring events alive. There was a 20 minute or so introduction regarding the construction of Charles Fort and the players, followed by a tour of the fort and an interesting history lesson in the life of a soldier and",
          "We spent a little over an hour here, wandering the ruins. It's a beautiful, highly photogenic location. The afternoon we were there, it was nearly deserted...not sure why. This is a lovely and very affordable historic site. The interpretive materials could have been a bit",

          "A must if you are visiting Kinsale. The fort is something to see. The views, construction and history will take your breath away. Take the Scilly walk back into Kinsale. It's worth it. One pub on the way back into town too. Enjoy the Fort. It's amazing.",
          "The history surrounding this fort and the town of Kinsale, the ancient battles fought here including right up until after WW1, make this a compelling and fascinating ancient monument. There are interactive displays also on the site. Plenty of parking. It is well worth the \u20ac5",
          "We didn't have the best weather when we toured the fort; however, once we understood the history of this region it made this fort far more interesting. If you are interested in the history of Kinsale, please don't leave Charles Fort out of your tour.",
          "Took this walk on a day in March when the weather was actually clear and not too cold. Paved street all the way with beautiful homes on either side. A large pub located about midway up and another one just before you get to the fort. You have to buy a ticket to enter the fort",

          "Bit exposed up here on a cold windy day! Great historical fort well worth a fiver entrance for a walk around - if nothing else, and if you're not into culture and history, then for the view alone! At the end of the Scilly walk from Kinsale town although you can of course drive",

          "We visited here last year on a whim, we had driven to Kinsale to pass some time one Sunday afternoon. As we were leaving we say a sign for the fort and decided to go, we were greeted by a friendly chatty lady who gave us some information, tickets and a little guide. There was",
          "This was a nice stop on our March family trip. We had older folks and kids with us and all enjoyed it. A decent amount of walking as is the case with most of the historic sites but well worth it. We took great pictures of our whole family.",

          "Getting to Charles Fort from Kinsale took us along a beautiful walk past the harbour and a few lovely pubs to duck into for a drink. We weren't sure if we were going to walk through the Fort or just snap some photos from the outside but the 5 euro to get in was well worth it. We",

          "Charles Fort is in Kinsale Ireland up on the cliff overlooking Kinsale Harbour. Built in 1682 its another neat thing to visit. It was windy cold and rainy but we still enjoyed it.",
          "Charles Fort was really beautiful. So much of it was intact that you could almost imagine it as functioning Fort in its day. It was not super crowded, the views from the Fort walls were incredible. There isn\u2019t much in the way of amenities, just a cute little tea sho/gift shop.",
          "This is an interesting fort to explore with a good deal of Irish history. The exhibitions are educational and the rangers at the front gate are very helpful in answering any questions you might have.",

          "We were alone when walking through this fort so it had a magical, historic feel. The Ranger at the entrance was enthusiastic and informative.",
          "We saw a signpost that said 2 to Charles Fort from Kinsale. We're 67 but avid walkers so we set off to the fort. The scenery on the way is stunning, views back to Kinsale electric, but it was 26c and we were stunned by the mountainous trek to get to the fort. Let me say the trip",
          "The funniest thing about this place is how is was taken by Cromwell\u2019s man. Having been advised to improve its landward defences they didn\u2019t so cannon weren\u2019t on the hill above and that was that. This is a spectacular and well preserved fort of it\u2019s time. There were first all",
          "The fort was well constructted and was typical of the French star sharped design. The view from the gun battlements clearly defined its purpose",
          "I arrived just in time for the tour of the fort, it was a windy day and it helped to bring to mind how cold it must have been to be stationed here in winters gone by! The tour was well organised and the local guide explained a lot about the history of the fort and the town of",
          "Did a self guided tour of Charles Fort. It was time well spent learning about the fortification and history of the fort and how it played a major role of the area. It is a pleasant walk from Kinsale along the harbor.",
          "We arrived after hours so unfortunately we could not enter the fort. However we were able to walk on the grounds around the outside and the fort looks spectacular! You can walk on the left and right side and the sunset around that area was great.",
          "We didn't pay to go into the actual fort but walked around it in a sunday morning to clear the head and down by the water. Great visit, stunning views and good photo opportunities.",
          "road construction and parking area repair prevented late season visitation. The Fort is situated right on the water and alongside a narrow, but busy road. Road repair effectively cut off access to the fort and reconstruction of the associated car park made a visit nearly",
          "We were there before they opened for the day, so we could only walk the exterior grounds, but good Lord, it was beautiful! A great view into Kinsale Harbor set with the background of the fort that dates from the 1600s, really made for some great photos!",
          "12 acre historical fort with much history and outstanding views of Kinsale harbor and estuary. Easy walk from downtown",
          "spent a few hours just soaking in the history of the place ,worth a visit ,we went end of summer so nice and quiet.worth a look.",
          "You can rent a bicycle in town and take the quick bike ride to the fort. I really think this is the best way to do it. It's not a hard ride, and you can go on the footpath which sets a very atmospheric entry. When I went there in November (clear blue sky, sweater weather) it",
          "The biggest pleasure in going to the fort is the meandering walk to it from Kinsale, via the glaringly yellow Spaniard Pub and through Scilly (and another pub if you want to stop again...). The views across the estuary are wonderful. The Fort is massive and well preserved.",
          "Beautiful location included on the Heritage Pass. It offers great views of the water and the cove as well as glimpses of Kinsale, so it is worth bringing binoculars here. Its sprawling size and the vast number of buildings and alleyways create a good perspective of its",
          "Great place to visit. Staff gave a great overview of the site and its history. Would highly recommend. Clean toilets. Unfortunately the tea room was closed. It\u2019s a big site so lots of room to roam. Great for children to run around it.",
          "This was a substantial fort to explore and the staff were very kind and helpful. We went in a early September and there were mostly only locals walking their dogs there. Practically had the place to ourselves. Their artifact collection was very interesting.",

          "Staying in Kinsale locals recommended a walk up to the Fort especially before lunch builds up quite an appetite. Very interesting the Spanish connection & the conditions the garrison must have had to endure.",

          "We enjoyed our visit - the fort itself is very interesting, but also the views are outstanding. The historical displays were also informative.",
          "It was a fine day and the 4 of us had a walk up the hill to see Charles Fort. The Highgate was the views we got of Kinsale. The fort is worth seeing but need to research it before you go as no information up the top.",

          "Visited Charles Fort during a recent vacation to Ireland. The views were amazing on a somewhat windy, but mild October day with no rain. The Fort cost $5 euro to visit but is well worth the information provided about the history of the Fort and what it meant to the town and",
          "We went here on a cold rainy windy day. Our tour guide was very good despite the weather. Very informative. Great views. We stuck it out in the coffee shop until the rain let up. Went back out and enjoyed it more. It's pretty miserable in these conditions because it's all",

          "Good example of a star fort with lots of interpretive boards to explain usage, as well as a guide to use for self exploration. Many of the buildings are in ruin now. On a good day, I am sure you can see out to sea much further than we good on a rainy, misty day....",
          "OPW had guides that would wait for a group to gather near the entrance of the fort around a map on the ground. He then proceeded to explain the fort and much of its history. I thought that was all....but then he proceeded to point out specific locations and take us there as a",

They wouldn't allow dogs in saying that \"they would damage the historical site\" ; this building stood the test of time there is simply no reason why it would then be damaged by a small dog. Anyways where my dog cannot go with me I will refuse to go myself. Very annoyed with this!!",

Once you get inside you need to buy a ticket, usualy you can get a good guide who explains what happened with the fort in the past. A stunning arhitecture masterpiece for that time!\nI do recommend, the ticket price is low and there are a lot of parking spaces.",

        "wiki": "Camden Fort Meagher is a coastal defence fortification close to Crosshaven, County Cork, Ireland. Together with similar structures at Fort Mitchell (Spike Island), Fort Davis (Whitegate), and Templebreedy Battery (also close to Crosshaven), the fort was built to defend the mouth of Cork Harbour. Though originally constructed in the 16th century, the current structures of the fort date to the 1860s. Originally named Fort Camden and operated by the British Armed Forces, the fort (along with other Treaty Port installations) was handed-over to the Irish Defence Forces in 1938. Renamed Fort Meagher in honour of Thomas Francis Meagher, it remained an Irish military installation until 1989 when the Irish Army handed the fort over to Cork County Council. It remained largely overgrown until 2010 when a group of local volunteers began restoration and development of the fort for heritage and tourism purposes. The fort was renamed Camden Fort Meagher and is now open seasonally to visitors, with exhibits on the fort's Brennan torpedo installation (the world's first \"practical guided weapon\").\n\n\n== History ==\nThe headland known as Ram's Head overlooks the entrance to Cork Harbour \u2013 one of the world's largest natural harbours, and historically of strategic defensive and naval importance to Ireland and the region. The first harbour defences built at Ram's Head date from 1550 and were originally known as James' Battery. This fortification was extended in 1600, but fell into disuse after the Nine Years' War. The fort was reinforced in 1690 to defend Cork Harbour during the Williamite War in Ireland, but a party secretly came ashore and took the fort in an overland assault. The ports at Cork and Kinsale were later captured by forces under the Williamite Duke of Marlborough.By the Napoleonic War (1779) the defences were known as the Ram's Head Battery, and upgraded and remodelled to complement other installations at Haulbowline, Spike Island (Fort Westmoreland/Mitchell) and Whitegate (Fort Carlisle/Davis). In 1795 these fortifications were named Fort Camden for John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nBy the 1830s, Fort Camden had been reduced to a token force, and the fort was briefly repurposed as a prison. However, a Royal Commission in the 1850s gave renewed consideration to the strategic importance of the harbour, and proposed enhancements to landward defences and seaward gun batteries. This construction work started in 1861, using convict, military and civilian labour. The fort was extended during these works, with many of the site's structures being constructed underground. The current structures of the fort are attributable primarily to these works.In the 1880s and 1890s the guns were upgraded with breech-loading rifled guns, newer larger cannon were installed, a minefield was laid across the channel and a launching position was added for the \"world's first practical guided weapon\", the \"Brennan Torpedo\".During the First World War, the harbour was used as a naval base to cover the \"Western Approaches\", an anti-submarine net was added and further upgrades were applied to harbour defences. After the Irish War of Independence, under the Anglo-Irish Treaty the harbour defences remained in the control of British government. These Treaty Port installations, including Fort Camden, were handed-over to the Irish authorities in July 1938.\n\nDuring \"the Emergency\" (1939\u20131945), elements of the Coastal Defence Artillery (CDA) of the Irish Artillery Corps operated from the fort and the nearby Templebreedy Battery.The fort was later renamed Fort Meagher for Thomas Francis Meagher \u2013 who had fought in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848. (Similarly, \"Fort Westmoreland\" on Spike Island was renamed \"Fort Mitchell\", and \"Fort Carlisle\" at Whitegate was renamed \"Fort Davis\").By the mid- to late-20th century the CDA was merged into other artillery regiments of the Irish Army, and the fort was used primarily for training of Civil Defence and Reserve Defence Forces. In the 1980s the army handed-over the fort to the local civil administration authority, Cork County Council. The facility remained disused however, and became overgrown and derelict in the following decades. In 2010 Cork County Council afforded a lease to community members from Crosshaven, who instrumented a volunteer campaign to clear and redevelop the fort as a heritage tourism site.\n\n\n== Tourism development ==\n\nFrom 2010, under a \"Rescue Camden\" banner, a community group of volunteers began reclaiming and restoring Camden Fort Meagher. With input from Cork County Council, Foras \u00c1iseanna Saothair (the Training and Employment Authority), and other partners, the group began to clean, restore, develop and (ultimately) operate the fort as a tourism and heritage centre. Some of these works were covered in documentary programming by RT\u00c9. As of 2017, the fort and its surrounding 45 acre site were open visitors, but limited to weekends and bank holidays between May and September.Parts of the site have been restored for self-guided and guided tours \u2013 though several areas are not accessible to visitors with reduced mobility. A number of exhibits and installations cover the British and Irish military heritage of the fort, and the site houses one of the only resident 9/11 exhibits outside of the United States. There is a caf\u00e9 with views of the harbour mouth, and historical reenactment events are sometimes held on the parade square.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nThe features of the fort date primarily to developments in the 19th century, when \u2013 at peak \u2013 the fort had 7 officers, more than 200 men, and upwards of 20 guns.On the landward side, a ditch, ramparts, terreplein, caponier and flanking batteries defended the approaches. The casemated barracks on the north-east corner (close to the land entrance) housed the garrison and commanded the landward defences. The barracks overlooks the approach road which enters the fort on a bridge over the dry moat. A two-tiered musketry gallery and a number of flanking galleries also covered this moat \u2013 which at points is 28 feet (8.5 m) wide. Additionally a two-storied caponier had positions for landward gunners. On the ramparts, the terreplein had a number of movable cannon (supported by fixed magazines) and covered an arc of the landward approaches. In 1898, the landward defences are recorded as having four 32 pounder smooth bore breech loading guns.On the seaward side, land batteries were trained on the harbour from upper and lower batteries. The lower casemated batteries had 10 gun positions (behind shields) extending along the sea front. The upper en-barbette batteries had three guns each on the left and right batteries. In 1898 the upper batteries are recorded as having two 6-inch breech loading guns and five QF 12-pounder guns, with QF 6-pounder guns in the lower batteries.At the waterfront, a Brennan Torpedo station was constructed in the 1890s, and a second torpedo slipway was added after 1900. The fort had two piers for boat access.\nIn the centre of the fort a spiral staircase leads down from the parade ground to the vaulted main powder magazine. This main magazine is connected to the lower batteries by a tunnel. The garrison area connects to the lower batteries and piers via a zigzag path to the west. The upper batteries and parade ground also link to the lower areas via a tunnel (known as the \"bright tunnel\") to the east.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCharles Fort, a comparable coastal artillery fort defending Kinsale Harbour\nList of coastal fortifications of County Cork\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "William Rory Gallagher ( GAL-\u0259-h\u0259r; 2 March 1948 \u2013 14 June 1995) was an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer. Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s, after forming the band Taste during the late 1960s. His albums have sold over 30 million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995, but died of complications later that year in London at the age of 47.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal in 1948. His father Daniel was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board, who were constructing Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power station on the Erne River above the town. The family moved to Derry City, where his younger brother D\u00f3nal was born in 1949.His mother, Monica, and the two boys later moved to Cork, where the brothers were raised. Rory attended North Monastery School. Daniel Gallagher had played the accordion and sang with the T\u00edr Chonaill C\u00e9il\u00ed Band while in Donegal; their mother Monica was a singer and acted with the Abbey Players in Ballyshannon. The Theatre in Ballyshannon where Monica once acted is now called the Rory Gallagher Theatre.Both sons were musically inclined and encouraged by their parents to pursue music. At age nine, Gallagher received his first guitar from them. He built on his burgeoning ability on ukulele in teaching himself to play the guitar and perform at minor functions. After winning a cash prize in a talent contest when he was twelve, he bought his first guitar. Gallagher began performing in his adolescence with both his acoustic guitar, and an electric guitar. However, it was a 1961 Fender Stratocaster, which he purchased three years later for \u00a3100, that became his primary instrument and was most associated with him during his career.Gallagher was initially attracted to skiffle after hearing Lonnie Donegan on the radio. Donegan frequently covered blues and folk performers from the United States. He relied entirely on radio programs and television. Occasionally, the BBC would play some blues numbers, and he slowly found some song books for guitar, where he found the names of the actual composers of blues pieces.While still in school, playing songs by Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran, he discovered his greatest influence in Muddy Waters. He began experimenting with folk, blues, and rock music. Unable to find or afford record albums, Gallagher stayed up late to hear Radio Luxembourg and AFN where the radio brought him his only exposure to the actual songwriters and musicians whose music moved him most.\n\nInfluences he discovered, and cited as he progressed, included Woody Guthrie, Big Bill Broonzy, and Lead Belly. Singing and later using a brace for his harmonica, Gallagher taught himself to play slide guitar. Further, throughout the next few years of his musical development, Gallagher began learning to play alto saxophone, bass, mandolin, banjo, and the coral sitar with varying degrees of proficiency. By his mid-teens, he began experimenting heavily with different blues styles.Gallagher began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still a young teenager. In 1963, he joined one named Fontana, a sextet playing the popular hit songs of the day. The band toured Ireland and the United Kingdom, earning the money for the payments that were due on his Stratocaster guitar. Gallagher began to influence the band's repertoire, beginning its transition from mainstream pop music, skirting along some of Chuck Berry's songs and by 1965, he had successfully moulded Fontana into \"The Impact\", with a change in their line-up into an R&B group that played gigs in Ireland and Spain until disbanding in London. Gallagher left with the bassist Oliver Tobin and drummer to perform as a trio in Hamburg, Germany. In 1966, Gallagher returned to Ireland and, experimenting with other musicians in Cork, decided to form his own band.\n\n\n== Taste ==\n\nHaving completed a musical apprenticeship in the showbands, and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early 1960s, Gallagher formed \"The Taste\", which was later renamed simply, \"Taste\", a blues rock and R&B power trio, in 1966. Initially, the band was composed of Gallagher and two Cork musicians, Eric Kitteringham (died 2013) and Norman Damery. However, by 1968, they were replaced with two musicians from Belfast, featuring Gallagher on guitar and vocals, drummer John Wilson, and bassist Richard McCracken.Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America. Managed by Eddie Kennedy, the trio released the albums Taste and On The Boards, and two live recordings, Live Taste and Live at the Isle of Wight.The latter appeared long after the band's break-up shortly after their appearance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival.\n\n\n== Solo career ==\nAfter the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy to play on Gallagher's self-titled debut album, Rory Gallagher.It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy; the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell. The 1970s were Gallagher's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour '74. November 1971 saw the release of the album Deuce.In the same year he was voted Melody Maker's International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. However, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart, Gallagher did not attain major star status.\n\nGallagher played and recorded what he said was \"in me all the time, and not just something I turn on ...\". Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour '74, a film directed by Tony Palmer.\nDuring the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.Gallagher admitted in several interviews that there were not any international Irish acts until Van Morrison and he, and later Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy. The line-up which included Rod de'Ath on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards, performed together between 1973\u20131976. However, he eventually dropped down to just bass, guitar and drums, and his act became a power trio. Other releases from that period include Against the Grain, Calling Card, Photo-Finish, and Top Priority.In January 1975, when the Rolling Stones gathered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to continue working towards their album Black and Blue they auditioned new guitarists, to replace Mick Taylor, as they recorded. Gallagher went over for a jam with the band \"just to see what was going on,\" but did not join the group, happy with his solo career.Gerry McAvoy has stated that the Gallagher band performed several TV and radio shows across Europe, including Beat-Club in Bremen, Germany and the Old Grey Whistle Test. He recorded two \"Peel Sessions\" (both February 1973 and containing the same tracks), but only the first was broadcast. Along with Little Feat and Roger McGuinn, Gallagher performed the first Rockpalast live concert at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany in 1977.Gallagher collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Muddy Waters on their respective London Sessions in the mid-1970s. He played on Lonnie Donegan's final album.In the 1980s he continued recording, producing Jinx, Defender, and Fresh Evidence. After Fresh Evidence, he embarked on a tour of the United States. In addition he played with Box of Frogs, a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds. Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self-doubt, Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase. During this period he stated \"I agonize too much\".Notes From San Francisco, an album of unreleased studio tracks and a San Francisco 1979 concert, was released in May 2011.\n\n\n== Band line-up ==\nIn addition to Gallagher himself (on guitar and vocals), over the years Gallagher's band included:\n\n1971\u20131972: Gerry McAvoy, bass guitarist, and drummer Wilgar Campbell.\n1972\u20131978: Gerry McAvoy (bass), keyboardist Lou Martin, and drummer Rod de'Ath.\n1978\u20131981: Gerry McAvoy (bass), Ted McKenna (drums)\n1981\u20131991: Gerry McAvoy (bass), Brendan O'Neill (drums) + frequent guest: Mark Feltham (harmonica)\n1992\u20131994: David Levy (bass), Jim Leverton (keyboards), John Cooke (keyboards), Richard Newman (drums) and frequent guest Mark Feltham, on harmonica.\n\n\n== Guitars and equipment ==\n\n\n=== Stratocaster ===\n\nGallagher played a worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster (Serial Number 64351) for some years. It was reputedly the first in Ireland, and originally owned by Jim Conlon, lead guitarist in the Irish band Royal Showband. Gallagher bought it second-hand from Crowley's Music Shop of Cork's McCurtain Street in August 1963 for just under \u00a3100. Speaking about Gallagher's purchase, his brother D\u00f3nal recalled: \"His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly. This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument, it was 100 pounds. In today's money you couldn't even compare; you might as well say it was a million pounds. My mother was saying we'll be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said, 'Well, actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts, rhythm and lead, we won't need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off.' So the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like.\"Virtually all of the finish on Gallagher's Stratocaster was stripped away over time, and while he took care to keep the guitar in playable condition, Gallagher never had it restored, stating \"the less paint or varnish on a guitar, acoustic or electric, the better. The wood breathes more. But it\u2019s all psychological. I just like the sound of it\". Gallagher's brother D\u00f3nal has also stated that, owing to his rare blood type, Gallagher's sweat was unusually acidic, acting to prematurely age the instrument's paintwork.The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher. The tuning pegs and the nut were replaced, the latter interchanged a number of times. The pickguard was also changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring \u2013 Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way type.In late October 2011, D\u00f3nal Gallagher brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Bonamassa opened both night's performances with his rendition of \"Cradle Rock\" using Gallagher's Stratocaster.\n\n\n=== Other equipment ===\n\nThough known for his Stratocaster, Gallagher also used a number of other guitars, including acoustic examples, during his career. In April 2014 one of the last guitars owned by Gallagher, a custom-built Patrick Eggle 'JS Berlin Legend', was sold at auction in England for \u00a325,000.Gallagher also used a number of models of amplifiers during his career, generally preferring smaller 'combo' amplifiers to more powerful 'stacks' popular with rock and hard rock guitarists. To make up for the relative lack of power on stage, he would link several different combo amps together.When Gallagher was with Taste, he used a single Vox AC30 with a Dallas Rangemaster treble booster plugged into the 'normal' input. Gallagher also used an Ibanez Tube Screamer, and several Boss effects, including a flanger.In the 1970s, Gallagher began to use Fender amplifiers with a Hawk booster. Later in the 1970s, when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound, he experimented with Ampeg VT40 and VT22 amplifiers, and also used Marshall combos.Gallagher was an early adopter of Boss ME-5 all-in-one floor based effects units, and used such a unit for his live work up until his death in the mid-1990s. He also used Stramp 2100a amplifiers, which can be seen in his appearances on the German Beat Club program. Another company that built amplifiers for Gallagher was PCL Vintage Amp.\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn the later years of his life, Gallagher developed a phobia of flying. To overcome this, he was prescribed various drugs. By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the Netherlands, he was visibly ill with severe abdominal pain and the tour had to be cancelled. He was prescribed paracetamol for the pain, a drug that can be extremely harmful to the liver, especially with a heavy drinker such as Gallagher.Gallagher was admitted to London's King's College Hospital in March 1995, and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent; his liver was failing and the doctors determined that, in spite of his young age, a liver transplant was the only possible course of action. After thirteen weeks in intensive care, while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home, his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a staphylococcal (MRSA) infection, and he died on 14 June 1995, at the age of 47. He was unmarried and had no children.\nGallagher's body was buried in St Oliver's Cemetery, on the Clash Road just outside Ballincollig near Cork City, Ireland. The grave's headstone is in the image of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of the Year.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2003, Wheels Within Wheels, a collection of acoustic tracks, was released posthumously by Gallagher's brother Donal. Collaborators on this album included Bert Jansch, Martin Carthy, The Dubliners, Spanish flamenco guitarist Juan Martin and Lonnie Donegan.\nMany modern day musicians, including The Edge from U2, Slash of Guns N' Roses, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Davy Knowles, Janick Gers of Iron Maiden, Alex Lifeson of Rush, James Dean Bradfield of Manic Street Preachers, Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest, Vivian Campbell of Def Leppard, Gary Moore, Joe Bonamassa, cite Gallagher as an inspiration in their formative musical years.\nBrian May, lead guitarist of Queen, relates: \"so these couple of kids come up, who's me and my mate, and say 'How do you get your sound Mr Gallagher?' and he sits and tells us. So I owe Rory Gallagher my sound.\" In 2010, Gallagher was ranked No. 42 on Gibson.com's List of their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time. Gallagher was also listed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, at 57th place.In April 2014, at the time of the auction of Gallagher's Patrick Eggle 'JS Berlin Legend' guitar, the BBC noted: \"Eric Clapton credited him with \u2018getting me back into the blues\u2019. The Rolling Stones wanted him to replace Mick Taylor and when Jimi Hendrix was asked how it felt to be the world's greatest guitarist, he is reported to have said: \u2018I don't know, go ask Rory Gallagher\u2019\" (but this may be a variant of an urban legend ).\n\n\n=== Tributes ===\n\nOn 25 October 1997 a tribute sculpture to Gallagher was unveiled in the newly renamed Rory Gallagher Place (formerly St. Paul's St. Square) in his hometown of Cork. The sculptor, Geraldine Creedon, was a childhood friend of Gallagher.\nRory Gallagher Corner, at Meeting House Square in Dublin's Temple Bar, is marked with a full-size bronze representation of his Stratocaster. Some of those who attended the unveiling included The Edge of U2 and the Lord Mayor of Dublin.\nIn 2004 the Rory Gallagher Music Library was opened in Cork.\nIn 2006 a plaque was unveiled at the Ulster Hall in Belfast.\nA street in Ris-Orangis, a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, was renamed Rue Rory Gallagher.\nNew York City-based Celtic rock band Black 47 paid tribute to Rory Gallagher on their 1996 release, \"Green Suede Shoes\". The track titled \"Rory\" features vocalist and guitarist Larry Kirwan delivering a tribute to Gallagher.\nFlynn Amps manufacture a Rory Gallagher signature Hawk pedal, cloned from Gallagher's 1970s pedal.\nChristy Moore released a song on his 2009 album Listen titled 'Rory is Gone', which pays tribute to Gallagher's life.\nOn 2 June 2010, a life-sized bronze statue of Gallagher, made by Scottish sculptor David Annand, was unveiled in the town centre of Ballyshannon. An award-winning annual blues festival is held in his honour in the same town.\nIn 2015 Fender produced the Rory Gallagher Signature Stratocaster.\nIn October 2016 approval was given to put up a statue of Gallagher on Bedford Street, near Ulster Hall in Belfast.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nRory Gallagher \u2013 1971\nDeuce \u2013 1971\nLive in Europe \u2013 1972\nBlueprint \u2013 1973\nTattoo \u2013 1973\nIrish Tour '74 \u2013 1974\nAgainst the Grain \u2013 1975 Rolling Stone review at the Wayback Machine (archived 1 October 2009)\nCalling Card \u2013 1976  Rolling Stone review at the Wayback Machine (archived 1 October 2009)\nPhoto-Finish \u2013 1978\nTop Priority \u2013 1979\nStage Struck \u2013 1980\nJinx \u2013 1982\nDefender \u2013 1987\nFresh Evidence \u2013 1990\nNotes from San Francisco \u2013 2011 (posthumous double-album of unreleased recordings from 1977 and live performances in San Francisco from 1979 )\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of people on stamps of Ireland (2002)\nList of blues musicians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Rory Gallagher website\nRory Live \u2013 using a BOSS ME-5 into a cranked VOX AC30\nRory Gallagher at Curlie",

          "Had a lovely day out today with my two little girls 5 and 3. They had a ball. Two lambs followed them around the farm and kids didn\u2019t stop smiling the entire time they were. Love the new wooden playground and the new slide! The baby pigs were a bit hit with the kids, not to",
          "I visited the farm for the first time recently and was very upset and concerned at the way alot of the animals are kept (raccoon looked so depressed and his enclosure is totally inadequate), the marmosets enclosure was at the back of a small stable housed with lots of rabbits",
          "Visited the farm today with two friends and left feeling sad concerned for the welfare of the animals. There was a calf at the start which actually appeared to be sedated and totally unresponsive. There was a mouse in one enclosure being eaten by the other mice in with it.",
          "Spent the day her with my wife and 18mo daughter. Some of the animals are in areas that are a little bit small for their species type. Birds of prey having about 5m X 5m which is crazy, they could barely open their wings. Racoon dogs looked depressed and didn't move for 20",
          "I visited Rumleys Farm during the Easter holidays with my cousin and our young children. Many of the animal enclosures smelled very overpowering and many offered very little light to the animals contained within. There was one coatimundi in an inclosure alone with very little to",
          "We held a birthday party here last Sunday for our 5 year old and it was absolutely fantastic. They were incredibly helpful and great with the kids. All the kids and adults had an absolute blast it was very special. I would highly recommend it.",
          "We visited here back in December on a day when the kids got to see Santa. I have to say it was a great day out and a great experience for the kids. They absolutely loved it. They loved being able to get up close and personal with the animals without compromising the adults",
          "It would be a nice family day out! Mostly out doors so would be best for a dry day. Little unfinished but was also the start of the season. Animals were all gorgeous but the Newfoundland dogs are just amazing!",
          "If you cate at all about animals and animal welfare please do not go to this farm. Animal living conditions and what they are being fed are disgraceful putting it mildly. I don\u2019t know how they are allowed to continue in business!!",
          "We took our 2-year old to this 'working farm' but left with concerns about the welfare of the more exotic animals in particular. The enclosures seemed very small with no stimulation for many of the animals, and most of the birds as well as the meerkats and the racoon dogs looked",
          "Visited recently with a new born and 2 small kids. The staff member that took care of us was so nice, gina I think her name was. The farm itself is great for small ones. In need of a bit of repair but overall a lovely time was had. We had toasted sandwiches and they use real",
          "Great for parents and children of all ages. The farm is like a mini zoo and staff are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.",
          "Rumley farm is a working farm, but it is not just farm animals, they have birds, monkeys, , tractor rides, robotic milking parlour, play area, ride on children tractors, bikes. zip wire, climbing frames, , both indoor and outdoor. they also cater for Birthday parties. great food",
          "I have been to Rumleys a few times over the last few months and can honestly say that it really is getting better and better..they are really trying to make it a whole family experience and not just for the kids..my 2 girls aged 5 and 3 love going there. There is so much to do",
          "I usually rate places like this based on how our children relate to the venue. So from that perspective, they were happy enough, although they did think some areas were a bit rough and badly managed. They loved the petting area and liked seeing the varied birds and other",
          "Went on a trip yesterday to Rumley's Open Farm with our cousins as it was my sons birthday. Group included 4 adults, 4 teenagers, a 4 year old and a 9 yr old. We had a lovely lunch in the caf\u00e9, the catering staff were most obliging and helpful. We enjoyed our time there",
          "Visited here with my family last October. Could do with being tidied up a bit. Looked a bit dated. And in need of refurbishment. But saying that it is one of the better open farms that I have been to.",
          "It was with a heavy heart we walked around the enclosures, witnessing the dirt and squealer the animals lived in. Especially the feral goat hiding in the corner of a shed at the top of the farm. His eyes appeared deranged, head down ready to attack, he was loose I may add. My",
          "Been here many times and they are adding to the adventure but its not at the standard it needs to be. The place needs tender loving care even from initial parking....unsure what was floating in holes on foot golf but not good. Some of go katts dont work and pitch and putt area",
          "We had a great day in Rumleys with 3 children, 5, 4 and 2 years old. The petting sessions were a winner with them , the tractor ride and a variety of playgrounds. Everything is within walking distance , at not too much of a stretch. An outdoor picnic area would be a good idea",
          "Farm was brilliant, animals were looked after well, all of them had loads of water in the heat. Cafe was brilliant and the staff were the most friendly and most helpful people I've met. 10/10 would recommend",
          "Nice to visit and walk around, but a bit expensive and needs to be better maintained, The Animals need to be a bit better cared for too! Theres also dogs running around which were quite hyperactive and a could be intimidating for people uncomfortable around dogs!",
          "We went only today with our 2 grandchildren so we were a party of 4 adults and 2 children.To start off the colorful birds at the entrance to the farm were pooing onto the entrance hallway quiet dangerous with small children .We all felt the place was very run down like it was",
          "Went as a school tour in May. Our guide was just so brilliant, patient and amazing with the children. When we went on the tractor ride around the farm we saw this calf with a chain around its neck and the chain was nailed to a small free standing shed (like a big dog house).",
          "Kids loved this as did we. We were here for hours. It is also a working farm and they have a milking parlour that you can go into,very interesting. They hv pitch n putt, go carts, loads of animals and a big indoor play area. Great coffee too.",
          "I went here in May 2018 with my kids aged 5 and 8 and they loved it! The kids especially loved the cheeky Macaws (one who said 'Go to bed' all the time) and the meercats at the entrance. The opportunity to pet baby chicks, guinea pigs and little puppies went down a treat too.",
          "Went as a couple without kids. It was quite small (top area closed off due to flood damage) and we had finished the park in about 30mins. We thought it was quite run down and unkempt. Still an enjoyable enough activity if you have a free afternoon. Have heard many positive",
          "visited Rumleys with grandchildren and loved the experience.the children loved all the different aspects of farm animals and the tour of the farm while the adults relaxed in the restaurant..with teas and coffees readily available but expensive,",
          "This was our second trip to Rumley's for the Winter Wonderland and Santa visit and it was just as good as the last time. This Santa visit is the best value as you get a lovely Christmas experience including a snow shower and all the fun on the farm too. Spent a lovely two hours",
          "Big wide open farm with decent set of animals and birds along with karting tracks for kids, ideal for outside play with weather providing, both indoor and outdoor games and play as well. Electronic machine milking of Cows was interesting to see.",
          "A family of four went for a day. Had lunch in the cafe. Slightly below average food for slightly above average prices. Grand! General feeling of grubbiness in the cafe. Kids enjoyed the indoor and outdoor play area. Loved the crazy golf and the go carts. Obviously seeing the",
          "Went to Rumleys on monday not expecting much as I had read a lot of negative reviews. We were only going there as it was on our way. We were so glad we did as it was great. Rumleys has a massive variety of animals and plenty other activities like zip line , crazy golf ( which is",
          "I visited Rumleys yesterday with my 3 kids, my sister and a friend with her 2 kids and we were all very impressed especially the kids! They had absolute ball, the sand pit was a huge hit with the boys, not to mention the tractor ride, both the indoor and outdoor play areas, the",
          "Very disappointed with my visit this year. Thought there might have been some improvements since last year. I know the weather is warm but the water troughs could have contained clean water. Others were bone dry. Grass areas very overgrown ... a lot of clearing up to be done.",
          "Absolutely loved all the animals - especially the little donkey and goat. What a friendly welcome from the 2 big black dogs. They are just fab! Great place to take the kids or go for a stroll. Lovely coffee shop also. Will definitely be back.",
          "First visit this year. Big improvement on the indoor play area. My kids do love the place however I often feel like it is a bit rough and ready (I don't feel it is as safe as other open farms as there are often exposed wires, trip hazards and sharp concrete edges). Also the",
          "Really enjoyed our visit, lots of animals, baby cows, baby rabbits, a little puppy, goats meerkats, baby pigs - we got to rub the pigs belly and he loved it \ud83d\ude0a lots of birds to feed too",
          "Was in cork on holidays with family, went to the farm along with the kids. One of this had an assistant dog with them so we rang ahead to make sure it was ok to bring her to which we were told no problem. When we got there we decided to grab a bite to eat while waiting on others",
          "Would not recommend it to anyone. Rang in advance to ask if it was okay to bring my brothers assistant dog and they said it was fine. Got there with my 3 year old niece and 11 year old cousin and decided to have lunch before going in. Our assistant dog was sitting quietly under",
          "We took our grandchildren today. It was \u20ac34 to visit and inside we also paid \u20ac1.50 per person to go on a great Tractor Ride and \u20ac2.00 for the smallies to try the mini excavator. There is plenty of variety from pigs to parrots, ducks to donkeys. Children also enjoyed the tracks",
          "I was here last year a few times and was never entirely happy with it. So when I read that it had been refurbished I was hoping for improvement. They invested in a bigger indoor play area and that was probably about it. Baring in mind this is a farm, you would hope for some",
          "We visited the farm on Easter Monday. \u20ac34 for two adults, a 4 and 2 yr old is expensive. I was surprised to hear that it is newly refurbished as it doesn't look finished. I am not an animal activist but I thought the ostrich looked distressed and one of the large pigs had a cut",
          "I visited Rumley's farm yesterday, Easter Monday having heard that they were holding an Easter egg hunt. I went with my nieces and nephew and they had great fun, received lots of eggs, lollipops and jellies and there were dressed up Easter characters interacting with everyone. I",
          "I visited Rumley's farm today, easter Monday. I have a Fota wildlife membership card so I usually go there but I had heard about the Easter egg hunt here so decided to pay the entry fee & try Rumley's farm. What a fantastic day we had! The Easter egg hunts were fantastic, they",
          "It's disappointing that I can't rate this 0! The place is shockingly bad. If you are thinking of going here then I strongly suggest that you go to Leahys Open Farm instead. Having been to both in 48 hours, there is no comparison. Considering that this place has only just",
          "I visited Rumleys yesterday for the first time since it reopened 3 weeks ago, I was expecting huge improvements but instead I found it to be filthy dirty, I know it's a farm but the indoor area was actually disgusting. The new play area is a great extra but it's overshadowed by",
          "I had my little girl's 3rd birthday party here last week and everything about the experience was positive, largely thanks to all the lovely staff. The guys who guided us around the farm were enthusiastic and so encouraging and patient with the little ones while interacting with",
          "Had a fantastic time here with my 2 year old. Loved that it's a real working farm and she was able to see real life. She adored the new play area and getting up close to the animals.",
          "Poorly staffed in restaurant. (30 minute wait for food) Restaurant was cold, coffee was cold, dirty tables and floors in restaurant. Indoor play a disgrace: Cold, miserable and absolutely filthy dirty. 3 sets of tables and chairs in indoor play. Sat on a dirty sticky leather",
          "I visited the farm with my husband and 2 year old daughter with the particular intention of using the indoor play area. I was appalled to see that it was absolutely filthy. The idea that they had a back door leading everybody who visited the farm to the main entrance was",
          "I have bought season tickets for two years running to Rumley's. I have 4 children that range in age from 17 - 6 and they all enjoy coming here for a day out. This is a family run farm and you really get a sense of this as soon as you enter, all the staff are welcoming and",
          "I took a group of 20 school going children here on school tour. The children loved the day. fab trip on tractor & trailer. Lots of room indoor and outdoor for play. The only fault we had was the time frame for lunch and space was not big enough. As you know you cannot time",
          "Located just south of Cork city off the N27 Rumley's provides a great opportunity for kids to have hand-on interaction with farm animals as well as many other exhibits. Good play park.",
          "Well the first thing that hits you is the price to enter, i nearly dropped when i heard and from there on it was only ok . For the animals some badly needed a bigger pen and cleanliness was a major problem but i let that slide till i got round to the milking parlour and it",
          "myself and my wife love rumbleys farm. the entry fee is very reasonable and there is a great walk around the whole farm. Surprisingly the farm is huge and with kids you could easily spend several hours. we are from the city ourselves and love animals and this is our local",
          "I went to Rumleys with my daughters and two grandchildren for what we thought would be a pleasant afternoon ... this wasn't the case !! I was absolutely appalled at the condition nearly all the animals were in .. they were neglected and filthy and as an animal lover I felt so",
          "Me and my boyfriend went here on a date it was the most fun. We had lovely weather thank God but the moment we got their a very friendly genuine staff member greeted us. The reception / shop is terrific. There is beautiful customers toilets on entry which usually pet farms",
          "Came with my family and was unlike anything we have ever been to! A very open feel! You get a hands on experience! They do a quality job at Rumley's Open Farm and I applaud their commitment to these beautiful animals! Not to mention the amazing Newfie dogs that greet you Miley &",
          "This is a must to visit if you are in the area. Amazing open farm that has it all. Farm, wild and exotic animals, good selection of all of them. Indoor and outdoor play areas, mini golf, zip wire, karts, etc (all included in the \u20ac8 entry fee). Add a big and comfy coffee shop,",
          "We visited here with 6 small children, there was plenty to do including soft play, park, go karts and indoor sand pit, as well as the animals! Lots of animals to see and the petting barn was lovely, the kids stroked cats, dogs, rabbits, lamb and chicks and thought it was great.",
          "I went to Rumleys farm on Saturday wit my family. I was not impressed at all everytin is too spread out there was no staff to help wit any queries no one to help my son gain access to mini digger the one they had. the tractor and trailer went once wile we were there and had the",

          "nice couple of hours entertainment for younger kids. Nothing too exciting happening here with cows/sheet/pigs/unexpected camel/lamas etc. Couple of playgrounds and a nice tractor/train ride for 20 mins. Lovely cafe at the beginning/end with lots of variety. not too expensive and",

          "the kids loved the farm as there is a lot to do for under 10s. There is a great variety of animals and thoroughly enjoyed the tractor ride. We stopped for coffee and cake afterwards. There is a great variety of homemade cakes which are very yummy! Definitely worth a visit for he",
          "As someone who is involved in and concerned with animal welfare, I was appalled by the way animals here are kept. I've had 'professional' dealings with them before (professional is in inverted commas since it was hardly handled as such on their end) but this particular time",
          "The name is a farm but it is more like a mini zoo. Well worth the \u00a38 paid cos the weather today was windy and sunny. There are quite a few animals to see and pat. Good place to visit if you are in Cork.",
          "I really thought there would be more animals you could actually pet! Maybe it's my own fault, I always thought Rumleys was a petting farm of sorts but other than a pretty awkward stretch over a wall to get at near some piglets, I was a bit sad about how few animals I got near.",
          "Even on a rainy day the kids loved this even though it's an outdoor event. Animals were interesting, tractor ride funny. More for under 10 years of age",
          "A very quick view during the afternoon. The Place is nice and you can see several animals (it is good for children). The cages have enough space for some of them even if they seem to be very thirsty in general.",
          "I visited Rumleys open farm on a lovely sunny day over the weekend. From beginning to end the trip was most enjoyable. The tractor ride led by Jean was very enjoyable she was very informative and ensured all the children were having a good day. The food in the cafe was very",

          "Went to Rumleys Farm yesterday, got there around 12, and the kids had a fab time. They got to get up close with lots of animals, and went on a tractor ride. The automatic milking machine is very clever too. I guess the weather was on our side and if it was wet it would not be so",
          "Don't waste your money. Go to Leahy's open farm. Rumley's to me is all about the money not a bit about animal welfare. Common to see dead birds, dead chickens, the wolf/dogs are always hard to see in their little enclosure. Wouldn't recommend Rumley's.",
          "My Husband and I brought our two grandchildren to Rumley's Open Farm. It was a great day out for us all. It was great to see the reaction of our granchildren when they got up close to the animals. There is a nice playground for the children and a little cafe which we really",

          "Fab day out whether you have kids or not. You can get up close with some of the animals and there is plenty of play areas for the kids. I would suggest packing a picnic though as it can be pricey to eat on top of the admission prices.",

          "We got a gift voucher to go here. Had visited about 3 years ago and enjoyed it when it was simply an open farm with farm animals and loved it. Now they have wolf dogs in an enclosure that's way too small, racoons in a shoddy pen, and marmoset monkeys in a fairly small cage.",
          "We visited Rumleys Farm recently as my sister and niece were visiting Cork from England. We've been once before about 2 years ago, but I found that it had deteriorated a lot since then and overall the experience was pretty disappointing! There's a general feeling that the farm",
          "Well I knew about this place last year or two. But newer manage to go. So last weekend we did. It's close to Cork and very easy to find! You can find them on FB or their website. The price for 2 adults and 2 children 30 euro. There is deal for everyone. Single 8euro. There is",
          "Rumley's Open Farm is a great place to bring your family on a day out! The staff here are extremely friendly and always have time to talk to you. It is layed out beautifully. The animals are well taken care of and are you know that there is alot of time gone into looking after",
          "If you love animals and birds go to Rumley's Open Farm. From wooly pigs to massive dogs, meerkats to parrots they have a great selection of farm animals and more. Take a leisurely stroll around on a fine day and you'll leave at peace with nature It has something for everyone.",
          "Spent an hour or two here with the kids and wife as the day was good and fancied a day out. Very disappointing to be fair they have a great idea but it delivers very little. Our kids are very interested in animals but we're not impressed with the horrible conditions some of the",

          "I really question what this farm is trying to achieve. I totally supporter farmers making an alternative income but I have major welfare concerns. Some of the animals have dirty small cages. There isn't adequate shelter from the sun and rain. Less exotic animals please and more",
          "This is our second time been at Rumley's. Once when it opened up a few years back and back then we did not like it because we taught it was fairly cruel to the animals and the conditions they were kept in. We said that we would try it again as we were giving them the benefit of",

          "We are just back from a visit at Rumleys Open Farm. We arrived at 2pm and did not leave the farm till 6pm. Never a boring moment, best day out we've spent in a long time. Our 2 1/2 year was kept busy by some fantastic play areas on site. There is a lovely play ground suitable",
          "We live in West Cork and I have four children under 11 and it was very hard to choose a place on a Sunday evening where they would all love especially my youngest son whom is five. Then we found Rumleys ....FANTASTIC .... my children will do anything now from going to bed on",
          "The best day out I have has out with my kids :) spent 4 hours there , kids already want to go back !! With great staff , Brillant facilities , couldn't recommend it more !! Can't wait to go back , a must for everyone of all ages . I have 2 teenages and a toddler and they all",
          "I recently visited the farm with my brother, niece and nephew. The farm is a short drive outside cork city. We has an enjoyable day, I was impressed with the range of animals including alpaca and water buffalo. The kids play area is a nice feature on the way in and serves",
          "I brought my grandchildren to Rumleys expecting the usual farm animals. To my great surprise, there was an amazing range of animals from Czech wolves to African Water Buffalo to Giant Owls. It was like another Fota Wildlife Park! Spoke to some of the staff who were very friendly",
          "It's all about the money and profit making. The animal welfare comes second to that. Sickening. To those unfamiliar with correct animal standards, it may seem good. But many of the animals are regularly in poor environments and handled unsuitably. Not for the true o real animal",
          "Had a great day at Rumleys farm ! Got a lovely welcome from lady at the reception. Would recommend for family day out ! Very reasonably priced ! Lots of lovely animals and was great to be able to feed them :-) Hope they keep up the great work",
          "My philosophy in life is if you want to do something - do it right. Management at Rumleys Open Farm, clearly would not concur with this sensible philosophy. From the moment I paid the entrance fee for two adults and 1 three year old I had a very uncomfortable feeling about",
          "My niece had her first birthday party last Saturday at Rumley's farm. Everyone had a really great day, I would definitely recommend it for a children's birthday party as there is something for all age groups, from the indoor play area to the excellent outdoor activities,",
          "Rumleys farm is lovely, it has something for absolutely everyone and was something badly needed in Cork. There is loads for children to do inside and out, so even on an absolutely washed out day there is an inside play area, an inside sand pit, some animals that can be viewed in",
          "As we remember our trip to Ireland, Rumley's is one of our favorite memories. The staff there is so wonderful in all ways. We were there on Halloween and our little girl was dressed in a Little Bo Peep costume and was looking for her sheep. The staff was so friendly and",
          "Love this place! Just been to see the new sheep pig!!! Funniest looking pig I've seen. Hubby was dying to come down to see it after reading all about it in the papers. Staff were brilliant telling us about how the pig came to Rumleys. Then into the cafe for a nice cuppa & cake",
          "Myself my husband and three chrildren went to Rumbleys farm 4christmas. My 10 year old said it was his favourite part of Xmas this year and my two girls age 9 and 6 agreed. We have been to see a lot of santas over the years but this has by far offered the most for my money. A",
          "Our family and an other family had a very enjoyable trip to see Santa at Rumleys this Christmas 2013. It was very wet when we arrived, therefore it was quiet with no queues. The elves, Mrs Claus & Santa were lovely. The presents were the best we've got in the last 8 years of",
          "Went to Rumley's farm on the 22nd December with 4 kids & 2 adults. I felt it was so rushed they were trying to get rid of us before the major crowd came. I didn't think much of mrs. claus a bit of dough to play with that about a 100 kids had played with before us. She gave no",
          "I visited Rumleys today , very disappointing overall . Disorganised and Santa could have been ruined for my kids. The only saving grace was that THE SANTA was great . Lacked atmosphere , over priced for what is provided. Shame on the owners of RUMLEYs .",
          "I visited Rumleys over the weekend with my 3 children to see santa. I have to say I was disgusted with what I saw in terms of animal welfare, I am a veterinarian so I do know what I am talking about. I saw animals locked up in small enclosures (camels, Lemurs, two beautiful new",
          "I had been there on a previous visit and found it good, and thought this would really be great for kids at Xmas. How I got it so wrong! They were totally disorganized from the get go. I got a family pass which cost me \u20ac56 and was told that for a photo with Santa it would be an",
          "We went to see Santa, lovely experience. Go karting, indoor and outdoor play areas, tractor ride, wonderful range of animals, exotic and farm, water buffalo gorgeous, so affectionate! Our second visit, previously on a school tour, will definitely be back.",

          "I have been giving honest reviews on Tripadvisor for a long time and this is the first time I feel compelled to mention a previous review. On a recent visit to Rumley's Open Farm with two girls aged 5 & 9 yrs we had the best time. It's a beautiful setting with really friendly",
          "This really was a very disappointing visit and I regret to say I could not recommend it. I visited with my 2 daughters, their cousin and my sister in law. The place was completely disorganised and really didn't have any festive feel to it. Santa, The Elves and Mrs Claus were",
          "This attraction is still young and still being worked on, so take no notice of what others say about it. My wife and i have been there twice now and we will go again next year when we go back to Ireland. It is a good day out and there is over 20 acres to wander around. There is",
          "I visited the Open farm with toddlers and teens perhaps a lethal combination but amazingly both groups got an amazing amount from the visit. But I go too fast. Rumleys Open Farm is a wonderland jsutoutside of Cork and provides an amazing mix of entertainment for all kids and",
          "Such a shame as this place could be fantastic, if they looked after their small animals better. Friendly welcome, Brilliant restaurant and shop, then you go outside; 2 hours we walked around and saw no staff, It was upsetting for the kids seeing one concrete enclosure after",
          "Appalling. small dog type runs for all birds regardless of size, requirements. all filthy, barren, disgusting. I saw some small primates kept in what looked like bird cages, more filth, being fed what looked like rusks for children. Animals in cages in freezing sheds, i cant",
          "It's an amazing place worth visiting. I went there few weeks ago and was positively surprised by how nice the place is. You could easily spend a whole day at the farm....",
          "Why do farmers feel the need to show exotic animals when seeing farm animals would be enough? Otters particularly and birds kept in the most depressing conditions I've ever seen including rotting food and faeces left out. Not a member of staff in site. Birds in concrete cages",
          "My wife and I stopped by Rumley's, had a look around the farm shop (stocked with so many delicious fresh foods) and ate a lovely lunch in the restaurant, tasty and served with a smile. But then we decided to have a look around the farm and were astonished at how extensive it is.",
          "I really enjoyed my day at the farm with my nieces and nephew.it was hard to get them home.the whole day was great and they were kept well entertained from start to finish.My only fault with the place is having dogs locked up even though for my nieces it was their main",

          "Went on a summers day with my one year old. Wanted to show her all the farm animals and as this is quite near our home we decided to give it a go. I didn't enjoy my trip here at all. It is a nice set up but I do have to question why there are so so many birds and exotic",
          "Shocked at the appalling conditions that some of these animals are kept. The Rumley's clearly know nothing about the husbandry of these non-indigenous species. They would be better served to stick to what they know which are traditional farm animals. When you go to a farm you do",
          "Its a lovely large open farm with many different animals. Its being upgraded and provides a nice home for all the animals. Has a lovely playground for the kids. The food in the on site restaurant is both reasonably priced and produced fresh from their own farm. The staff are",
          "If you want to see lots of animals in acceptable living conditions then this is a great place to go for a day with the family. We spent a whole day and then went over to the Resturtant on site for refreshments. The open farm is fabulous. While The staff were all lovely and",
          "Went here with our two & half yr old and ahead of going heard that this place was expensive but charging \u20ac8 for everyone over the age of 2 makes Rumleys disappointing. I have to agree with some of the other reviews already posted. Parts of the farm are very run down or even give",
          "We came away from Rumleys Farm actually very sad. The intentions , I'm sure, are good. However, the care, environment and understanding of the needs of the animals is just dreadful, in parts. The birds are in such a small enclosure which stinks..... A poor parrot on his own",
          "A fascinating day out with two young boys. An intriguing mixture of domestic and exotic animals and birds. Also a mixture of activities for the young ones. Overall the attraction while basically attractive, lacks maintenance and organization. Almost every activity had items",
          "We visited Rumleys farm with our two year old one saturday in July. It was quite large, with lots of animals to see. Although at times it felt more zoo-like than farm-like. Lemurs and camels, lots of species of exotic birds in cages. Overall we felt the cages seemed very small",
          "Spent three hours here today with two grandsons. Very well thought out, as we could play inside during torrential showers. The boys loved it! Especially the zip line. There was no problem with anybody monopolising it(as with previous review). The signs are very clear. I was",

          "I finally went to Rumleys Open Farm after hearing and reading rave reviews. I hate to say I was most disappointed! As a former veterinary nurse I was appalled to see even the most basic animal husbandry was absent... An enclosure with 5/6 Angus calves, 1 Ostrich, a couple of",

          "This place really surprised me. I went there expecting to see a few hens and a maybe a sheep. We got about half way round and I had to go back to the car to get food. There are many outdoor animal enclosures and play areas. A good few under cover places with sand, ball pit",

          "This place should get shut down. I am so sorry for all the animals kept in too small cages, with nothing to do. Doesn't apply to cattle and goats etc, but cats? Wolves? Foxes, \"secured\" with an electric fence? It is just bad.",

          "Good place to look and play with kids ",
          "Kids loved it. Some new recent additions like pirate ship and football golf and pitch and putt but the latter need more work. Good day out and spent a good few hours here",
          "Hard to get around with stroller on some areas, but besides that it's a very accessible place. The children loved it. There's a restaurant, bathrooms and sinks for the children to wash their hands just outside the restaurant area. There is \u2026",

          "Great place for kids to run and have close contact with animal at their level. Pets corner a great hit. Recommended",
          "Awesome place to visit and see all the animals.",
          "I thought the hens were overcrowded.also there was a few kittens there .to be honest they seemed to be a bit thin and other members of my family thought the same.Adults should definitely be there when handling the kittens as they are small.a bit pricey.46 euro for 3 adults and two kids",

We all absolutely loved it!!\nExpect to spend the day walking around as there is so many animals to see and lots for the kids to do  More then just farm animals. \n\nI would give 5 stars but i do believe it could be made more wheelchair view friendly.",

          "Animals have no clean water place looks run down wont be returning not child friendly either.",

        "wiki": "Ballincollig (Irish: Baile an Chollaigh) is a suburban town within the administrative area of Cork city in Ireland. It is located on the western side of Cork city, beside the River Lee on the R608 regional road. In 2016 it was the largest town in County Cork, at which time the Ballincollig Electoral Division had a population of 18,621 people. The nearest towns include Ballinora, Carrigrohane, Kilnaglory, Ovens, Killumney, Inniscarra, Blarney, and Tower. It is located beyond the green belt from the suburbs of Bishopstown and Wilton. Ballincollig is within the Cork North-West D\u00e1il constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Barrett family (after whom the barony which contains Ballincollig is named) built Ballincollig Castle during the reign of Edward III.  The castle was taken from Andrew Barrett by rebels in 1641, but they were expelled by English Parliamentary forces under Murrough O'Brien, Earl Inchiquinn, in 1645. It was garrisoned for James II in 1689, during the Williamite war in Ireland, then remained unoccupied after his defeat, and fell into decay.\nThe Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills were opened in 1794 by Charles Henry Leslie, a prominent Cork businessman. Eleven years later, the mills were bought by the British, who were preparing for war with Napoleon, and the barracks were built to protect the supply of gunpowder. It was one of the largest gunpowder mills in the British Isles. In 1837, the mill employed several hundred workers, and by 1880, Ballincollig was one of the largest industrial establishments in Cork, with the mill employing many men and boys from the area.\nWith the closure of the Gunpowder Mills in the early 1900s, Ballincollig became little more than a small village on the road from Cork city to the larger market town of Macroom. The 3rd Royal Munster Fusiliers (Reserve) Battalion were stationed there during the Great War. Other Regiments stationed in the Barracks before it was decommissioned were 1st Field Artillery Regiment and 8th Field Artillery Regiment (FC\u00c1). The recently decommissioned Murphy Barracks was a major source of employment. In the 1970s, Ballincollig developed as much more of a satellite town, with many housing developments constructed around the old village, and housing people who worked in Cork city or its suburbs. This expansion continued through the late 80s and 90s. Consequently, the town's population has risen dramatically, particularly with the westward expansion of the town. Ballincollig has grown to be largest town in the county.\n\n\n== Churches ==\nTwo Catholic churches are located in the town. The modern 'Church of Christ Our Light' (designed by a local architectural firm) is located on the west side of the town, while the old 'Church of St Mary and St John' is located near the centre of the town, on Station Road.The Bible Baptist Church meets in the Westgate Foundation on the west end of town. The church is associated with the Cork Bible Institute and other Gospel ministries.Other religious groups including Hindus, Sikhs, and Greek Orthodox also have services at various locations in Ballincollig.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2011 census, Ballincollig was 87% Catholic, 7% other religions, 5% no religion, with 1% not stated. Ethnically, the town is 83% white Irish, 10% other white, 3% black, 2% Asian, 1% other, and 1% not stated.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\nThe amenities located in Ballincollig include a library, a multiplex cinema, playgrounds, shopping centres and the Ballincollig Regional Park.\nThe recreational park, Ballincollig Regional Park, includes the former gunpowder mill and measures approximately 135 acres (55 hectares), with 52 structures in varying stages of decay surviving from the gunpowder manufacturing process. The site is approximately 2.4 kilometres in length and the River Lee runs the northern length of the site. The site contains a system of canals used during the manufacturing process connecting all the process areas in a single flat system without locks. The canals are fed from the River Lee at the western end of the site. The park contains soccer pitches, a rugby pitch, walkways, a skateboard facility, and free-to-use outdoor fitness equipment - the latter installed on the park's western end in November 2011. As a result of a 2012 development plan, which outlined the future of the Regional Park by the Recreation & Amenity section of the local authority, planning was approved for multi-use games areas and a children's playground. This work started  December 2014 and is now completed. An eighty plot allotment scheme was also identified within the development plan, and was opened in November 2013 at the Innishmore entrance to the Regional Park. A series of marked trails were laid-out in 2014, and consist of four looped walks, colour-coded according to length. The Military Trail begins at the Shopping Centre Square and continues to the Regional Park by a westerly route. Three other trails of varying lengths begin and end at the western end of the park - at Inniscarra Bridge.\n\nThere is also another playground near the Lidl on the western side of the town.\nBallincollig is home to several cr\u00e8ches, four primary schools, and two secondary schools. The two secondary schools in Ballincollig are Col\u00e1iste Choilm and Ballincollig Community School. Ballincollig Community School is located in West Ballincollig and is next to the 'Church of Christ Our Light' and Scoil Barra (a primary school). Col\u00e1iste Choilm is located in East Ballincollig and is near a doctor's practice and the town centre of Ballincollig. Scoil Eoin and Scoil Mhuire (two primary schools) are located near St Mary's and St John's church. A new three-storey building was opened for Gaelscoil U\u00ed Riord\u00e1in in 2012. This is one of two primary and secondary Gaelscoileanna (Irish-speaking schools) in the area, providing for a large number of pupils who learn through the Irish language in the area. It is one the eastern side of the town.There are a number of shops along the main street, as well as a shopping center, Tesco and two Topaz refueling locations. In addition to restaurants and caf\u00e9s, there are many take-away restaurants including traditional \"chip shops\", Chinese, Indian, halal, and others.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\nThe Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills along with its visitor centre / museum is to be found on the north side of the town. Some buildings in the Gunpowder Mills are now in disrepair but the area is still open to walkers in the Regional Park.\nThe grave of Rory Gallagher is located at St Oliver's Cemetery, on the Model Farm Road, just outside Ballincollig. His headstone is a replica of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of The Year.\nThe Coolroe Lime Kiln is an example of the historic quarrying in the Coolroe area of the town.\n\n\n== Shops ==\nLarge retailers in Ballincollig including a Dunnes, a Lidl, two Aldis, a Mace (Maxol), a Tesco and two Supervalus. There is also Castle West Shopping Centre, which has outlets of Cummins, Hickeys Pharmacy, Art N Hobby, and Carphone Warehouse. On Wednesday, a weekly farmers market is held at the shopping center, normally in front of the main street-side entrance.\n\n\n== Transport & communications ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Cork to Macroom rail line served Station House (at the south end of Station Road).\nBallincollig railway station was opened on 12 May 1866, closed to passenger traffic on 1 July 1935, closed to goods traffic on 10 March 1947 and finally closed altogether on 1 December 1953.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\nBallincollig is served by a number of Bus \u00c9ireann bus routes. These include route 220 (to Carrigaline, via UCC, Cork City Centre, and Douglas), route 220X, (similar route via the Lee Fields rather than Bishopstown), and route 233 (Cork City Centre to Macroom via Ballincollig). \nA number of proposals, such as the 'Project Ireland 2040' transport plan, include a potential feasibility study into a possible suburban light rail project in the area.\n\n\n=== Road ===\nBallincollig was situated on the N22 from Cork to Tralee. A bypass around the town was opened in September 2004, which resulted in reduced journey times from Cork to Killarney on the N22 and reduced traffic volumes through the town centre. The N40 starts on the eastern side of the town that continues as the Cork southern bypass. The N40 and N22 both share exit 1.\nThe former alignment of the N22 is now the R608 regional road which goes through the town centre.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe nearest airport is Cork Airport which is about 14 km away.\n\n\n== Clubs and sport ==\nNotable sports clubs in the town include: Ballincollig GAA Club and Ballincollig RFC. Mycro Sportsgear, which manufactures equipment for hurling, is based in Ballincollig.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nMick Mannock, recipient of the Victoria Cross has connections to Ballincollig\nHorace de Vere Cole, prankster and organiser of the 1910 Dreadnought hoax\nSanita Pu\u0161pure, world rowing champion\n\n\n== See also ==\nMetropolitan Cork\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Kinsale (; Irish: Cionn tS\u00e1ile, meaning \"head of the brine\") is a historic port and fishing town in County Cork, Ireland, which also has significant military history. Located approximately 25 km (16 mi) south of Cork City on the southeast coast near the Old Head of Kinsale, it is located at the mouth of the River Bandon. Its population was 5,281 at the 2016 census. Its population increases during the summer months, when the tourist season is at its peak and the boating fraternity and other tourist visitors arrive in numbers. Kinsale is in the Cork South-West (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann) constituency, which has three seats.\nKinsale is a holiday destination for both Irish and overseas tourists. \nLeisure activities include yachting, sea angling, and golf. The town also has several art galleries, and there is a large yachting marina close to the town centre.\nThe town is known for its restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Bastion restaurant, and holds a number of annual gourmet food festivals.Historical buildings in the town include St. Multose's Church (Church of Ireland) of 1190, St. John the Baptist (Catholic) of 1839, the Market House of c.\u20091600, and the so-called French Prison (or Desmond Castle, associated with the Earls of Desmond) of c.\u20091500. Charles Fort, a partly restored star fort of 1677, is in nearby Summercove.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1333, under a charter granted by King Edward III of England, the Corporation of Kinsale was established to undertake local government in the town. The corporation existed for over 500 years until the passing of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, when local government in Kinsale was transferred to the town commissioners who had been elected in the town since 1828. These Town Commissioners became the Kinsale Council under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and the Kinsale Town Council existed until 2014 when this layer of local government was abolished in Ireland as part of measures to reduce the budget deficit following the financial crisis of 2008\u20132010 (see Post-2008 Irish economic downturn). It returned two members to the Irish House of Commons prior to its abolition in 1800.\nIn its history, Kinsale has also important occasional links with Spain.  In 1518 Archduke Ferdinand, later Emperor Ferdinand I, paid an unscheduled visit to the town, during which one of his staff wrote a remarkable account of its inhabitants.\n\nIn 1601, a Spanish military expedition \u2013 the last of the Armadas launched against the Kingdom of England \u2013 landed in Kinsale in order to link with Irish rebel forces and attack England through Ireland. As a result, the battle of Kinsale took place at the end of the Nine Years War in which English forces, led by Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, defeated the rebel Irish force, led by Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone and Red Hugh O'Donnell, two Gaelic princes from Ulster. The Irish forces were allied with the forces of King Felipe III of Spain, who was also King of Portugal and the Algarves. In September 1607, a few years after this battle, the Flight of the Earls took place from Rathmullan in County Donegal in West Ulster in which a number of the native Irish aristocrats, including both Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, abandoned their lands and fled to Continental Europe. Shortly after the battle, James's Fort was built to protect the harbour.\nIn 1649, Prince Rupert of the Rhine declared Charles II as King of England, Scotland and Ireland at St Multose's Church in Kinsale upon hearing of the execution of Charles I in London by Parliamentarian forces during the English Civil War.Charles Fort, located at Summer Cove and dating from 1677 in the reign of Charles II, is a bastion-fort that guards the entrance to Kinsale Harbour. It was built to protect the area and specifically the harbour from use by the French and Spanish in the event of a landing in Ireland. James's Fort, which dates from the reign of King James VI and I, is located on the other side of the cove, on the Castlepark peninsula. An underwater chain used to be strung between the two forts across the harbour mouth during times of war to scuttle enemy shipping by ripping the bottoms out of incoming vessels.\nKing James II and VII (he was King James II of England and Ireland and King James VII of Scots) landed at Kinsale in March 1689 with a force of 2,500 men, raised with the support of King Louis XIV, as part of his campaign to regain power in England, Scotland and Ireland. In 1690, James II and VII returned to exile in France from Kinsale, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne by William III of England (also Stadtholder William III of the House of Orange-Nassau) after the 'Glorious Revolution' (or Revolution of 1688) in England against the background of wars involving France under King Louis XIV.\nFrom 1694 Kinsale served as a supply base for Royal Navy vessels in southern Ireland, and a number of storehouses were built; it was limited to smaller vessels, however, due to the sandbar at the mouth of the river. English navigator and privateer Captain Woodes Roger mentions Kinsale in the memoir of his 1708 expedition from Cork; in particular he mentions a pair of rocks known as 'the Sovereigne's Bollacks' on which his ship almost ran aground. Kinsale's naval significance declined after the Royal Navy moved its victualling centre from Kinsale to Cork harbour in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars in the period of France's First Empire.\n\nIn 1848, New York Unitarian minister William Steven Balch and his close friend Frederick C. Havemeyer sailed to Ireland and disembarked initially at Kinsale. Balch leaves a long and detailed description of Famine Kinsale in the first few chapters of his travel memoir Ireland as I saw it, which was published in 1850.\nWhen the ocean liner RMS Lusitania was sunk by a U-boat of the German Empire on 7 May 1915 on a voyage from New York City to Liverpool during the First World War, some of the bodies and survivors were brought to Kinsale and the subsequent inquest on the bodies recovered was held in the town's courthouse. A statue in the harbour commemorates the effort.  The Lusitania memorial is at Casement Square in Cobh, to the east of Cork city.\nKinsale was linked by a branch line via Farrangalway and Ballymartle to the Irish railway system of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway and its successors from 1863 until 1931, when the branch was closed by the Great Southern Railways during a low point in Kinsale's economic fortunes.  The station, inconveniently located for the town and harbour, was on Barrack Hill and the line ran to a junction at Crossbarry on the Cork (Albert Quay) to Bandon line.In 2005, Kinsale became Ireland's second Fair Trade Town, with Clonakilty being the first.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nBus \u00c9ireann provides Kinsale's primary means of public transport. Buses regularly operate from Kinsale to Cork City, with most of these stopping at Cork Airport on the way.  Kinsale and Bandon are linked by public transport with a bus service provided by East Cork Rural Transport.\nThe Archdeacon Duggan Bridge on the R600 road to the south-west of the town was opened in March 1977, named after Father Tom Duggan MC OBE and latterly a staunch nationalist and a missionary priest in Peru.  This bridge replaced an older cast iron structure of the early 1880s which was located approximately 3km upstream on the River Bandon, near Tisaxon More.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are a number of primary and secondary level schools in the area. The town's community school was awarded \"Best School in the Republic of Ireland\" twice, as well as receiving awards at the BT Young Scientist Exhibition in 2014.Kinsale College offers a number of further education courses, and the town also has a school of English.\n\n\n== Community and sports groups ==\nKinsale Yacht Club (KYC) began in 1950 and today is a sailing club that runs events for all ages of sailor and social activities throughout the year. Junior sailing includes Optimists, Lasers and 420's. The yacht classes include Squib (keelboat), International Dragon (keelboat) and A-Class Catamaran as well as three Cruiser Classes (Class I, II and III).Founded in 1982, the grounds of Kinsale Rugby Football Club are used for the annual Kinsale Sevens event - which attracts international teams and thousands of spectators annually.The Kinsale GAA club plays in the Carrigdhoun division of Cork GAA. They won the Cork Football Intermediate County Championship in 2011, the first time since 1915.\nKinsale Badminton club which is affiliated with Badminton Ireland is based in St Multose Hall Kinsale. It caters for both adult and juvenile players and enters teams in Cork county Leagues and Cups.\nThe Kinsale Branch of the Irish Red Cross has been in existence since 1939 and is staffed by volunteers, who are present at local events and activities \u2013 including the annual Kinsale Sevens rugby event. The Kinsale Red Cross has 2 ambulances which are housed in a purpose built building in Church Lane and crewed by trained volunteers.\nKinsale competes in the Irish Tidy Towns Competition and was the overall winner in 1986.Kinsale is the first 'Transition Town' in Ireland, and the Transition Town community organisation, supported by Kinsale town council, holds meetings locally. It has taken some guidance from the Kinsale Energy Descent Action Plan 2021, which has spawned further Transition Towns worldwide.\n\n\n== Entertainment and culture ==\n\nKinsale hosts an annual jazz festival, which takes place during the last weekend of October. Pubs and hotels in the town host concerts by jazz and blues groups throughout the weekend, including on the last Monday of October (which is a bank holiday in Ireland).The monumental steel, originally unpainted, sculpture The Great Wall of Kinsale, by Eilis O'Connell and installed in 1988 to celebrate Kinsale's achievements in the Tidy Towns competition, stands by Pier Road and Town Park.Bastion, a restaurant on Market/Main streets, received a Michelin Star in 2020. Chef Keith Floyd was previously a resident of Kinsale.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\nThe town forms part of the Bandon-Kinsale electoral district on Cork County Council and is part of the Cork South-West constituency for D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann elections.\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nKinsale is twinned with:\n\nNewport, Rhode Island, United States\nMumbles, Wales\n Portofino, Italy\n Antibes, France\n\n\n== Development ==\nResidential developments in the 21st century include the Convent Garden scheme near the historic centre. This development involves the conversion of the former St Josephs Convent of the Sisters of Mercy on Ramparts Lane into 79 apartments and the building of 94 houses in the grounds. After several years of inactivity, construction and sales activity recommenced in 2015 and 2016.A further residential development, Abbey Fort, includes 260 units at the north end of Kinsale. Initial phases were completed in 2007\u20132012. Part of the 22 acre site at Abbey Fort was sold by the National Asset Management Agency in December 2015.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2011 census, ethnically Kinsale was 76.5% White Irish, 18.5% other white, 0.5% black, 1% Asian, 1% 'other', with 2.5% not stated. In terms of religion, the 2011 census captured a population that was 76% Catholic, 10% other stated religions (mainly Protestant), 11% with no religion, and 3% not stated.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nAchilles Daunt (1832\u20131878), Church of Ireland clergyman; born in Kinsale\nAidan Higgins (1927\u20132015), poet and novelist; lived in Kinsale\nAisling Judge (b.1991), scientist and winner of the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.

          "We visited on the 23rd of July and were delighted with the experience we had! The Old Cork Waterworks is a Victorian Waterworks located right on the River Lee. You get a great overview of the history of the Waterworks and their impact on Cork in the 19th century. Our tour",
          "The \u2018exhibits\u2019 were incredibly underwhelming, dull and boring and mostly damaged! Bits broken off and scratched off everywhere! It gave the impression no one cared about the place and The play park for kids was partially closed as a hazard! Would not reccomend!",
          "I visited Cork\u2019s old Waterworks museum expecting to see some old steam pumps and some history on the works. The museum was much more than this, with interactive displays showing how each part of the waterworks worked, the importance of the building to the city up to recent times",
          "Spent a significant amount of time speaking with one of the directors of the museum. He was so informative and gave us a great history lesson on the Waterworks and its place in relation to the history of Cork and Ireland. Even recommended other places for us to visit in Cork.",
          "Nice history and good staff willing to share the story of the waterworks, but the exhibits themselves are a bit short on detail. Some lovely handmade miniature steam engines on display also.",
          "Highly recommend a visit. Beautiful machinery, well preserved and presented. Lovely Victorian building, lovely design, lovely engineering. We had a great guide in Shazia, who was informative, helpful and friendly. And gave a great recommendation for a coffee nearby, as the",
          "Loved the fact that old machinery in today's terms helped shape what we do today. The guide was he Paul and intuitive to what we were interested in",
          "It's fun and interesting. I went there on multiple school tours, but sometimes it can get a little boring.",
          "Well worth a visit to have a snack and coffee while taking in a tour of the old water pumping systems.",
          "Very interesting little place on a lovely site, kids loved the glass elevator. Really educational for the kids, they loved finding all the info for the sheets and asked lots of question about water, energy and waste and what they could do to help the world! Job done lifetime",
          "We first visited the lifetime lab last summer and had a wonderful time. It made sense to revisit and see what has changed. We were not disappointed! My son loves learning and experiencing a hands on approach, the lifetime lab provides this and more. There are interactive",
          "I would not recommend lifetime lab for a family day out. I was told by the girl on the phone that it would take an hour to an hour and a half but in reality it only took a half an hour to go around.",
          "went there on a visit with young children found nothing of interest left after a short time ande a lot to be desired toilets leav",
          "This is really good place for the kids to go. Check the opening hours however as they're not so user friendly for families with kids at school.",
          "Quite educational in an Eco / energy saving way but not a lot to do unless you go on a mid term break when they usually try to add a little something extra. When we attended they had a lot of owls visiting that the kids could hold and learn all about. A small playground on site.",
          "This is the best preserved Victorian waterworks in Britain and Ireland! The reason being, that it was built on a very steep hill side that was very suited to the engineering requirements of the waterworks but not much use for anything else and when it closed its doors 40 years",
          "The exhibits are well put together, and the outdoor playground is very good. Well worth stopping in for a while. Cafe is limited to drinks and snacks, it's not a fully fledged restaurant. Entry price is very reasonable for a family. The quiz (with small prizes) is a good way to",
          "We were really looking forward to visiting this 'attraction' but found it utterly underwhelming. There is very little to see and the interactive exhibition is not well maintained. The over all impression is of something that's seen better days with bits missing, parts not",
          "Very interesting and lovely with kids. There's a lot to see, a lot to do and the building is very interesting. For me as someone with an interest in old industrial buildings it is a must see. It also has a playground for children and coffee and lovely scones.",
          "as my nephew gets older he enjoys this lovely attraction even more getting lots more out of it. Even I learn something at the interactive exhibition. Great to see old buildings and a piece of Corks heritage restored. The engine room is always a source of interest and then of",
          "This is a wonderful attraction which informs about the environment and also has an interactive history of the Waterworks which engages the children. Their are interactive activities to educate about the environment. Their is a sensory garden and playground to help to burn off",
          "We attended the Easter Egg hunt on Good Friday. Enjoyed the questionnaire for the kids to complete to receive their prize at then end, although quite a few of the exhibits were cramped with the number of attendees. You did need to arrive before 1400 before any selections were",
          "The building's history is interesting. The clipboard activity is perfect to help kids understand the exhibits. Wonderful environment to demonstrate the importance of eco friendly energy.",
          "We went for my sons 5th birthday outing while in Cork and he had a blast! when you buy your tickets the children get a little quiz that they have to take around the lab in search of the answers. My little ones loved the hands on learning and were very interested in the displays.",
          "This is a great visit for eco aware parents with eco aware kids, or anyone of an historical/architectural disposition. Interactive exhibits on the site of the old city Waterworks where the river Lee enters the city. Coffee shop for those who ...",
          "It's not often I consider a museum to be poor verging on terrible but Lifetime Lab - you've won the award for taking a good idea and doing a whole lot of nothing with it. You're situated in a wonderful piece of Victoriana but could have done so much with the site. The Lab's",
          "Expected alot more interaction and input by staff. They sat behind the counter while we went around ourselves. We thought there would be some experiments or displays by the staff but all we did was push some buttons and levers. Kids got more enjoyment from the playground",
          "This is one of the true gems of Cork. Though aimed at schoolgoers, the displays are good enough to be of interest to all ages. Step outside the building for a sweeping view of the River Lee, and the 18th century Cork City Water Works. Parking available.",
          "very child friendly, eco mindfulness, clever and the outdoor area is great for picnics there are often special family events there including puppet theatres and such.",
          "I visited this with my sons who are 6 and 8. The 8 year old really enjoyed it and could recall a lot of what he'd seen. There was a lot of information I needed to read out to my younger son, so he lost interest a bit. The playground was very good. It was easy to find and good",
          "Good value, for the price worth a visit if your children are aged 6- 12. free car parking on the left straight across road.",
          "not open at the weekend. thats when we first went and were very dissapointed. went back during the week, didnt pay to go in as there were no staff to be found. glad we didnt as i would have asked for a refund. dirty toilets and not much to interest the kids.",
          "a great way to learn . a very old museum-like building on the outside but very modern and futuristic interesting space on the inside. Learn about the stars, filtering our drinking water among other details of modern life in a fun interactive way.",
          "Well-restored old buildings of the original waterworks. Good effort at environmental awareness displays. Visit if you're passing, not really worth a trip. Small caf\u00e9/snack bar. Parking difficult - you probably need to drive west a bit to get a space in another car-park on the",
          "The lifetime lab makes learning about Science fun for kids. It makes them aware about energy and science in their everyday lives.",
          "I had fun learning the things but I have one complaint : none of the information was written in French, Spanish or any other language other than English and cork has been getting a lot of tourism ! also when we tried the buttons and things some of them didnt even work! But I did",
          "this was a nice way to spend an afternoon with small kids. very interesting and educational and the playground was an added bonus for the kids. it was informative and fun. the price at 7 for 2 adults and 2 kids was extraordinarily good value on the down side it does need a",
          "I thought it unusual to see a Victorian working pumping station here on this holiday - interactive stuff and great for kids too. Nice River location.",
          "Went there during engineers week this year, nice place interesting exhibits good play ground up the top coffee shop also more for older kids but our two below 5 both enjoyed it",
          "My children get taken their by their school and have always enjoyed the experience",
          "great day out for family of all ages my husband especially liked the little digger in the playground!",
          "Found this a great afternoon trip for the kids.From an educational perspective I found it more suitable for maybe 8/9 years + as there was quite a bit of reading involved. The outside construction /activity section was very entertaining. The restaurant was of a poor quality with",
          "great activities for kids,they became environmental detectives,solving puzzles based around the interactive exhibits and won a trip to the lovely onsite playground as a reward for all their hardwork.A family ticket is just \u20ac7,unbeliveable value as we spent 2 hours there."

        "wiki": "Douglas (Irish: D\u00faglas or D\u00fabhglas, meaning \"dark stream\") is a village and suburb contained within Cork city, Ireland and the name given to the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland and Civil parish in which it is contained. Originally a village, the growth of both the village and the city has meant Douglas has become incorporated into the city over time. The 2017 Mackinnon Report proposed that Douglas and surrounding residential areas be moved to within an extended Cork city boundary, ending the division of Douglas between the city and county administrative areas. This was approved by the Cabinet on 6 June 2018, with Douglas and surrounding areas Rochestown, Grange and Frankfield to move into the city council area following the 2019 local elections. This change occurred on 31 May 2019, ending the divide between the separated halves of Douglas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThere are a number of extant or proposed prehistoric sites in Douglas and the surrounding area, including a shell midden, ringforts, souterrains, and a fulacht fiadh. Further evidence of prehistoric settlement in the area includes the finding of a Bronze Age decorated beaten gold disc in the townland of Castletreasure; although reputed to be related to the ruined castle of the same name, it has actually been dated to 2500-2000 BC.\n\n\n=== Origins (13th-17th century) ===\nDouglas was first mentioned in an inquisition on the lands of Gerald de Prendergast in 1251, and in a 1291 taxation document which records the lands as being an appurtenance of the Church of Bauvier. It is alternately listed as \"Duffelglasse\" and \"Duglasse\" in 1302 and 1306, respectively, as part of the parish of Carrigaline. In the year 1603, it became one of the liberties of Cork City. In 1615, parochial records mention the chapel of Douglas being laid waste, reportedly due to theft of the foundation stones, and in a 1700 entry of the same records it is mentioned that the ruined chapel in question had been the church of the Carrigaline parish for a century prior to the construction of a new church in Carrigaline. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms.\n\n\n=== Linen industry (18th-19th century) ===\nThe area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of the \"Douglas factory\" in 1726, reported in August 1755 to be the property of \"Messrs. Perry, Carleton and Co.\", with 100 looms initially operational. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the Royal Navy, amongst other clients. The industry was established by Huguenot weavers and textile workers, such as the Besnards, who acquired the Mills by 1783 and in 1801 installed the first powered spindles in Ireland, along with skilled workers from Ulster and Scotland. In addition to the mill workers, employees included over 1,000 spinners working from their houses, and hacklers, bleachers and labourers tasked with preparing raw material in Douglas village.\n \nFurther textile mills opened in the nineteenth century, including an additional Besnard-owned scutching mill (Ravensdale, 1806), Lane\u2019s Corn and Hemp Mills (now Douglas Community Park, 1845), O\u2019Brien\u2019s Brothers (St Patrick\u2019s Woollen Mills, 1882), Donnybrook Mills (Wallis & Pollock Flax Mills, 1866; re-opened as Morroghs' Woolen Mills, 1889/1890) and Conroy\u2019s Rope and Twine Mills (now Galway's Lane, 1892). Most of the mills ceased to operate in the early twentieth century, although St. Patrick's Woollen Mills and Donnybrook Mills continued to operate until the 1970s. Some of the houses built for the mill workers are still in existence, including a terrace of houses near the junction of the Grange Road and Donnybrook Hill.Other large businesses of the time included an Osiery beside Conroy's Mills, two large brick manufacturers which straddled the nearby estuary, the Ravensdale Flour Mill, and the Woodville Flour Mill which was situated south of the Rochestown train station and produced sea biscuits and ship bread.Douglas developed as a suburban area throughout the later eighteenth century and the nineteenth century, and was noted for the high concentration of 'big houses'. The popularity of the area among the nobility was such that elevated prices were commanded for the surrounding lands, and as a result, the acreage of the estates was lower than average. The oldest house was believed to have been Ronayne's Court, built in 1627 by Morris Ronayne; although the house was demolished in 1969, the original inscribed fireplace was moved to Blackrock Castle. The nearby Montfieldstown House was reputed to be the inspiration for Havisham House of Dickens' Great Expectations, having been abandoned following a ruined wedding. Bloomfield House was connected to a notorious libel case between the prominent Cork Pike and Beamish families, in which the judge, who ruled in favour of Pike in Pike v Beamish, was given the house upon announcement of the verdict by the mother of the plaintiff. Windsor House was occupied by Lord Bandon, Sir Abraham Sutton and the Kiltegan Fathers, before being redeveloped as the Rochestown Park Hotel. Ballybrack House was occupied by the Lane family, also of Vernon Mount, and is the birthplace of art dealer Sir Hugh Lane. It received frequent visits from Lady Gregory, a close relation of the family. High Court, built in 1720 and later known as Westgrove, was the birthplace of playwright and Abbey director Lennox Robinson. Grange House was home of the Conron family, descended from Sir Christopher Hatton, for over 300 years. Douglas Hall, one of the few remaining examples of a slate-fronted house in Ireland, was home to Rev. Dr. Francis Moylan, Bishop of Cork, who was made a freeman for his rhetorical opposition to the French invasion at Bantry Bay during the 1798 Rebellion. Vernon Mount, which was built for a wealthy merchant family in the late 18th century, was occupied by Sir Henry Browne Hayes, who was sentenced to penal servitude in Botany Bay after attempting to abduct an heiress for forced marriage. Other prominent Big Houses included Ravenscourt House, Old Court, Norwood Court, Ballybrack House, Donnybrook House, Montpelier House, Grange Erin, Castletreasure House, Bellvue House, Tramore House (home of the philanthropic Reeves family), and Maryborough House (now the Maryborough House Hotel, with an earlier late-17th century lodge).Douglas was made a separate Roman Catholic parish sometime before 1768. St. Columba\u2019s (Roman Catholic) church was built in 1814 by the Rev. Thomas Barry, according to local legend using the stones of the ruined castle of Castletreasure. A Douglas \"Chapel of Ease\" to the Church of Ireland parish of Carrigaline was established on 17 September 1786, with the establishment of a full separate parish in February 1875. In 1855, the Protestant population of the parish was reported as having been 310, with 150 children attending the parish school. The 1785 church was rebuilt and reconsecrated on 27 August 1875 as St. Luke\u2019s church, however, following the death of the resident Canon in 1886, as well as the principal architect, the church remained without a spire until 1889, with the church bell and tower clock donated by Mary Reeves of Tramore House, with the stipulation that the clock face towards her front door. Notable parishioners interred at St. Luke's include the poet Richard Alfred Milliken and librarian Richard Caulfield; in addition, a plaque was erected in the memory of art collector Sir Hugh Lane, deceased in the sinking of the Lusitania. The nearby parish of St. Finbar's opened a chapel of ease in Frankfield in 1838, later known as the Holy Trinity, on ground donated by Samuel Lane. An additional graveyard, located on Carr's Hill, was opened in 1848 on land donated by the Master of the Workhouse, George Carr, to deal with the increase in deaths from the Great Famine.In 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company built a route from Cork City to Douglas. This operated until 1932 when it was replaced by a bus service.\n\n\n=== Later developments (20th-21st century) ===\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Douglas underwent major changes as it became a suburb of Cork. New housing was built and the area between Douglas and Cork City became built-up. Schools, shopping centres and other amenities developed to serve this new population. Douglas Community School was built in 1968, and the original Douglas Shopping Centre was completed in 1972. This shopping centre underwent a significant redevelopment at the turn of the 21st century (although, as of 2020, is closed following a fire). A second shopping centre, Douglas Court Shopping Centre, was built in the late 1980s and a 5-screen multiplex cinema (since demolished) was also built. Several hotels, including the Rochestown Park Hotel and Maryborough House Hotel were also developed. Douglas has two golf facilities, Douglas Golf Club at Maryborough Hill and a driving range at Frankfield Golf Club.Following the release of the MacKinnon Report in 2017, covering a possible extension of Cork city's boundary, it was proposed that the Douglas area (including Douglas, Frankfield, Grange and Donnybrook) would be moved to the administrative area of Cork City Council. This, if implemented, would move all of Douglas to the city, ending the divide of the town between the city and county. The boundary change (incorporating parts of Ballincollig, Douglas, Glanmire, and Rochestown within the city boundary) occurred in late May 2019.\n\n\n== Residential areas ==\n\nFrom the late 19th and into the 20th century, there was an expansion of residential areas in the Douglas catchment. Housing developments (mostly private, with some social housing) were built in Grange, Frankfield, Donnybrook, Maryborough, Rochestown, Mount Oval and along the two main roads connecting Douglas to the city centre, the Douglas Road and the South Douglas Road.Donnybrook, for example, is South of Douglas village, and has a Centra outlet, snooker club, football club (College Corinthians) and forested walkway (at Ballybrack Woods) serve as amenities for the residential developments in the Donnybrook Hill area.Grange and Frankfield (encompassed by Frankfield/Grange parish) lie to the West of Douglas village, and are mainly residential areas served by retail outlets (including SuperValu and Aldi), schools (like Scoil Nioclais primary school) and other services (including an office of Douglas credit union). The residential development at Mount Oval has a bar, Spar, and a pharmacy.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\n\nAmenities and green-spaces in the area include Douglas Community Park (a 5-acre park close to the centre of Douglas which includes a playground), and Ballybrack Woods (a wooded area south of Douglas village which is known locally as 'Mangala').There have been calls to build a pedestrian and cycle trail through the woods around Vernon Mount, carried by an overbridge across the South Ring Road to Tramore Valley Park.\n\n\n== Shopping and business ==\nThe village centre of Douglas has two principal commercial streets, East Douglas Street and West Douglas Street, which are situated approximately 300m apart. Retail activity is also centred around two shopping centres, Douglas Court Shopping Centre and Douglas Village Shopping Centre. \"Douglas Court\" (anchored by Dunnes Stores) was built in the early-1990s, and \"Douglas Village\" (anchored by Tesco, Marks and Spencer and TK Maxx) was originally developed in the mid-1970s and was the second shopping centre ever built in Ireland.Douglas was formerly the site of the headquarters of Cork and Limerick Savings Bank. However, this bank was merged into Trustee Savings Bank in 1992. The former headquarters was initially still used for regional administration, but this function was transferred to a new building in Cork Airport Business Park.A farmers market is held every Saturday morning outside the Douglas Village Shopping Centre entrance.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 2011 census, the percentage of Irish nationals living in Douglas was 88.8%. UK nationals accounted for 1.7%; Polish nationals 3.2%; Lithuanians 0.6%; Other EU nationals 2.1%; Other nationals 2.9%; 0.7% did not state their nationality.In the 2016 census, 78.6% of residents of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, 8% were members of other religions, 12% had no religion and less than 1% did not state a religion. In the same census, 86.2% of electoral division residents identified as white Irish, 8.3% were other whites, 1% were black, 1.7% Asian or Asian Irish, 1.4% were of other ethnicities, and 1% did not state an ethnicity.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== GAA ===\n\nGAA clubs in the area include the Douglas GAA and Nemo Rangers hurling and football clubs. Nemo Rangers were historically associated with Turners Cross, but moved to a new location in the Trabeg area of Douglas in the 1990s.\nIn the 2004, 2007 and 2012 u10 Community Games, Douglas won the Cork Community Games, the Munster Community Games and the all-Ireland Community Games.\n\n\n=== Association football ===\nLocal association football (soccer) clubs include Tramore Athletic F.C., Grangevale AFC, College Corinthians and Douglas Hall AFC.\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nThere are also local golf (and pitch and putt) clubs, including Douglas Golf Club, Frankfield Golf Club and Douglas Pitch and Putt Club.\n\n\n=== Rugby union ===\nDouglas has representation in rugby union, and Douglas RFC was founded in 1902 as one of the earliest Cork rugby clubs. While this original club drew members from the workforce of St Patrick's Woollen Mills in Douglas (which closed in the 1970s), the club in its current form was founded in 1979.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nOther sports clubs include tennis (Douglas Tennis Club), basketball (Fr. Mathews Basketball Club), gymnastics (Douglas Gymnastics Club), martial arts (at Elite Fitness Centre), cricket and hockey clubs (Cork Harlequins and Church of Ireland Hockey Club).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe N40 passes through Douglas, but it is not possible to turn onto it in an eastbound direction and westbound traffic may not leave the road. Fuller access is available via the N28 from nearby Rochestown.\nDouglas is served by a number of R-standard roads, including the R609 (which links to the N28 at Maryborough), R610 (Passage West to Cork city centre), R851 (Cork city centre to the N27), and R853 (to Ballinlough).\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nBus services are provided by Bus \u00c9ireann, and the routes which pass through Douglas include numbers 206 (Grange to the city centre), 207 (Donnybrook to Ballyvolane), 216 (Mount Oval to Cork University Hospital), 219 (Mahon to Cork Institute of Technology), 220 (Ovens - Grange Manor to Carrigaline and Crosshaven), and 223 (Cork City Centre to Haulbowline).\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe nearest active railway station is Cork Kent railway station, approximately 5 km away. Until 1932, Douglas was served by the Blackpool-Douglas route of the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company.\n\n\n== Religious congregations ==\n\nAs of the 2016 census, 78.6% of the population of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, with St. Columbas as the first Catholic parish church in the area, dating to 1814. From the 1960s, with housing developments and population growth in Douglas, overcrowding in St. Columbas prompted a decision to build a new Catholic church in the Grange/Frankfield area. This new church (the Church of the Incarnation) was consecrated in 1976, and was a chapel-of-ease to the Douglas parish before being separating into its own parish in 1982. St. Patrick's Catholic church serves the Rochestown area, and dates to 1991.Other religious congregations serving the Douglas population include St. Lukes (Anglican) church which was consecrated in 1875, the Wesley Chapel (Methodist) church on the Douglas Road, Douglas Baptist congregation (which meets at Douglas Community School), Radical Life (Pentecostal) church, the Holy Trinity (Anglican) church in Frankfield which dates to 1838, and the Inspiration House (RCCG) in Frankfield.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJohn Dunlay, recipient of the Victoria Cross\nJack Gleeson, film and stage actor\nGerald Goldberg, first Jewish Lord Mayor of Cork\nRob Heffernan, Irish Olympian\nCillian Murphy, film and stage actor\nBilly O'Callaghan, Irish short story writer\nDonncha O'Callaghan, professional Rugby union player\nRonan O'Gara, professional rugby player\nLennox Robinson, dramatist, poet and director of the Abbey Theatre\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nPrimary Education:\n\nEglantine \u2013 Catholic girls school\nScoil An Athar Tadhg \u00d3 Murch\u00fa \u2013 Irish language mixed-sex school\nSt. Luke's \u2013 Church of Ireland mixed-sex school\nScoil Nioclais \u2013 Catholic mixed-sex school\nSt. Columba's BNS \u2013 Catholic boys school\nSt. Columba's GNS \u2013 Catholic girls school\nRochestown Educate Together National School (Educate Together mixed-sex school)Secondary:\n\nDouglas Community School \u2013 boys school\nRegina Mundi College \u2013 girls school\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nMetropolitan Cork\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

          "The best distillery/brewery tour in Ireland.  The Guinness Storehouse was pretty cool, but it was way too crowded.  The Jameson's Distillery tour in Middleton was very informative.  If you can, volunteer for the taste test comparison \u2026",
          "Loved it!  The tour was very educational and intuitive.  The grounds were very well kept and clean.  And the Whiskey tasting experience was awesome, sat with a good group of people and the server was entertaining.",
          "Very good and worth treating yourself to a dram or 5",
          "Great location and awesome tour! Must-see if you are around.",
          "Jameson Experiece is the best attraction in the midleton area. While explaination, i had observed some nice decoration and simulation of distillation of the products. One big copper like a kettle design was impressed in this tour. Speak no more, go and experience it. Worth more than the price.",
          "Def worth doing and would puck this every time.  Learned so much and the tour was guide was fun",
          "Tommy was a very knowledgeable tour guide. Great experience and tasting I would definitely recommend the experience.",
          "Even better than Bow Street experience in Dublin!",
          "Really great experience. Was worried the groups would be too big but going offseason during the week is great as with small groups it really feels more personal. The gift shop too, considering its on the tourist trail, is relatively cheap so you can pick up a good quality souvenir.",
          "Visited here today and what a lovely afternoon we had . Such an interesting place and our tour guide Rebecca was a fountain of knowledge and such a lovely girl !!",
          "Visit when I have overseas visitors in town so know what to expect in this fascinating and historic site. The guide today however was irritating in delivery style and her corny \u2018oirish jokes\u2019 reinforced the notion of hard drinking Irish \u2026",
          "You will tour the old distillery adjecent to the new facility. Beautiful old stone buildings and a good tour.",
          "Great experience! The staff was extremely helpful and polite. We even picked up a bottle of the Midleton Very Rare and a personalized bottle of the Jameson Distillers Reserve.",
          "Very interesting tour. The guides even try to make jokes and get people to participate. They really know their stuff. You get to taste some whiskey at the end of the tour in the bar where you can stay a little while if you like. The only downfall is the gift shop is so expensive.  Otherwise we loved it. Great experience over all.",
          "The Campus Tour was amazing, a lot of great information and the tour guide was funny, plus free drinks (tasting) at the end. Nomnom",
          "Chemistry & taste... for your off time",
          "Really interesting experience and the best Whiskey after! Worth a visit for any Whiskey lover.",
          "Had a wonderful behind the scenes tour with Peter. I learned so much about Jameson\u2019s process and history not to mention the fabulous tasting experience. I\u2019ve adopted a new appreciation for fine Irish whiskey now! This is a must see Irish \u2026",
          "Excellent attraction, not just for tourist but for locals as well",
          "Really enjoyed the tour and experiencing the history of this famous tipple. Comparing against other whisky\u2019s was good also. Glad I wasn\u2019t the designated driver that day!!!",
          "The staff provides an excellent tour of the historic distillery. The modern distillery is on an adjacent property. The historic site is very well maintained and the tour is very informative. The gift shop and pub bar is well designed and will provide you with everything Jameson.",
          "This was such a fantastic tour! Not one time did I feel overwhelmed with other tourists walking around aimlessly.  The staff here does such a great job keeping each group on it's own tour! It was very easy to get pictures and we even had time to ask questions.",
          "Great place to learn about the history of Irish whiskey.",
          "The staff were knowledge and friendly, and the tour was not only informative, but fun! Aiofe knew what she was doing and made the experience really worth it. Great work! The tour itself is really interesting and gives a good insight into \u2026",
          "Great tour about one hour and you get free samples at the end of the tour",
          "Fantastic day out and Peter was a fantastic tour guide with an obvious love for the history of the distillery which is brilliant to see",
          "Amazing experience for any whiskey lover. The experience tour itself takes you through the incredible history of the brand as well as the various distillation processes. It really is an experience. The premium whiskey tasting is amazing, \u2026",
          "When we first arrived we didn't think this tour would be that great (we compared it to the Guinness tour in Dublin). It was a small waiting room, a restaurant that was packed and closing soon, and a little shop. But then we took the tour. \u2026",
          "I took a coach party there and they loved it. Great tour, nice cafe onsite. Cork being my ancestral home, it was a good trip.",
          "Totally awesome.  Great history and tastings!",
          "Went with friends and family, enjoy the experience. Went for the premium wiskey tasting and it's well worth it.",
          "Must stop by here. Great tour great samples.",
          "I'm a local and this is the first place I bring visitors. Very well run, interesting and professional. The tastings available here are top notch.",
          "Jamison has always been my favorite whisky. The tour and tasting was great! I also got to fill and label my own bottle straight from the cask. ",
          "Been here twice and was picked as an official irish Whisky taster. Love this place. \ud83e\udd43\ud83c\udf40",

          "Great tourist attraction, good guidance, some whiskey tasting overal good \ud83d\ude01",
          "Did the tasting only and was not disappointed. The building and property are impressive and the gift shop has many unique items you cannot find other places. Good location close to town with other shops and restaurants.",
          "Pretty staged but good visit. Different than the smaller distilleries as you get to see production lines on those but not here.",
          "Have been on several distillery tour's throughout Ireland. Always thought that home brewed bushmills was hard to beat. Today surpassed it. Thougherly enjoyed the Distiller's Apprentice tour. Our guide (Peter) was first class, very knowledgeable and great crack. Will be adding to my whiskey selection. \nMany thanks.",
          "Really enjoyed this experience. Nice to get a taster during the tour. Did the tour with the kids... even though they couldn't partake the guide made sure they were very involved. Good value!",
          "Great tour full of history, also very educational. Free Jameson neat or cocktail at the end. Definitely worth the visit.",
          "The distillery itself is interesting, but the shop is excellent. Focus on the bottles you can only get there, as the prices aren't different from high street stores, and higher than duty free at Dublin if you can get them. If your wallet is ready for it, go for the Midleton Very Rare and you can sign the registry!",
          "What an amazing afternoon. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Well worth the visit.",
          "What a fantastic experience.  Learnt lots and enjoyed seeing the factory.  Only a young guide but she really knew her stuff. And very confident in her role. Well done to Keyleigh  (I think)",
          "2nd time to do the tour and it's just as good as the first. Great experience. Mush do on anyone's list",
          "Good tour. You get to compare Jameson to other non-Jameson brands in the tasting, which really sets it apart from other tours. They want you to know the difference and why, in their opinion, Jameson stands above the rest.",
          "A must when you visit Midleton. I think a bit pricey for some of the tours but enjoyed it very much. Our guide was friendly and informative and I really enjoyed the whole exhibition and the whiskey tasting at the end.",
          "A truly great and wonderful experience. As far as I know there are tours every 30 minutes or so that leave on the minute. You start off watching a short movie about the history of Jameson. Then you go through the entire distillery and they \u2026",
          "Very intersting visit but our guide seemed to be in a hurry, he skipped some parts and did not stop for questions. But why 4 stars then ? Because there's MIKE. Mike is the best salesman I've ever seen, he was patient, and knew exactly what \u2026",
          "Great visitor attraction.  Learned a great deal here about Irish whiskey and the Jameson brand.  Friendly staff and our tour guide was very interactive and knowledgeable.  Would recommend this to anyone who is staying in the area, including Cork City.  10 minute walk from Midleton station, but enjoyable to see the town en route.",
          "Really loved the tour. Even though I am not a whiskey fan but very informative.",
          "Nice place, worth seeing",
          "By far the best tour we took. Informative and entertaining staff. Very well maintained and interactive.",
          "If you enjoy learning about what you drink ( and I do) it was a very informative tour and the tasting afterwards was very nice",
          "Great visit very informative with lots of whiskey testing at the end and a free glass. I dont like whiskey but it would still a great experience",
          "Visited this distillery while in Midleton during the bad snowy weather and have to say that the staff could not have done more to accommodate us. The tour guide was very informative and his knowledge of the distillery was brilliant. I will definitely return again.",
          "Went as part of a stag group and the trip was made by the tour guide Louis (Louie?). It was only his second week on the job but he was well able for a rowdy group of semi drunk Dublin lads. He was able to answer any question and more \u2026",
          "Too many people in a tour together. It's not a real factory tour but a location made for tourist only.",
          "We did the basic hour and a half tour, and it was absolutely wonderful. Learned the overall background of the distillery, had some tastings and a tasty drink at the end. Definitely worth the 20\u20ac",
          "Very nice shop and caf\u00e9. Free coffee refills when I was there.",
          "We loved the tour! The buildings and history are amazing. Our tour guide, Peter, was great. The food at the restaurant was incredible. I can't recommend it enough!",
          "This is a great tour, even if you've done the tour in Dublin. There are many more buildings to see, and it is much more interactive. The bar is bigger and it seems like they have more options for personalized bottles. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood.",
          "Very interesting visits, wonderful guides, and always nice to get to taste !",
          "Very well thought out tour that is overall very interesting, fun and full of history. They've managed to retain all the buildings from the old distillery, while the new buildings still function on the property at the back, which allows for \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience.... really authentic all the way through.... friendly staff, lots of knowledge given during the tour, Jameson drink at the end and a gr8 gift shop... overall a wonderful experience 5 *",

          "Had a great tour and tasting, thanks to Mike our great tour guide and the Jameson bar team.",
          "Best tour of our entire trip. Tour guide was extremely informative and had a great sense of humor. The free glass at the end was a nice bonus!",
          "Great tour and tasting! Personable guides and just the right amount of detail. Thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "When in Ireland try some Irish whiskey! The tour was good and you can pour and purchase your own bottle of whiskey not sold in stores. The restaurant had good food and really nice people working.",
          "Brilliant guide in Brian took his time and explained everything really enjoyed the tour",
          "Excellent tour. Really enjoyed it.. There's a fabulous shop too with great quality and excellent value",
          "We have been to many places but this had to be the very best experience so far. It's extremely interesting and our guide Michael was fantastic. For whiskey lover's you'll enjoy the history of it the making of it and more importantly the tasting of each variety. We went on the 2 hour experience tour and would highly recommend it. ",
          "Excellent I can say any more",
          "Great experience for understanding Irish whiskey. Several tour options available, check online for start times/tickets so you don't show 5 minutes after the tour starts. Ticket counter very helpful. Guide friendly and informative. Tasting \u2026",
          "Really nice shop and atmosphere :)",
          "Jameson experience is well worth a visit, from locals and tourists alike. I find the staff very helpful there, always accommodating for bringing guests, or finding a special gift for whiskey lovers.",
          "Very good tour explaining whiskey distillation process and maturation in oak barrels.",
          "My trip was planned a few weeks ahead for Academy experience. When we arrived sadly there was an issue in their system and we could not go on that tour. The staff was very accommodating and offered store credit for lower but still amazing \u2026",
          "Awesome facility, tour, friendly staff, and Whiskey!",
          "This is great experience. We've learnt a about Jameson heritage of whiskey distillation. However there was absolutely no time for taking photos during the tour.",
          "Highlight of our trip, really.  Learned so much about the different whiskeys, the laws, the process etc.  Didn't mind a bit tasting Irish, Scotch and bourbon so that I would learn the difference.  After they get you dauced, you're deposited \u2026",
          "Excellent tour and tasting.  Informative tour guide gave lots of info/history.  In addition to the tour we chose the premium whiskey tasting.  It was worth it.",
          "Highly recommmend. Very cool tour and not too long. They give you very good history about their whiskey and also just whiskey in general. Followed up by an included tasting and drink and then a visit to their gift shop.",
          "A very good tour, just over an hour for the basic tour.  Educational but not too detailed, even my 5 year old enjoyed it.  Got to test the difference between American, Scottish and Irish Whiskey and a lovely cocktail at the end.",
          "Very enjoyable, did the standard tour with the premium tasting. I highly recommend the experience to any Whiskey drinkers however the tour includes some incorrect generalisations. That being said I fully intend to take the Distillers apprentice tour the next time I am in the area.",
          "Lovely spot, great tours. Leave the car at home if you are going sampling whiskey.",
          "The best toured alcohol facility I have ever experienced. Volunteer near the end its awesome. Also highly recommend the private tasting after, got to have a bit of some of the finest whiskey Jameson has to offer. Even got a taste of a \u20ac260 \u2026",
          "2nd time i've been. Its just amazing. Even though the \"standard\" tour is way too fast, bring more time with you and pick the \"behind the scenes\" or \"apprentice\" tour.",
          "Gotta love Jameson. . Currently this location is the only place in the world to buy Jameson 12 yr old distillery reserve.",
          "Was plenty touristy, lots of great tasting options.  We did the basic tour and the purchased tasting.  They complemented each other very well and were well worth the price.  We showed up the day of (without reservations) and had no problem \u2026",
          "Well worth the visit!",
          "Interesting tour around the old distillery with whiskey tasting at the end.The gift shop was good too with some whiskeys you can only buy at the distillery. Well worth the trip. If traveling from Cork there's a bus from St Patrick's Quay, making it easy to get to. I would recommend it!",
          "We had an absolutely wonderful (6th) time at the distillery today.\n\nThank you to Dean and Adam for being great hosts and making our day!",

          "Great tour with extremely knowledgeable guides and amazing tasting sessions. Deep pockets are needed for some of the gifts but well worth it. You will spend 2+ hours here",

          "Fantastic behind the scenes tour. Loads of fun and whisky too. Our tour guide Tommy was very cool too. We'll be back!",
          "Interesting tour. Tells the history of the Whisky and you walk inside the old factory. For me, the most interesting part was the new mini brewery.",
          "Tour was great, very in depth and the staff were friendly and knowledgable. Unfortunately the Jameson bus we had booked left without us both too and from the distillery without our knowledge as the bus driver was pulling off minutes before \u2026",
          "Fun and good tour to see the history of the Jameson brand. The tour goes into the history of when Jameson started and to where it is now. Great scene's at the experience and it is definitely a sight to see if you like Jameson or spirit based alcohol. Check this place out!",

          "Fantastic tour. Guides really know the story behind Irish Whiskey",
          "Tour of historic buildings of the old distillery (not a working distillery) is nice. The shop, store, and bar are lovely. \n\nI missed the smell of fermentation and filling. There is a working micro distillery on the grounds, and we saw that.",

          "Amazing. Get ready to sample and buy some of the best Irish Whiskey.",

          "Very nice tour about the distillery in Midleton and its history, takes about 75mins. If youre in for the small Whiskey tasting Server, you better go to the distillery in Bow Street, Dublin, where everyone gets to the tasting. Otherwise very informative and well displayed, tour guides are helpful and friendly.",

          "While the tour feels a little rushed, it's great. If you're a fan of craft beer, you'll see some similarities between distilling whiskey and brewing beer. Saoirse, our tour guide was great and very open to questions. It's clear why the Irish are so proud of their whiskey as their history is so rich. ",
          "If you are interested in whiskey making technology it's for you...also you can buy whiskey here with your name on the label",
          "Lovely place. Really interesting tour with an excellent guide. Restored sympatbetically, the buildings are still very real; not prettied up too much like at many attractions. Although interesting all through the tour was a wee bit long. We learned a lot and a great time was had by all.",

          "Just a word: incredibile!",
          "They do not show the working distillery here but only a museum. Tickets are rather expensive. At the end there were not enough places for all members of the group to take part in the whisky tasting - that was really disgusting.",
          "Definitely worth springing for the premium tasting.  Great look at the whole process as it has developed o er the centuries.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Cobh ( KOHV, Irish: An C\u00f3bh), known from 1849 until 1920 as Queenstown, is a tourist seaport town on the south coast of County Cork, Ireland. Cobh is on the south side of Great Island in Cork Harbour and home to one of Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminals. Tourism in the area draws on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town. It was associated with the RMS Titanic, which was built in Belfast.\nFacing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. On a high point in the town stands the cathedral church of the diocese of Cloyne, St Colman's, which is one of the tallest buildings in Ireland.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe port, which has had several Irish language names, was first called \"Cove\" (\"The Cove of Cork\") in 1750. It was renamed by the British as \"Queenstown\" in 1849 to commemorate a visit by Queen Victoria. The name was changed to Cobh, during the Irish War of Independence, following the passing of a motion by the local administrative council on 2 July 1920. Cobh is a Gaelicisation of the English name Cove, and it shares the same pronunciation. It has no meaning in the Irish language.\nIn ancient times the area was known as Cuan an Neimheadh (the Harbour of Neimheidh), while Great Island was called Oile\u00e1n Ard Neimheidh (the high or important island of Neimheidh).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAccording to legend, one of the first colonists of Ireland was Neimheidh, who landed in Cork Harbour over 1,000 years BC. He and his followers were said to have been wiped out in a plague, but the Great Island was known in Irish as Oilean Ard Neimheadh because of its association with him.  Later it became known as Crich Liathain because of the powerful U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in kingdom, who ruled in the area from Late Antiquity into the early 13th century. The island subsequently became known as Oilean Mor An Barra (the Great Island of Barry & Barrymore), after the Barry family who inherited it.\n\nThe village on the island was known in English as Ballyvoloon, overlooking \"The Cove\". In 1743 the British built a fort, later to become known as Cove Fort, to the east of the village. The settlement was first referred to as Cove village in 1750 by Smith the historian who said: \"it was inhabited by seamen and revenue officials\". The Cork directory of 1787 shows about thirty businesses in the town, including one butcher and one draper. \nThe Water Club established at Haulbowline in 1720 was the progenitor of the present Royal Cork Yacht Club (RCYC, now based in Crosshaven) and is the oldest yacht club in the world. The RCYC was based for many years in Cobh and the present Sirius Arts Centre used to be a clubhouse of the RCYC organisation. In 1966, the RCYC merged with the Royal Munster Yacht Club, retaining the name of the RCYC but moving its headquarters to those of the RMYC at Crosshaven at the other side of the harbour.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nInternational upheaval led to Cobh undergoing rapid development in the early 19th century. Due to the natural protection of its harbour setting, the town became important as a tactical centre for naval military base purposes, never more so than at the time of the Napoleonic Wars . Today, the Irish Naval Service headquarters is on Haulbowline Island facing Cobh.\nThe wars against the French led to the town, then usually known as Ballyvoloon or The Cove of Cork, being developed as a British naval port assigned an admiral. Many of the present-day buildings date from this time of build up. George Brodrick, 5th Viscount Midleton engaged the English architect Decimus Burton to improve the streetscape and buildings during the 1840s. The eventual cessation of hostilities dented Cobh's prosperity for a while, but it soon became known as a health resort; many patients stayed here for their health because of the temperate climate. Amongst their number was Charles Wolfe, who wrote \"The Burial of Sir John Moore After Corunna\". Wolfe's body is buried in the Old Church Cemetery outside the town.\n\n\n=== RMS Titanic ===\n\nOne of the major transatlantic Irish ports, the town was the departure point for 2.5 million of the six million Irish people who emigrated to North America between 1848 and 1950. On 11 April 1912, as Queenstown, it was the final port of call for the RMS Titanic before she set out across the Atlantic on the last leg of her maiden voyage. She was assisted by the P.S. America and the P.S. Ireland, two ageing White Star Line tenders, along with several other smaller boats delivering first-class passengers' luggage. Some sources and local lore suggest that a Titanic crew member, John Coffey, a native of Queenstown, left the ship at this time, thereby saving his life. 123 passengers boarded at Queenstown, with only 44 surviving the sinking.\n\n\n=== Penal transportation ===\nCobh was earlier a major embarkation port for men, women and children who were deported to penal colonies such as Australia. The records of such deportations can be found in ships' log books in the Cobh Museum. Since 1973 it has been housed in Scots Church (a Presbyterian church until its 1969 closure), which overlooks the harbour where so many departed.\n\n\n=== Shipbuilding ===\nA significant shipbuilding industry was developed in the town. The remnants of the Verolme Shipyard today maintain many of the original cranes and hoists now forming part of an industrial and maritime heritage. \n\nThe age of steam brought Cobh association with several milestones, including the first steam ship to sail from Ireland to England (1821) and the first steam ship to cross the Atlantic (Sirius 1838), which sailed from Passage West. \nIn 1849, the name of the town was changed to Queenstown, to honour Queen Victoria who had visited Ireland during that year.\n\n\n=== RMS Lusitania and the First World War ===\nAnother ship to be associated with the town, the Cunard passenger liner RMS Lusitania, was sunk by a German U-boat off the Old Head of Kinsale while en route from the US to Liverpool on 7 May 1915. 1,198 passengers died, while 700 were rescued. The survivors and the dead alike were brought to Queenstown, and the bodies of over 100 who perished in the disaster lie buried in the Old Church Cemetery just north of the town. The Lusitania Peace Memorial is located in Casement Square, opposite the arched building housing the Cobh Library and Courthouse.\n\nDuring the First World War, Queenstown was a naval base for British and American destroyers operating against the U-boats that preyed upon Allied merchant shipping.  Q-ships (heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks) were called Q-ships precisely because many were, in fact, fitted-out in Queenstown.  The first division of American destroyers arrived in May 1917, and the sailors who served on those vessels were the first American servicemen to see combat duty in the war.  When that first convoy arrived in port after enduring a rough passage in what were little more than open boats, its members were met by a crowd of sailors and townspeople, thankful for their anticipated help towards stopping the U-boats that were blockading western Europe.  Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, commander of the Coast of Ireland station, met the senior American officer, Commander Joseph Taussig, at the dock and inquired as to how soon the weatherbeaten American ships could be put to use. \"We're ready now, sir!\" was the widely quoted answer from the American.\nThe United States Navy established U.S. Naval Air Station Queenstown in February 1918. It operated flying boats during the last months of WW1, and closed in April 1919.Due to its tactical military importance, under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, the port remained a UK sovereign base within the Irish Free State after 1922. Along with the other Treaty Ports, it was handed over to the government of the Irish Free State in 1938.\n\n\n== Economy and tourism ==\n\nTourism is a large employer in Cobh. Large cruise liners visit Cobh each year, mainly during the summer months, although many of the tourists are transported out of Cobh by bus to other tourist destinations. In all, almost 100,000 cruise liner passengers and crew arrive in the town each year when their ships berth right in the centre of the town at the Republic of Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminal. Tourist attractions are focused on the maritime and emigration legacy of the town and include the Queenstown Story at the Cobh Heritage Centre, Titanic Experience, Titanic Trail walking tour, Cobh Museum, Cobh Road Train, Spike Island tours and St Colman's Cathedral. The town has remained largely unchanged since RMS Titanic departed from Cork Harbour in 1912, with the streetscape and piers still much the same. Facing the town are Spike Island and Haulbowline Island. The latter is the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service, formerly a British naval base.\nCobh was home to Ireland's only steelworks, the former state-owned Irish Steel works which was closed by its buyer, Ispat International, in 2001. There is a controversy over the slag heap on the steelworks, where there are concerns that it may be leaching into the harbour. Another important employer in Cobh was the Dutch-owned Verolme Cork Dockyard, in Rushbrooke. It opened in 1960 but ceased operations in the mid-1980s. In 1981 the MV Leinster was built at Verolme for service on the Dublin \u2013 Holyhead route. The last ship built at Verolme was the Irish Naval Service's L\u00c9 Eithne (P31). Ship repair work is still carried at Rushbrooke using the drydock and slip way carriages. The drydock pumps date from 1912.In the 21st century, a number of new developments were completed, such as a new retail park at Ticknock in 2008, and a leisure centre (with 25m swimming pool) in August 2007. In 2010, tours of Spike Island commenced, with tours leaving from Kennedy Pier, near the town centre.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nOutside of the Dublin metropolitan area, Cobh is one of the few towns in Ireland served by a commuter train service. The town is one of two termini for Cork Commuter Services. The other is Midleton.  Regular commuter services run between Cork city and Cobh, calling at, among others, Fota railway station, Carrigaloe railway station, and Rushbrooke railway station, along the way. Trains run every day and the journey time to Cork is under 25 minutes.\nCobh railway station opened on 10 March 1862 and was closed for goods traffic on 3 November 1975.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe nearest airport is Cork Airport, which can be reached in 20\u201330 minutes from Cobh via the R624 road and the N25 road.\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port Operations Centre for Cork Harbour is located in the town. The port's harbour pilot launches are based at the Camber - a pier and dock are at the eastern end of the town.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nCurrently there is only a single road and road bridge that leads onto the Great Island. This road bridge, Belvelly Bridge, was built in 1803 at one of the narrowest points in the channels around Great Island.\n\n\n=== Cross River Ferry ===\nIn 1993 a Cross River Ferry was established which allowed cars and passengers to travel from Glenbrook near Monkstown to Carrigaloe on the Great Island.  The crossing from Glenbrook to Carrigaloe takes four minutes and runs daily. Reservations are not required.\n\n\n== Local government and politics ==\nWhile local administration was overseen by Cobh Town Council for some years, this local government body was abolished in 2014. Since then, the town has fallen within the area of responsibility of Cork County Council. Cobh Municipal District, one of eight municipal districts overseen by the council, is represented by six elected councillors. As of 2019, these include 1 Labour Party, 2 Fine Gael, 1 Fianna F\u00e1il, 1 Green Party and 1 independent councillor. The town is also part of the D\u00e1il constituency of Cork East.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n\nThe Sirius Arts Centre is a hub for the arts in Cobh and is located on the waterfront. It hosts cultural events and music concerts both in-house and around Cobh.The Cobh Peoples Regatta is held every year around August, and includes on-stage performances from local musicians and performers as well as a pageant to decide the 'Regatta Queen'. The festival typically ends with a fireworks display over the harbour.Cobh was the setting for the 2009 Connor McPherson film The Eclipse, and also used as a filming location for the 1999 movie Angela's Ashes.\n\n\n== Education ==\nCobh has several primary and secondary schools including Colaiste Muire secondary school and Cobh Community College. Scoil Iosaef Naofa is a boys primary school in the town, and has reached the Sciath na Scoil finals (in hurling and gaelic football) on several occasions.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nCobh GAA is the local GAA club, and has a centre for gaelic games at Carrignafoy.Cobh Pirates RFC are the town's rugby union club, and compete at underage and other levels. The club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2015. They play their home games at 'The Paddocks' in Newtown, where facilities include a gym, two playing pitches, a training pitch and a rubber training surface. The Cobh Pirates Ladies team was formed circa 2010.The most noted association football (soccer) team in the area is Cobh Ramblers, where Roy Keane started-out before transferring to English side Nottingham Forest, and Stephen Ireland started his career with the club's underage, Springfield Ramblers. Cobh Ramblers play in the League of Ireland First Division, with home games at St Colman's Park. Another local football team, Springfield AFC, based at Pat O'Brien Park, Ballyleary, has both junior and senior football teams.Cobh Golf Club has an 18-hole championship course at Marino on the main R624 road into the town. Cobh is also home to one of the oldest existing tennis clubs in Ireland, Rushbrooke Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, founded in 1870.There are two coastal rowing clubs in the area, Cobh Fishermen and Rushbrooke Rowing Club, with the latter established in 1989. Other events on the water include the \"Escape from Spike Island\" triathlon, which was first held in 2012 and organised by Cobh Triathlon Club. It takes place annually in late summer, with both Olympic distance and sprint distance courses. The first \"Great Island 10\" (a 10-mile road race) took place on 18 April 2010, to raise funds for the Irish Cancer Society.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAnne Elizabeth Ball (1808\u20131872) and Mary Ball (1812\u20131898), sisters and scientists in the history of phycology\nRobert Ball (1802\u20131857) brother of Anne and Mary Ball, zoologist\nDecimus Burton (1800\u20131881), English architect and designer of much of Cobh's streetscape\nNellie Cashman (1845\u20131925), gold prospector and philanthropist who was born near Cobh or at Midleton\nPatsy Donovan (1865\u20131953), major league baseball player in the US\nCharles Guilfoyle Doran (1835\u20131909), Fenian and clerk of works for the building of Cobh Cathedral, lived in the town most of his life\nJack Doyle (1913\u20131978), boxer, actor and singer\nFrederick Edwards (1894\u20131964), recipient of the Victoria Cross\nJoe English (sailor), Round the world sailor and international yachtsman.\nRobert Forde (1875\u20131959), Antarctic explorer\nMaeve Higgins, comedian\nStephen Ireland,  Stoke City footballer\nRoy Keane, former Manchester United footballer, started his professional career with Cobh Ramblers\nSean McLoughlin, Hull City footballer\nElizabeth Louisa Moresby (1862\u20131931), fantasy writer\nJohn O'Flynn, footballer\nFergus O'Rourke (1923\u20132010), zoologist resident in Cobh while Professor at University College Cork\nThomas H.

          "This was a great exhibit if you have any interest in the history of the Titanic. This was the last stop made before it began the Atlantic crossing. It is also of interest if you would like to know about the migration of the Irish to America and Australia.",
          "This illustrated tour gives a great deal of history on the migration - forced or otherwise - of generations of Irish people and also provides a wealth of knowledge on the Titanic and Lusitania ships as well. Additionally there is good information on the potato famines as well.",

          "Neither my wife or I are history buffs, but we both really enjoyed our visit to the Heritage Centre. Lots of information on Irish people leaving their homeland, as well as history about the Titanic and other grand ships of the same era.",
          "We consulted Mr Christy Keating, the Cobh genealogist on 3 May 2019. I was looking for the location of my great-grandparents home in the vicinity of Millstream, Co Cork. Christy pulled up the Grifiths Valuation 1852 map of Denis Connell and superimposed it with Google Earth.",
          "The locals have really tried to make this an enjoyable place to visit and I agree with them. The interior is spacious and clean. Toilets are on your right after you enter the building. There a few shops and there is the display area at the far end. There is an entrance fee",
          "The Heritage Centre focusses on the 3 events that form the basis of Cobh's claim to fame: 1) Emigration, 2) the Titanic (its last port of call), and 3) the sinking of the Lusitania in 1917 just offshore. The price is 10 Euros per adult. There are old photos, diaramas, video",
          "We chose to visit the Cobh Heritage Centre instead of The Titanic Museum. It had a ton of info on Irish Heritage, The Titanic and Lusitania, Irish Famine and more. I absolutely recommend this Centre.",

          "This is a very educational museum on Irish migration throughout history and how Cobh has survived as a major port of emigration. Within the center, there are also exhibitions on the Titanic and the Lusitania. All are self-guided. Costs 10\u20ac and takes about 1-1.5 hrs.",
          "We enjoyed the city of Cobh but the self-directed tour at the Heritage Center was not exactly what we expected. We really were interested in the ancestry records; however, the single computer terminal at the Heritage Center provides access to the same ancestry.com records we",
          "One can get a real sense of Irish history at the Heritage Center. Learned much about the early days of ocean crossing and why people left Ireland and you get an \u2018identity\u2019 to follow and see how things turned out for you in the end. The Famine is briefly discussed - could\u2019ve been",
          "A very interesting narration of emigration from Cobh over centuries. For adults and children alike. Well worth the entrance fee.",
          "Lots of information and artifacts. Leave about 1 1/2 hrs if you're like me and want to see and read everything. Not 5 stars as a couple of the interactive exhibit s weren't working and had no out of order signage. Someone should check now and then during the day. I was there",

          "The Cobh Heritage Centre is near the pier and we went there on the walk back to the ship. Lots of historic information presented in a very interesting manner, as well as shops and restaurants. If going on your own, this would actually be a good place to start as it would point",

          "Fantastic exhibition detailing Irish history. Wonderfully delivered. We did not have sufficient time to see it all as we were prebooked to visit Spike Island. However,as we did not have sufficient time to complete the tour, we were told we could revisit anytime as long as we",
          "There are trains every hour, on the hour, from cork railway station, taking just 24mins to get to Cobh. (\u20ac10.15 for a day return) The heritage centre is just round the back of the station. Lovely place, that is trying to keep its traditional buildings and surroundings going, but",

          "We were lucky to have a visit to the Cobh Heritage Center while visiting Cobh. The museum is very informative on the history of Ireland and the personal history of Irish people emigrating. It also told the story of Titanic and other large ocean going vessels. A great lesson",
          "Not to be missed if you re spending any time in Cobh. We spent a few hours here and felt moved and educated by the Queenstown Story. Well presented and entertaining delivery.",
          "This is really a small museum about the immigrants from Ireland to some parts of the world during the potato famine. It was interesting to learn more about that era. At the beginning of the tour, we were given an introduction and presentation. And each visitor was given a card",
          "This is an excellent place to visit, excellent cafe provides snacks and cakes there are also some small bespoke shops. There is a museum about the potato famine as well as the Titanic and Luthatania. Not expensive about 25e for family of four. Tickets provide you with a",

          "This museum, in the visitor center, cover Irish Emigration and the Titanic. This was the last port for the Titanic on its last voyage. It was also the port of embarkation for a good number of the Irish Emigrants. The displays are well done and have many interesting facts",
          "If you have been to Titanic Belfast it may be a bit of a let down but is not meant to be on the same level. If in port on a cruise ship this is well worth a hour to wander through and read some of the history of the ships and the port. Plenty of details are provided via lots",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Cobh Heritage Centre. The story in the exhibit was compelling. Definitely worth a visit. Be sure to see the statue outside.",
          "A group of visitors (35) from Newport Rhode Island were well received by Manager Jack Walsh. Jack gave an introductory summary of the emigration story. He is smarter than he looks. Well I guess he has to be even to ties his own shoes. Jack introduced me to Christy Keating,",

          "We did this right after the Titanic Experience and it was sort of too much of a good thing. There wasn't much that was very interesting to us, but it was well done. Nice gift shop.",
          "This was an alternative to an outside tour due to inclement weather. What a great option! It's like a museum that talks about the Titanic, The first emigrant to be processed through Ellis Island, Queenstown Story, the potato blight, etc. It also has a nice place to grab",
          "To be honest I wasn't expecting a lot as we approached the entrance in the old station and the initial area just inside the exhibit made we wonder if it was just going to be a bunch of still-life scenes that really tell you nothing. However, once you get past that it becomes an",
          "We weren't sure about doing this having already done the Belfast Titanic Experience, but we were glad we did. This is a fascinating display full of information and so well laid out. Well worth the visit!",

          "This museum was quite moving. I found myself overcome with emotion several times. If you have Irish roots, you should make an effort to visit, ESPECIALLY if your ancestors emigrated to The USA, Canada or Australia. It\u2019s hard for us to imagine what our loved ones went through.",
          "This is a must see. We learned so much about immigration and travel from this international port. A well done museum. I would suggest coming early to beat the crowds. A lovely gift shop, restaurant and facilities. Fun for all ages. A well-done museum, utilizing many media",

        "wiki": "Cork (; Irish: Corcaigh, pronounced [\u02c8ko\u027ek\u026a\u025f], from corcach, meaning \"marsh\") is the second largest city in Ireland, located in the south-west of Ireland, in the province of Munster. Following an extension to the city's boundary in 2019, its population is c. 210,000.The city centre is an island positioned between two channels of the River Lee which meet downstream at the eastern end of the city centre, where the quays and docks along the river lead outwards towards Lough Mahon and Cork Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world.Originally a monastic settlement, Cork was expanded by Viking invaders around 915. Its charter was granted by Prince John in 1185. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can be found around South and North Main streets. The third largest city by population on the island of Ireland, the city's cognomen of \"the rebel city\" originates in its support for the Yorkist cause in the Wars of the Roses. Corkonians sometimes refer to the city as \"the real capital\", a reference to its opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty in the Irish Civil War.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by Saint Finbarr in the 6th century. Cork became (more) urbanised some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.\n\nThe city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted \"Black Rent\" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork. Together, these baronies are located between the Barony of Barrymore to the east, Muskerry East to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.\n\nThe city's municipal government was dominated by about 12\u201315 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe \u2013 in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.\nThe medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.\nThe title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent mayor by Queen Victoria on her visit to the city.Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly Irish nationalist city, with widespread support for Irish Home Rule and the Irish Parliamentary Party, but from 1910 stood firmly behind William O'Brien's dissident All-for-Ireland Party. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the Cork Free Press. Cork was overtaken by Belfast as Ireland's second largest city in the nineteenth-century.\nIn the War of Independence, the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British Black and Tans, in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\" and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the Irish Civil War, Cork was for a time held by anti-Treaty forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty National Army in an attack from the sea.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Cork, like the vast majority of Ireland, is mild oceanic (Cfb in the Koeppen climate classification) and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant Hardiness zone 9b. Met \u00c9ireann maintains a climatological weather station at Cork Airport, a few kilometres south of the city centre. The airport is at an altitude of 151 metres (495 ft) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the rest of the city. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at UCC and Clover Hill. Due to its position on the coast, Cork city is subject to occasional flooding.Temperatures below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) or above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) are rare. Cork Airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres (48.34 in) of precipitation annually, most of which is rain. The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 \"rainy\" days a year (over 0.2 millimetres (0.0079 in) of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with \"heavy rain\" (over 5 millimetres (0.20 in)). Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no \"recordable sunshine\", mostly during and around winter.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design provide a throughput of new blood, as do the active theatre components of several courses at University College Cork (UCC). Important elements in the cultural life of the city are: Corcadorca Theatre Company, of which Cillian Murphy was a troupe member prior to Hollywood fame; the Institute for Choreography and Dance, a national contemporary dance resource; the Triskel Arts Centre (capacity c.90), which includes the Triskel Christchurch independent cinema; dance venue the Firkin Crane (capacity c.240); the Cork Academy of Dramatic Art (CADA) and Graffiti Theatre Company; and the Cork Jazz Festival, Cork Film Festival and Live at the Marquee events. The Everyman Palace Theatre (capacity c.650) and the Granary Theatre (capacity c.150) both host plays throughout the year.\nCork is home to the RT\u00c9 Vanbrugh Quartet, and popular rock musicians and bands including John Spillane, Rory Gallagher, Five Go Down to the Sea?, Microdisney, The Frank and Walters, Sultans of Ping, Simple Kid, Fred and Mick Flannery. The opera singers Cara O'Sullivan, Mary Hegarty, Brendan Collins, and Sam McElroy are also Cork born.\nRanging in capacity from 50 to 1,000, the main music venues in the city are the Cork Opera House (capacity c.1000), The Everyman, Cyprus Avenue, Dali, Triskel Christchurch, The Roundy, and Coughlan's.\n\nThe city's literary community centres on the Munster Literature Centre and the Triskel Arts Centre. The short story writers Frank O'Connor and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in hailed from Cork, and contemporary writers include Thomas McCarthy, Gerry Murphy, and novelist and poet William Wall.\nAdditions to the arts infrastructure include modern additions to the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery and renovations to the Cork Opera House in the early 21st century. The Lewis Glucksman Gallery opened in the Autumn of 2004 at UCC, was nominated for the Stirling Prize in the United Kingdom, and the building of a new \u20ac60 million School of Music was completed in September 2007.\nCork was the European Capital of Culture for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the Lonely Planet's top 10 \"Best in Travel 2010\". The guide described Cork as being \"at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse\".There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between Manchester and London, Melbourne and Sydney or Barcelona and Madrid. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves as \"The Rebels\"; the county is known as the Rebel County. This view sometimes manifests itself in humorous references to the Real Capital and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating The People's Republic of Cork.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nThe city has many local traditions in food, including crubeens, tripe and drisheen, which were historically served in eating houses like that run by Katty Barry in the mid-20th century. The English Market sells locally produced foods, including fresh fish, meats, fruit and vegetables, eggs and artisan cheeses and breads. During certain city festivals, food stalls are also sometimes erected on city streets such as St. Patrick's Street or Grand Parade.\n\n\n=== Accent ===\nThe Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of Hiberno-English, displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard Hiberno-English, some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad. The Cork accent displays varying degrees of rhoticity, usually indicative of the speaker's local community.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\n\nBroadcasting companies based in Cork include RT\u00c9 Cork, which has a radio, television and production unit on Father Matthew Street in the city centre. Communicorp Media opened a radio studio in 2019 in the city covering content on both Today FM and Newstalk. Virgin Media Television also has an office in the city which covers local news stories developing within the city and county.The city's FM radio band features RT\u00c9 Radio 1, RT\u00c9 2fm, RT\u00c9 lyric fm, RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta, Today FM, Classic Hits, Newstalk and the religious station Spirit Radio. There are also local stations such as Cork's 96FM, Cork's Red FM, C103, CUH 102.0FM, UCC 98.3FM (formerly Cork Campus Radio 97.4fm) and Christian radio station Life 93.1FM. Cork also has a temporary licensed citywide community station 'Cork FM Community Radio' on 100.5FM, which is on-air on Saturdays and Sundays only. Cork has also been home to pirate radio stations, including South Coast Radio and ERI in the 1980s. Today some small pirates stations remain.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nCork is home to one of Ireland's main national newspapers, the Irish Examiner (formerly the Cork Examiner). Its 'sister paper', The Echo (formerly the Evening Echo), was for decades connected to the \"Echo boys\", who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in parts of the city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the Cork Independent. The city's university publishes the UCC Express and Motley magazine.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nCork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods. The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the Red Abbey. There are two cathedrals in the city; St. Mary's Cathedral and Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the Catholic cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Church of Ireland (Anglican) and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect William Burges.\nSt. Patrick's Street, the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. At its northern end is a landmark statue of Father Mathew. The reason for its curved shape is that it was originally a channel of the River Lee which was built over on arches. The General Post Office, with its limestone fa\u00e7ade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal  which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor Pablo Fanque rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.\nThe Grand Parade is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions. The old financial centre is the South Mall, with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century, such as the Allied Irish Bank's which was once an exchange.\n\nMany of the city's buildings are in the Georgian style, although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures, such as County Hall tower, which was, at one time the tallest building in Ireland until being superseded by another Cork City building: The Elysian. Outside the County Hall is the landmark sculpture of two men, known locally as 'Cha and Miah'. Across the river from County Hall is Ireland's longest building; built in Victorian times, Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital has now been partially renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall, after its architect William Atkins.Cork's most famous building is the church tower of Shandon, which dominates the North side of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon. Another site in Shandon is Skiddy's Almshouse, which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to the poorest of the city.\nCork City Hall, another notable building of limestone, replaced the previous one which was destroyed by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence in an event known as the \"Burning of Cork\". The cost of this new building was provided by the UK Government in the 1930s as a gesture of reconciliation.\n\nOther notable places include Elizabeth Fort, the Cork Opera House, Christ Church on South Main Street (now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church), and St Mary's Dominican Church on Popes Quay. Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of University College Cork, through which the River Lee flows, the Women's Gaol at Sunday's Well (now a heritage centre) and the English Market. This covered market traces its origins back to 1610, and the present building dates from 1786.Parks and amenity spaces include Fitzgerald's Park to the west of the city (which contains the Cork Public Museum), the angling lake known as The Lough, Bishop Lucey Park (which is centrally located and contains a portion of the old city wall) and the Marina and Atlantic Pond (an avenue and amenity near Blackrock used by joggers, runners and rowing clubs).Up until April 2009, there were also two large commercial breweries in the city. The Beamish and Crawford on South Main Street closed in April 2009 and transferred production to the Murphy's brewery in Lady's Well. This brewery also produces Heineken for the Irish market. There is also the Franciscan Well brewery, which started as an independent brewery in 1998 but has since been acquired by Coors.\n\n\n== Local government and politics ==\n\nWith a population of approximately 210,000, Cork is the second-most populous city in the State and the 16th-most populous area of local government. Per the Local Government Act 2001, Cork City Council is a tier-1 entity of local government with the same status in law as a county council.\nWhile local government in Ireland has limited powers in comparison with other countries, the council has responsibility for planning, roads, sanitation, libraries, street lighting, parks, and a number of other important functions. Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral areas. As of the 2019 Cork City Council election, the council's members are affiliated to the following political parties: Fianna F\u00e1il (8 members), Fine Gael (7 members), Green Party (4 members), Sinn F\u00e9in (4 members), Labour (1 member), Solidarity\u2013People Before Profit (1 member), Workers' Party (1 member), Independents (5 members). Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the South-West Regional Authority. A new Lord Mayor of Cork is chosen in a vote by the elected members of the council under a D'Hondt system count. Since June 2020, the mayor has been Joe Kavanagh of Fine Gael.Cork City Hall is located along Albert Quay on the south side of the city. It officially opened on 8 September 1936, following the previous building being destroyed in the \"Burning of Cork\" in 1920. The administrative offices for Cork County Council are also located within the city limits, on the Carrigrohane Road on the west side of the city.For the purposes of elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the city is part of two constituencies: Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central which each returns four TDs. Following the 2016 general election, these constituencies together returned two TDs for the Fine Gael party, three for Fianna F\u00e1il, two for Sinn F\u00e9in and one for the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit.\nIn 2018, cabinet approval was given for an extension of the Cork City Council boundary, to include Cork Airport, Douglas, Ballincollig and other surrounding areas. This extension was completed in mid-2019.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nThe retail trade in Cork city includes a mix of modern shopping centres and family owned local shops. Shopping centres can be found in several of Cork's suburbs, including Blackpool, Ballincollig, Douglas, Ballyvolane, Wilton and at Mahon Point Shopping Centre.\n\nOther shopping arcades are in the city centre, including the \"Cornmarket Centre\" on Cornmarket Street, \"Merchant's Quay Shopping Centre\" on Merchant's Quay, home to Debenhams, Dunnes Stores and Marks & Spencer, and a retail street called Opera Lane off St. Patrick's Street/Academy Street. A mixed retail and office development, on the site of the former Capitol Cineplex, with approximately 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) of retail space, was opened in June 2017. Retail tenants in this development include Facebook, AlienVault and Huawei.Cork's main shopping street is St. Patrick's Street and is the most expensive street in the country per sq. metre after Dublin's Grafton Street. The area was impacted by the post-2008 downturn, though retail growth has increased since, with Penneys announcing expansion plans in 2015, redesigning of some facades on the street, and opening of newer outlets, including Superdry in 2015. Other shopping areas in the city centre include Oliver Plunkett St. and Grand Parade. Cork is home to some of the country's leading department stores with the foundations of shops such as Dunnes Stores and the former Roches Stores being laid in the city.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nCork City is a hub of industry in the region. Several pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in the area, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Swiss company Novartis. Perhaps the most famous product of the Cork pharmaceutical industry is Viagra. Cork is also the European headquarters of Apple Inc. where over 3,000 staff are involved in manufacturing, R&D and customer support. Logitech and EMC Corporation are also important IT employers in the area. Three hospitals are also among the top ten employers in the city.The city is also home to the Heineken Brewery that brews Murphy's Irish Stout and the nearby Beamish and Crawford brewery (taken over by Heineken in 2008) which have been in the city for generations. 45% of the world's Tic Tac sweets are manufactured at the city's Ferrero factory. For many years, Cork was the home to Ford Motor Company, which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984. Henry Ford's grandfather was from West Cork, which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in Cork. Technology has since replaced the older manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s, with people now working at a number of IT companies across the city area \u2013 such as Amazon.com, the online retailer, which has offices at Cork Airport Business Park.Cork's deep harbour allows large ships to enter, bringing trade and easy import/export of products. Cork Airport also allows easy access to continental Europe and Cork Kent railway station in the city centre provides good rail links for domestic trade.\n\n\n=== Employment ===\nAccording to the 2011 Cork City Employment & Land Use Survey, the single largest employers in the city (all with over 1,000 employees) include Cork University Hospital, Apple Inc, University College Cork, Boston Scientific, Cork City Council, Cork Institute of Technology, Bon Secours Hospital, Cork, retailers Supervalu and Centra, the Irish Defence Forces at Collins Barracks, and the Mercy University Hospital.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\n\nCork Airport is the second busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and is situated on the south side of Cork city close to Ballygarvan. Nine airlines fly to more than 45 destinations in Europe. Scheduled airlines using Cork airport include Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air, Air France, Flybe, Iberia Express, Ryanair, Swiss International Air Lines and Volotea.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nPublic bus services within the city are provided by the national bus operator Bus \u00c9ireann. City routes are numbered from 201 through to 226 and connect the city centre to the principal suburbs, colleges, shopping centres and places of interest. Two of these bus routes provide orbital services across the Northern and Southern districts of the city respectively. Buses to the outer suburbs and towns, such as Ballincollig, Glanmire, Midleton and Carrigaline are provided from the city's bus terminal at Parnell Place in the city centre. Suburban services also include shuttles to Cork Airport, and a park and ride facility in the south suburbs only.\nLong-distance buses depart from the bus terminal in Parnell Place to destinations throughout Ireland. Hourly services run to Killarney/Tralee, Waterford, Athlone and Shannon Airport/Limerick/Galway and there are six services daily to Dublin. There is also a daily Eurolines bus service that connects Cork to Victoria Coach Station in London via South Wales and Bristol.\nPrivate operators include Irish Citylink, Aircoach and Dublin Coach. Irish Citylink serves Limerick and Galway. Aircoach operates an Express non-stop service which serves Dublin City Centre and Dublin Airport 18 times daily in each direction. Dublin Coach serves Dublin via Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cashel and Cahir.\n\n\n=== Harbour and waterways ===\n\nThe Cross River Ferry, from Rushbrooke to Passage West, links the R624 to R610. This service is used by some commuters to avoid traffic in the Jack Lynch Tunnel and Dunkettle area. The Port of Cork is situated at Ringaskiddy, 16 kilometres (10 miles) SE via the N28. Brittany Ferries operates direct car ferry services from Cork to Roscoff in France.\n\n\n=== Road ===\n\nThe city's road infrastructure improved in the late 20th and early 21st century, including from the early 1980s construction of the Cork South Link dual carriageway which links the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly after, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued on extending the N25 South Ring Road through the 1990s, culminating in the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project \u2013 which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The M8 motorway links Cork with Dublin.\nFrom 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas. Subsequently, in 2014, a public bicycle rental scheme was launched. The scheme is operated by An Rothar Nua on behalf of the National Transport Authority, with funding supplemented by an advertising sponsor. The scheme supports 330 bikes with 31 stations placed around the city for paid public use.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n\n==== Railway and tramway heritage ====\nCork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from Dublin Heuston. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at Blackpool, the route now reaches the city centre terminus of Kent Station via the Glanmire tunnel and Kilnap Viaduct. Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns of Cobh and Midleton east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of Youghal, until the 1980s.\n\nOther rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway, a line to Macroom, the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway to Blarney, Coachford and Donoughmore, as well as the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway connecting Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and many other West Cork towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement).\nWithin the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American George Francis Train in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line.In December 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company began operating on the Blackpool\u2013Douglas, Summerhill\u2013Sunday's Well and Tivoli\u2013Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.\nThe wider city area, including the city's suburbs, is served by three railway stations. These are Cork Kent railway station, Little Island railway station and Glounthaune railway station.\n\n\n==== Current routes ====\nCork's Kent Station is the main railway station in the city. From here, Irish Rail services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to Dublin has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork, and is linked from Limerick Junction with connections to Clonmel and Waterford.

          "I was ambivalent about kissing the stone but saw the line was on the stairs when we got there so it didn't look to be a long wait for the stone. My wife decided to wait as she is not a fan of heights or narrow staircases. As others have mentioned, the long slog up the stairs is",

          "Visited in the middle of winter... Jan/Feb and there were very few people to deal with. The ride to the castle was educational as the drive was giving some of the histories on the are, the castle, the roads leading to the castle as well as some of the surrounding areas.",

          "Our party of six arrived early one hot day in the summer specifically to kiss the Blarney Stone, a family tradition. We entered the castle to the strains of a bagpiper, climbed the narrow staircase and with the assistance of the attendant we were able to position our body to",
          "There are tourist attractions throughout Europe. Churches, historic castles and yes, even DisneyWorld but the most fun we had when we were pictured taking a drink, up side down (with the help of a Blarney guide) at the Blarney Stone. The water tasted like water, but the",
          "Good castle, not really restored much, Just gives you to opportunity to go up and kiss the Blarney stone. No charge that I recall at the castle, but 10E for a picture of you kissing the virus and bacteria covered stone. There was a charge to get into the park.",
          "My wife insisted we visit, I was initially skeptical but must admit that it was fun and definitely worth it",
          "This is a beautiful experience which I highly recommend. The castle, the walk, and the overall atmosphere are amazing. Summer and autumn are my favorite seasons in Ireland to visit.",
          "Advice: Get to the Castle Early. I was there with 5 teenagers (my students) and we waited in line for an hour and 45 mins to kiss the Stone. While I\u2019m glad to have this experience, the line was not worth the wait.",
          "Prior to my first ever trip to Ireland last week, the only thing I knew to do there was to kiss the Blarney stone, so naturally I put it on my list of things to see and do. Judging from the crowds, so do most visitors to Ireland. Fortunately, we went late in the day, which",
          "Everybody goes to kiss the Blarney Stone, but the best feature is the Poison Plant Garden. Take your time, read the explanations, and learn a bit of very interesting History. Who knew???",
          "Excellent bed and breakfast. Sometimes you look at photos and are disappointed when you actually arrive. No this accommodation is first class. Would certainly recommend and if were returning to Cork this would be my first choice. Food was superb. Recommended by the owner to",
          "The grounds are 5 star. Lots and lots to see and very pleasant to walk round. If that is all you go for you'll have a fab day (even though the features are all fakes!). If you want to see Blarney Castle expect to queue (and queue!) Mid week, and only early season the queue to",
          "As you have to lie on your back and hang upside down I found it difficult. I could not go back far enough to reach the stone so didn't actually kiss it. Also I missed taking a photo of my husband doing thus as one of the attendants was yelling at me not to move too close and by",
          "Visited here as part of a tour of Ireland a few years ago...of all my memories of this trip the Blarney Stone was the only disappointment...after queuing you will be held by two men and lowered backwards to kiss the stone, nothing else there so bit of a let down...what I hadn\u2019t",
          "Blarney castle is a must see when in county cork. This was my first castle and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Kissing the stone is an awkward experience but once you get over the fact that thousands of others kissed the stone too it\u2019s well worth the wait. It\u2019s all about the experience!",
          "Who knows if the lump of stone that visitors are lowered precariously to kiss is real and the thing itself is seriously unimpressive, glimpsed briefly upside down as you strain to reach it without falling down the gap in front of it. But who cares, it's one of those things you",
          "One cannot come to Ireland and not visit Blarney castle at least once to see and/or kiss the stone. I was determined not to kiss something that had a thousands kisses applied to it, but ventured up that torturous spiral staircase (no railing just a rope) to the top. Up there,",
          "The castle and grounds are so amazing that I guess you could skip the stone, but why would you? The climb up is not for the faint of heart or those that don't like heights, but put that aside and head on up! The gentlemen that are up there to help you out are there for a",
          "We went to the Blarney Stone and had a very nice time. My group had an agenda which was to kiss the stone and walk around a little and leave. If you want to avoid a line up get there early and during the week. Tour busses come by 10:30 so get there before them and kiss the stone",
          "Well I went all the way to Ireland, so there was no way I wasn't going to at least see it. The castle and grounds are spectacular (I wrote a separate review on those), but the stone itself is right up there with Plymouth Rock. Take a walk up to the top of the castle then take",
          "I have been there for the first time 10 years ago and site was not accommodated as today. And the price was not so high neither. This time as a family (with kids from 6 to 11) we visited the site discovering new stuff. Poison garden is new and the overall garden is also. Great",
          "After a lot of convincing my husband agreed to a 6 hour detour so that I could cross kissing the Blarney Stone off my bucket list. We are touring the castles of Ireland and did not have enough time to include Cork in our original plans but found ourselves with an extra day so",
          "The Blarney Stone itself is difficult to reach without being a contortionist and many people didnt even attempt to kiss it.I should add that despite being easter there where no queues.There isn't a great deal else to the castle although the grounds are extensive with some nice",
          "This was definitely a spot that's been on my bucket list for some time now. My husband however was more interested in the gardens but we both made the trek up the castle to the stone. Now even if you do not kiss the stone, the views from the top are pretty great. And the rooms",
          "Unless you\u2019re a bucket list sort of person I wouldn\u2019t recommend this at all. Hyped up. Fair play to the person who came up with the idea.",
          "Took some visiting friends to kiss the blarney stone. The castle is very authentic with arrow slits and everything still in place. Be aware though that the climb up to the blarney stone involves a very narrow old stone staircase. We didn't have to wait too long to get kissing",
          "If you want to feel how it felt to dwell in an Irish Castle then you need to visit this castle...the grounds are beautiful any time of the year !",
          "We did an October trip to Ireland. It was past the tourist season so most of the Castles and tourist attractions were closed but I did get to see the Blarney Stone and even kissed it. Ireland is a wonderful country to visit. The stories and local input on the place was amusing",
          "We went here in the middle of summer and we thought there would be a lot of people here to Kiss the Blarney Stone but we were so lucky there was only hand full of people here.We climbed to the top of the Castle where the Blarney Stone is you lay down on your back and then you a",
          "This was a great experience we brought some people visiting us to see the famous stone. Great ruins and lots of interesting things to see. Would recommend this for kids too lots of space to run around. Make sure to visit when the weather is nice though.",
          "So... Blarney is a little ways from Dublin, but, it's TOTALLY worth the trip! We did a day trip/tour to Cork, so there were other stops along the way, but the Blarney Castle grounds are beautiful. And we went in January! I can't imagine what it's like in spring! Kissing the",

          "Really enjoyed our visit to Blarney Castle it is definitely worth a visit . The stable yard cafe is really lovely with brilliant staff . Kissing the Blarney Stone was a great experience and there was a photo opportunity. The gift shops had plenty of Irish gifts for every",
          "well worth a visit, interesting castle and gardens, very nice restaurant on site, lovely walks in garden.",
          "This is fun to do just to do it. You have to overcome the angle at which you are put at to kiss it and overcome any germ issues you might have. We came right after a good rain so we can pretend it was somewhat clean lol. Due to the angle at which you are titled, this might rule",
          "We were here just after the worst storm for years - trees down, couldn't visit the gardens so had to settle for just castle and 'the stone' - it has to be done! Quite a hike to the top of the castle with very steep steps but all safe. There are people there to help if you're not",
          "Arriving in Autumn and straight off the jet in Shannon on our way to Cork... and, after more than a dozen trips to Ireland I finally agreed to stop at Blarney Castle and kiss the ol' stone. There are also more than a dozen legends about the stone, most centered on it being a",
          "There were over 125 narrow steps to get to the Blarney Stone. Some people were obviously rather foolish to attempt the climb since there was no turning back. I went up but did not bother kissing the Blarney stone, just wanting to take photos and video. There is not much else to",
          "The origins of the Blarney Stone May be a load of Blarney, but it\u2019s definitely worth doing. The castle it\u2019s self is quite impressive. The stone is high up in the ramparts, but there is someone there to help you. The castle grounds are very well kept. Well worth a visit.",
          "I made my first trip to Blarney castle around 1981 , i came back with a friend in October 2017, The admission fee was 15 euros per head which was almost \u00a315 pound sterling. To say it was over priced would be an understatement and if you are daft enough to pay for the photo at",

          "The story \"kiss the stone\" should be called \"brake your backbone\". But the park has two very nice place : fairy garden and fern tree garden. You have to see them. The castle does not teache you anything and the main house was closed.",
          "The Irish know how to make money. We had to go kiss the blarney stone, and after climbing 100 irregular steps, we made it. Be prepared to lay down on your back and lean way back to kiss this famous rock. A staff will take a picture of this moment for you and you can have it all",
          "This is must see for anyone travelling around the south coast if Ireland. Amazing castle, the stairs are dug into the huge walls of the castle. You go back hundreds of years to medevial times. The kids loved it, all the nooks and crannys to be explored were awesome. And not",
          "This is one of those things you knew about but you thought you'd never do. So if you're in Ireland go do it. You'll walk through beautiful gardens to get to the castle and as you go up the spiral staircase you'll feel butterflies in your stomach. You can have someone take your",
          "This is a very well maintained place. They have parking, coffee shop as well gift shop. The gardens around are very greatly maintained and kept clean. The kissing of stone is very unique experience. The staff was very helpful and encouraging. Would definitely recommend this",
          "Very busy with a queue of about 45 minutes to do what visitors must! Unfortunately one of our party was on crutches so we didn't get to explore the rest of the grounds. What we did see of the gardens were well worth a visit in their own right, and we only saw a small part. If",
          "How can you not kiss the Blarney stone at least once? It's rather kitsch and there are few if any Irish folks bothering to do this. On the other hand, it's a cultural icon and the grounds surrounding the castle and stone are beautiful. So worth the hour-long wait to have",
          "Yes you have to stand line, but you will be able to say you did it. Not for those that have a fear of height as you have to lay on your back and lean back to kiss the stone in the wall. The climb to the top up a narrow spiral staircase so might be difficult for some. The view",
          "So enjoyed our trip to kiss the Blarney Stone! We did a full tour of Ireland and didn't have long but managed to que up and get to the top within an hour. The stairways were quite steep and it was a long way up but so worth it. There were people to help you at the top which was",
          "This is nice to look at, but really isn't worth the heights, flies, wasps, half hour wait to get tickets, 15 euro tickets and a 2 hour wait to get up there.",
          "The grounds were nicely looked after and very clean. Castle was nice and lots of areas to explore on the journey to the top to kiss the stone. Escape route for the faint of heart. The stair cases did get quite tight and steep. Great views from the top.",
          "Of course we went to Blarney Castle! The line may be quite long (30 min to 3 hrs). What is important to realize is that to get to the Blarney stone, you will need to climb approx 12 flights of stone spiral staircase, one that is narrow, irregular and without handrails. Because",

          "If you're in Ireland and in Cork, and have the time, you probably should go kiss the stone. Nothing real special though - seems like a 45 min wait in line, but while waiting you are treated to views of the inside of Blarney castle and up at the top some really nice views of the",
          "Filling your bucket list? Ok, go do it but Ireland has so much more to offer than waiting 45 minutes to climb some stairs and kiss a stone that millions have kissed before. Go to the country and see some beauty. We walked the grounds while our friends kissed the stone. It is",
          "Blarney Castle and 'kissing' the stone was a fantastic moment. We arrived mid afternoon on the most beautiful sunny day. The grounds are impeccable and wonderfully kept. The flowers in bloom were sensational. We lined up for an hour waiting to ascend the very tight spiral",
          "We visited Blarney Castle and the Blarney stone ! Now first let me say this is not for the faint of heart. You walk a distance from the parking area to the Castle. Then you walk up the narrowest staircase you ever saw to get to the top of the Castle where the Blarney stone is. I",
          "We visited at around 4pm early in July and it was PERFECT timing. There were no bus tours at the venue and although there were people around it felt quiet and intimate. I am guessing that the tour buses came earlier in the day and had left by 4pm. The grounds and gardens were",
          "I recently went to this attraction since it's one of the things you are supposed to see in Ireland. If I had to do this again, I'd skip it. The grounds that the castle are on are lovely but it's not worth the money or time to stand in line for hours to go up to the top of the",
          "Amazing experience, once in a lifetime. Wasn't expecting such beautiful gardens. The main side of the castle was covered in white plastic and scaffolding which was disappointing. A warning at the entry would've been nice. Still able to take good photos though from a different",
          "The castle and stone was where my heritage drew me but the Viator guide Gabriel put it way \"over the top\"!!",
          "So touristy. I enjoyed the castle and grounds very much. But, if you have to wait more than 10 minutes to kiss the stone, forget it. Most of the time, the people in front of us, just kissed the bricks on top of the stone. You really have to bend backwards and lean down a lot to",
          "This was a tour well worth the time and money! The guides watched over us every step of the way and knew where we were at all times, and ensured our comfort. They showed equal concern for families, single travelers and small groups alike. We started in Dublin and took the train",
          "We were here in June of this year. There are LOTS of people in June. Be prepared to stand in line for a long time. You have to climb many steep, narrow steps and are very enclosed. There were so many people here that every step up had a person on it. It was still fun. If",

          "This was a quick visit on our way to our next destination. We decided to go straight to the castle to queue to kiss the Blarney Stone. It took us 40 minutes to reach the top by a narrow circular staircase. Cameras, glasses etc have to be removed before sitting down. You hold",
          "Blarney Castle was a nice stop on the first day of our tour. We had a great lunch at the Blarney Woolen Mills Cafe. Then we walked to the castle and enjoyed the beautiful grounds. We did not walk up to the Blarney Stone it was not something that we chose to do. But we enjoyed",
          "Of course kissing the Blarney Stone is an Ireland must do activity. Luckily, I didn't look up from the ground before climbing the castle steps or I probably would have chickened out. We had a long line, at least 45 minutes, but the climb is through the castle, which is fun and",
          "I've been told a already possess the 'gift of the gab' but gave the stone a kiss anyway, just for fun and why not while you are visiting the castle. Beautiful castle amongst some wonderful gardens.",

          "If you are going to the Blarney Castle and Gardens, you must go to the top of the castle to kiss the Blarney Stone. A tight, twisty squeeze to the top and back with very uneven steps. Do not attempt this if you have trouble with your hips, knees or back and especially do not go",
          "This place is huge with lots to do if you do not mind walking. The main attraction would be the castle and walking to the top. Just make sure you are not to large or tall and it should be an easy walk up to the top. The castle stairs are really tight. They also have beautiful",
          "If you are going to kiss the Blarney Stone get there first thing in the morning, no wait. The tour buses are not there yet. You can then spend the rest of day exploring the gardens.",
          "The weather was perfect when I visited. The gardens are exceptional and spring is the most perfect time to visit. To get to the top of the castle to see the stone is a bit of a climb but well worth it and the castle has lots of beautiful nooks and crannies. Dont forget if",
          "Allow yourself enough time to tour the beautiful gardens. We arrived approximately 30 minutes before closing and barely had enough time to climb the spiral staircase to kiss the stone. The view from The top of the castle is absolutely breathtaking!",
          "We almost skipped the Blarney Castle and kissing the Blarney Stone for fear it would be altogether hokey, but it was a lot of fun! You have to lie down on your back, grab two vertical bars and actually slide downwards upside down in order to kiss the famed Blarney Stone... and",
          "We visited Blarney Castle on April 12, 2017. This was not our first visit, but it was a first for my kids. They really enjoyed climbing the spiral staircase and kissing the Blarney Stone. Walking around the various rooms and viewing the countryside from the top was really",

          "We came here with extreme Ireland day tours. The grounds are huge and I wish we would have had more time to explore. The line for the Stone was about 45 mins long when we got to it and about 2 hours long by the time we left. The stairs going up are very tiny-it almost makes you",
          "Spent a Sunday here. Absolutely beautiful to walk around and explore. Staff were very friendly and encourage my friend to kiss the Blarney Stone (she is terrified of heights). Don't think it would be enjoyable on a wet or windy day.",

          "We went in January when it was very quiet with no queues so we were stunned when we were charged \u20ac30 entrance for the two of us. I wonder do locals pay the same price? We tried to bargain but the desk lady was having none of it! The grounds were lovely to walk around in but I",
          "We loved everything about Ireland except for a contrary Leprechaun on the street in Dublin who refused to let us take a pic unless we paid him up front! The Blarney Stone is a bit of a gimmick, but hey, if you go to Ireland you have to kiss the Blarney Stone!",
          "The Blarney Stone is extremely mythological and it's at the top of the Blarney Castle. It's a tight spiral staircase to the top and the touristic thing to do is to lean backwards over a wall, extend one's arms, arch over and kiss the stone. The price for a pic is \u20ac35. I did not",
          "You hear about the Blarney stone all of your life and this was less than impressive. The castle itself is really small and really the hype is to get you to the top to kiss the Blarney stone. The stone is not remarkable and not even distinguished well. The workers at the top",
          "Went on a group tour with family. The floors of the castle are non existent and you have to walk along an edge to reach the top. Learned my 10 is afraid of heights. Made it too the top where you can kiss the stone for good luck. Great experience.",
          "After climbing up stairs to the top of the castle we got to Kiss the Stone. For those of heights like myself I conquered that fear. I visited in with a bunch of friends and had a great time. Love the castle and the stone.",
          "We visited Ireland in September/October, 2016 and rented a car to drive all over this beautiful country. When we got to the town of Blarney (which was quite nice!) we drove to Blarney Castle (which was a highlight of the trip). Once inside Blarney Castle we trekked up the stairs",

          "The Blarney Castle and grounds are definitely a worthwhile visit. I have seen many castles and while Blarney is not the most well preserved (Warwick in the UK tops my list) it has a nice grounds and gardens area. Kissing the Blarney Stone is, of course, a popular reason to",

          "The path leading to the stone is magical! First after paying admission you go through a beautiful garden reaching the castle Than You go through the castle up a circle narrow steps up up up to the roof! The View is beautiful & the scene is astonishing! Cows, green fields, farms",
          "This was my second time kissing the Blarney Stone. I found that visiting this attraction during the weekend was much quieter than at the weekend. It is also a good idea to go early. It was 13 euro of an adult to visit the castle and grounds. Just be careful as the stone spiral",
          "You are always told about leaning back to kiss the stone, you are not told about standing side by side on a narrow spiral staircase!! It definitely is an experience and its a relief to get to the top! It is a great attraction well organised with lovely gardens! I loved the craft",

          "This was a must ! The surroundings are great ! The castle is incredible ! The Ascension is incredible , one has to be fit ! The number of tiny thin stairs is enormous , the kissing is perilous but worth it ! I am expecting great changes in my life after this perilous kiss !!",
          "It was a damp and cool spring day to start. When we walked to the castle I looked up and thought, I'll never make it. I have some mobility and height issues. My husband was up on top in 5 minutes and was waving me on. He came down and guided me up the winding and open",
          "Beautiful grounds around the Castle very well kept. The castle itself is a beautiful sight. Don't br discouraged by the line to kiss the stone. I think it was worth waiting. Fun.",
          "I was reticent about visiting what I thought would be a truly 'touristy' castle and noted as one of the '100 things you must do before you die' list. Wrong.. We arrived right on opening time which was smart given the number of tourist buses that arrived just a few minutes",
          "When we went it was 1.5 hour line to kiss the stone and the line weaves through the castle, so you cannot see the inside of the castle without getting in the line. It was well worth the wait though to see the castle and kiss the stone. When we asked the teller he said that the",
          "I do not believe people urinate on it, due to the fact that it is at least 3 stories high,it is also a very narrow staircase and most likely locked at night. It is another place you can say you have visited.",
          "As others have said the Blarney stone is a small part of this place. The 60 Acres and beautiful gardens are truly the highlight. Its a peaceful place to wander and take in the beauty.",
          "We made an unscheduled stop to see the Blarney Stone. We were really glad we did. It was an unique experience well worth the wait in line. We highly recommend it.",
          "Why go to Ireland and not kiss the Blarney Stone? The climb to the stone is a little precarious. Be sure to wear comfortable and appropriate footwear. The climb consists of several tight spiral staircases with minimal hand holds and you could potentially be standing in a line",
          "Why visit Ireland and not kiss the Blarney Stone? Well I had to do this. What a fun activity. We had about 3 hours here. We booked a tour group for our daily trip. I recommend heading to the Blarney Stone immediately. We didn't have a long line. During the warmer months you",
          "Set in beautiful grounds, with interesting tales to match. The trek up the tower to kiss the Blarney Stone is by narrow steps, so ensure you've got suitable footwear, and if you're squeamish about putting your lips where the thousands of others have take some cling film or buy",
          "Yes, definitely worth a visit and the hike to the top. The stairs are rather narrow - I'm a size 2 and was afraid I'd get stuck going up! Not for the claustrophobic but worth the short queue to kiss the magic stone.",
          "My friends had gone to Blarney Stone on a rainy day in January and weren't thrilled with the experience, so I didn't know what to expect when I went there; however, I visited on a sunny day in February and loved it. I was surprised by how much there was to do: you can explore",
          "I was a little bit underwhelmed. Famous for being famous. I am sorry to be such a negative, but I was not impressed. I guess it's just one of those things you do. The thing that I found repulsive was that it was covered with fresh lipstick and weetness from other people's",
          "The castle and grounds are impressive, admittedly your paying a higher entry fee than other similar spots in the Ireland because of the lip puckering chance. Even on a very wet winter day there was more tourists here than we saw in our driving around Ireland.... MILES more.",
          "What a great experience! The grounds are vast & beautiful. You can spend a great deal of time exploring & MUST climb all,the way the castle to kiss the Blarney Stone.",
          "Let me preface that I am rather afraid of heights. You meander your way through the castle looking at the different rooms and their uses. It feel old and medieval. You eventually make your way to the top to stand in line to kiss the stone. There is a nice view up there, and the",
          "What a great place to visit! The gentleman holding you while you kiss the stone was fantastic and fun! The gal selling the pictures at the bottom was great! It's definitely a climb to the top and very enclosed but we'll worth it! I don't know if we ever did find the waterfall",
          "As a group of men on a stag do of course the single ones would like the gift of the gab! Legend says that who kisses the stone will have good luck with the ladies/men. To be honest it may have worked as the single lads had lots of luck in Cork that night! There's lots to do at",
          "The trip to the Blarney Stone was something we were told we had to do. We did stop in town for a pint which was nice and enjoyed the grounds and castle. This is certainly a lovely experience but it felt very touristy especially with the photography that takes place as you are",
          "This is definitely a wonderful place to visit. The walk leading up to the Blarney Stone has such beautiful scenery. The castle is nice. I could not kiss the Blarney Stone due to a boot on my right foot. I did like that there was a store to buy gifts. Worth a visit.",
          "I had told everyone I was definitely going to kiss the stone, that was before I saw the height and the narrow staircase. However, I decided just to go for it and luckily for me there was not a sole in front of me so no waiting on the stairs, which did get very narrow and steep",
          "We toured around Ireland for my daughter's 22nd birthday and visiting Blarney Castle was one of our highlights! There were very few people exploring the castle when we arrived around noon. The windy, narrow stone staircase leading up to the top of the castle is very steep! (If",
          "You have to be fit to climb the spiral stairs but views from the top of the tower were great. Lines moved quickly , and a bit rushed and don't think I actually kissed the stone as a bit nerve wracking hanging backwards out over the edge but something to talk about. The grounds",
          "A trip too Ireland would not be complete without one kissing the Blarney Stone. The 1-2 hour trip up to the stone is not really boring, as views,of the gardens, from various floors are spectacular. The opportunity to see and read about the castle, as one climbs the stairs makes",
          "This is something that I have wanted to do since I was a child. Being from an Irish background I knew lots of people who had done this so I was quite excited when I was going to Cork for a wedding knowing I could knock this one off my bucket list. It did not disappoint. To kiss",
          "After I misplaced photos of me kissing the Blarney Stone I queried the Woolen Mills restaurant we ate at, the tour operator and hotel I stayed at hoping they were there. They were not. So I called the Blarney Stone and explained my plight. They searched their lost and found",
          "Just getting to the Blarney Stone is a challenge. If you're not very sure footed or frightened of heights this is not for you. To get to the stone you have to climb through the castles towers. The steps are narrow, sometimes steep and there's very little support. Once up the top",
          "Really nice gardens around the stone, nice walks around waterfalls! Kissed the stone was a bit scary don't do it if you don't like heights!",
          "This is a good place to visit as long as you don't mind heights & laying on your back with a big drop behind your head. There are guys there to hold you & help you. It's a fun experience kissing the stone which is high up in the battlements. Great views of the grounds below.",
          "You'll see no Europeans in this crowd. They have castles in their countries. With that said you can chat with alot of fellow americans, aussies, canadians. Didn't realize how high this damn stone was. Although the risk of falling is minimal to none, leaning backwards over a",
          "This was a great experience. The castle is so unique and beautiful. The stairs are a bit slim but there are hand rails on both sides which were useful. Every so often the stairs would lead to a room that you could go into to have a rest. Very interesting place to explore.",
          "Set in lovely gardens, the Blarney Castle is a great day out ... no only do you get the gilf of the gab after kissing the stone, you also get to enjoy the lovely views from the top and the beautiful gardens.",
          "Do you really want to lay and your back on the ground with the top half of your body hanging out over the edge and then arch up and kiss a stone that hundreds of others in the line before you have already kissed? No thanks but the view from the top is worth the climb.",
          "This was the longest line-up of all the attractions we went to see in our complete tour of Ireland. The enclosed spiral staircase gets narrower and narrower the higher you get; not for anyone with bad knees or fear of tight spaces (or heights).",
          "Growing up Irish in Boston, I had always heard of the Blarney Stone and how you had to kiss it to obtain the 'gift of gab'. My ancestors came to American from Cork, Ireland so it was ironic that this was the place where I finally put my feet on the 'old sod'. Getting from the",
          "You just can't come and not kiss the Blarney Stone. Yes you will need to wait in line and climb many stairs but the view from the top is worth it. And since you have come this far, go ahead and lie down, beck over backwards and kiss the stone. There is always someone there to",
          "Beautiful area! Luckily I was advised by locals the day before, NOT TO KISS THE STONE as locals go pee on it. Definitely don't do that lol.",
          "If you travel to Ireland you have to Kiss the Blarney Stone.......so this is a must stop on your journey. If you read some of the reviews it sounds like a daunting climb to the top but it is not. It is actually a very easy climb and the views from the top are to die",
          "After walking up a very narrow winding spiral staircase I felt i needed oxygen when I eventually reached the top To kiss the Blarney Stone is not an east task if you are under 6ft I am only 5ft 2in so lying on my back to kiss that stone is a terrifying experience You lie down",
          "When I think of Ireland I think of leprechaun, shamrock, pubs and the Blarney Stone to name a few. The Blarney Stone has no real historical significance but the story is magical and so Irish. The crowds are by the bus loads though! The grounds are beautiful so you could spend a",
          "Blarney is a wonderful place to visit not only the castle, the blarney stone, but the sprawling grounds around it! we brought a picnic and enjoyed some food and wine after we walked the grounds. there is a poison garden, waterfall, caves, and more to see. definitely a place",
          "After paying your fee to enter Blarney Castle & Gardens, and hiking up 127 steps, you reach the Blarney Stone. And then a couple of entrepreneurial looking guys charge you to kiss the Blarney Stone. You have to lay down on your back, bend backwards, holding out your arms to",
          "Lots to do here, not just kissing the Blarney Stone which you must do. Got there fairly early and after climbing the stairs, which really wasn't bad at all, only had to wait about 15 minutes to do the deed! Get a picture afterwards for 12 euros, well worth it to memorialize",
          "Visited the castle and Blarney Stone. There is a lot to do in the grounds and could easily spend half a day there. Recommend.",
          "A little more exciting than perhaps one may expect. Walk up the castle to the Blarney Stone may be a little challenging for some, but generally it\u2019s ok. Kissing the Blarney Stone is a little more exciting than you might think, as you lay on your back, grab some hand rails,",
          "This was an amazing place. Worth seeing at least once in your life. One thing is the stone is not accessible for handicapped. You do need to lay on your back and hold on to the 2 bars and kiss it. Also, it is quite a hike of spiral stairs to reach the very top and if you are",
          "Fortunately the weather was on the cool side or it may have been more difficult to climb over 100 steps. If you have a below average lung capacity this may not be the excursion for you! If you are able to go at a slow pace & you don't have people behind you then it's possible to",
          "You travel all the way to Ireland, be anywhere near the blarney stone and not go see it. I have heard the wait can get long, but we lucked out and our wait was short. They will take a picture of you kissing the stone and you can buy it afterwards. I can't remember exactly how",
          "We kissed the Blarney stone. Awesome view from the top of the castle. Kissing the stone was more changing than we thought. Seeing the Castle and learning the history was well worth the time.",
          "Blarney Castle is beautiful. Kissing the stone is a must. The queue can get long, we had an hour of a wait but worth persevering. You can see people kissing the stone from the bottom and it looks scary but its not half as bad up there. The guys are very friendly at the top and",
          "A lovely experience. Lovely gardens and scenery. Wear comfortable shoes to walk around the area. Beautiful small waterfalls. Cheap entry. If you do want to kiss the blarney stone get there early to avoid disappointment. The queue was at least an hour wait inside a tower on the",
          "Worth the wait and the climb. They do charge you admission and you should tip the holder (he holds you out so you can kiss the stone) and they will take photos for you. Then you have to pay again for the certificate and photos, but its worth it. The climb is long, and there is",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone is a must if you are in southern Ireland . Its seems higher than the pictures show and you have to lay on your back and lean out but they are holding you up. Kind of scary.",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone is a must for every visitor to Ireland. The climb up 5 stories of narrow spiral stairs is surprisingly easy; it helps to be in a lineup. You have to lie on your back and look up to kiss the stone but it is impossible to fall, even without someone",
          "Interesting. You have to hang upside down to kiss the stone. They push you through pretty quick. The castle is cool but the gardens are even more so. You could spend a whole day wandering around between this and the woolen mills.",
          "Probably you'll end up queuing for a little while towards the top of Blarney Castle, but this is a bit of fun that you shouldn't miss. There were a couple of charming gents up there, one is the official photographer and the other guides you into the right position to kiss the",
          "It is quick, silly, but still something I felt I had to do once I got the idea. You will wait for quite a while in line, but usually the weather is decent enough and the people around you are in such a good mood that you do not mind, but it does take some time. I waited in line",
          "Travelling to the Blarney Stone is worth the trip. The grounds are beautiful and walking up to the castle gives you a feeling of going back in time. Imagining the battles that took place here and seeing how people lived is like nothing I've ever seen. The gardens are",
          "When in Ireland ... We visited on a Saturday in July. It was extremely busy with bus loads of tourists and a cruise ship in town. Granted not everyone actually climbs the staircase to the stone. It was still a two hour time commitment from first lining up to coming down out",
          "The old castle has floor less rooms & a winding spiral staircase which requires some balance & bravery as you make your ascent. It was made easier by the queue up to the top but uber worth it & although I am not sure I have become more eloquent after kissing the stone but it was",
          "Even if you're not Irish, kissing the Blarney Stone is a must do for anyone who believes in magic. The grounds of the castle are just breathtaking and once you climb the stairs to the Blarney Stone, the vista will take your breath away. The stairs may be a challenge to some,",
          "Went up the long stair case, along side a million other people, kissed the stone, had my photo taken - but decided it was an ok day, oh yes it rained alot",
          "There is no doubt you must visit the Blarney Stone and kiss it! The grounds leading to the Blarney Stone are beautiful and the castle is real! Ireland was on my bucket list and I had to do every iconic thing I had ever heard about Ireland. Some may think this is a little",
          "We did a driving tour of Ireland and just had to visit Blarney Castle. We had to go up a lot of steps but this was worth it. Along the way up the stairs you can go off into rooms of the castle and then go back and go up more stairs. It felt like most people just chose to",
          "We arrived just after they opened as we were camping nearby so we missed all the tour buses, at 9.30am there were no queues at all and we went straight up to kiss the stone. It was scarier than it looks but it's one of those things you just have to do!",
          "While traveling through Ireland, I had to stop and kiss the Blarney Stone. The line was long, but it moved fast. It was still worth the wait. If you travel through Ireland, the Blarney Stone needs to be on the list.",
          "We stopped here around 4:00 in the afternoon and went right up to the top to kiss the stone no wait at all. After that we strolled around the beautiful grounds which we practically had to ourselves.",
          "Got to kiss the stone during my wife and my trip driving around Ireland. We went right before closing time and got to see everything without the crowd. The caves under the castle and the poison garden was rally cool to see. This was one of the only castles that we paid to go",
          "Our tour stopped at Blarney Castle. We walked around the grounds and into the bottom floor of the castle. Because of our age, we did not climb the stairs to the Blarney Stone. We were able to view the opening for the stone from the ground.",
          "I wasn't sure how to rate it. Of course everyone wants to kiss the blarney stone but it is difficult to get to it. I really wanted to kiss the blarney stone but it was a 125 steps up once you were in the Castle and the walk up to the castle was a pretty high graded hill to get",
          "Great experience however not for those in fear of heights, small spaces, or germs. A lot of small steps in a mostly confined space only to reach the top and kiss a castle wall that thousands of others have kissed ;) On a lighter note my family and I laughed most of the way up",
          "At top of blarney castle \u20ac13 admission, very steep steps up to it, not recommended if claustrophobic to scared of heights, quite a scary experience kissing the stone, but you don't have to do this",
          "This is a great experience but there can be long waits.We went early and people flowed through easily.You can look at the gardens after the experience and that is well worthy of the time.The other trap appears to be if cruise ships are in,the waiting time can really blow",
          "I was not going to kiss the Blarney stone, but once I got up to the top of the castle, my thoughts of all the germs left me and I just did it! So glad I did! They take a great picture of you doing it, that you are able to purchase at the bottom of the castle! So much history",
          "it seemed silly, but the experience was worth the wait in line. You get to meander up the staircase and view the actual rooms and take breathtaking photos. As you climb higher, the beauty alone is well worth your time. The line went pretty fast, however. maybe 20 minute",
          "Recently visited Ireland and wen to the Blarney Stone Castle. You must cllimb approx. 150 steps to get to the top. The stairs get narrower as you climb up. It was well worth it. In order to kiss the stone. --- you lay down and put your ahead over the side and kiss up toward",
          "As tourists we had heard about kissing the stone, which is really good fun. The castle and grounds are also good fun to explore. Many photo oppurtunity were had, as well as the perfect photo kissing the stone.",
          "As you go along the steep stairs ( small steps because I have big feet! ), you'll notice a lot of written names and words engraved on the castle stone walls. It got me thinking tourists doesn't have the time to do this, those names or words were there hundreds of years ago. I",
          "To visit this is a waste of time and effort! It was difficult to find the right road to get to the village of Blarney from Cork! The massive queue and the numerous steep steps to reach the top of the old castle ruin was a let down once reached! You have to lay down and reach",
          "A friend told us it was boring and she didnt go up into the tower when she visited. So, we almost skipped it. Thank goodness we didn't! It was the best part of the trip so far. The stairs were not that steep nor did it seem that there were as many as reported. We made it up and",
          "The castle was honestly one of my favorites in SW Ireland. We went at 3:00 on a thursday and there was virtually no line (4 people in front of us). The grounds were bigger than I anticipated so give yourself at least a couple of hours to explore.",
          "Visited on a sunny view so the castle was stunning from ground level and from its top down. Surrounding gardens are worth a walk through by themselves. Effort to scale the 14th century castle to kiss the stone was an effort but well worth it. Its a must do.",
          "What a beautiful place! I was petrified kissing the stone,you do this backwards!!! glad to say I came out in one piece. Everyone was so helpful and the views are simply stunning. Im so glad that I made it to Blarney the castle was beautiful. The little town has an array of shops",
          "One of the most terrifying yet amazing things i have ever done in my live. There is nothing like laying over a hole, backwards, high up in the air, to kiss a stone. The castle is amazing and the gardens are a nice relaxing walk. This is a Must See.",
          "It's a stunning setting, the grounds are beautiful and the castle is picturesque. Three of us kissed the stone, aged 7 years to 60. We loved the climb up the stairs and the view of the property from the top of the castle. The kiss itself was nice, as others say they help you",
          "I kissed the Blarney Stone! Absolutely gorgeous area of the country. Worth the historic visit. Rolling green lawns, a river running thru. You will see wedding couples being photographed and horseback riders on the grounds.",
          "We went on a family vacation. 4 years old through 40. There are stairs to climb, and the stone seems anticlimactic, but you won't regret it! Even the 8 year old kissed it.",
          "This is a very picturesque area and surprisingly serine! The Blarney Stone itself seems a bit of a sham with regards to getting a picture of it with a guy it, that and it really does look like the rest of the castle. We really enjoyed the views of the castle, the river walk and",
          "We visited the Castle and the Blarney Stone because after all, you can't go to Ireland without visiting it, right? Actually it was better than we expected. The grounds are beautiful and even though it was January, they were pretty and well manicured. The castle is amazing and",
          "Tourist trap but something you have to do. Castle grounds are completely worth visiting so stop by the stone on your way through :-)",
          "My grandma used to always say 'When you go to Ireland, you must kiss the Blarney Stone' and that is exactly what I did. It's easy to get to Blarney Castle from the central bus station in Cork. The return ticket is about nine euro for an adult, but your ticket can be used on any",
          "11 th century. Preserved well. Great signage. Great stories. Fun destinations ( Kiss the historic Barney stone at the 5 story top) a true poison garden. No way ! Yes way! A super fern garden/ waterfall. A cave ! Magical grounds. Irish gardens. A Himalayas trek hike.Niiiice",
          "I had always heard about the Blarney Stone, and this is something that I wanted to do. If you are not able to climb a lot of steps - then this isn't for you, though. The steps to the top are very steep and narrow. There wasn't too much of a wait, but the actual kiss takes",
          "There was a lot to see here even in winter. The manor was closed but the castle and grounds were open. Plenty of stuff to take pictures of. The walk to the top was narrow. After climbing those stairs leaning over to kiss the stone made me dizzy. There was no wait so perhaps in",
          "Kissing the Blarney Stone was simply on my list of things to do in Ireland. The castle and the grounds were very nice and I enjoyed my visit. Nice view from the top of the castle. A buddy and I took a taxi from downtown Cork to visit the site. We just wanted to do a quick visit",
          "If in ireland this is a must see and do, its a little difficult to actually kiss the Blarney Stone but you have to give it a try !",
          "Scary enough with the big drop beneath the stone, but good for some culture and a laugh with friends! Would recommend!",
          "Kissed the Blarney Stone and now I am \"cursed\" with the gift of gab. One of those things you can say you did once at a St. Patricks Day party.",
          "Okay, to some it may be just a stone but it's all in good fun whether you believe in its magical powers or not. Besides, where else could you kiss a stone by dangling off battlements while a kind Irishman holds on to your legs?",
          "What beautiful grounds the Blarney Castle has! We thoroughly enjoyed our walk from the entrance to the actual castle and stone. Getting to the stone entails climbing some narrow stone steps but we are of just average fitness and had no difficulty. Although to kiss the stone",
          "My wife and I did this while we were on our honeymoon on the CIE Taste of Ireland Tour. To the people who say it is a crumbled down castle and it is actually 109 narrow steps. The castle was rebuilt in 1446, of course it is dated and it is a castle how else could you get to the",
          "This was my second visit to the Blarney Stone and my first in summer. I would recommend going in summer as the surrounding gardens are beautiful in the summer and worth exploring. It is a bit of a climb up the castle to be able to kiss the stone and not recommended to those who",
          "Not an easy feat for me, as I am acrophobic. After ascending a very narrow circular staircase, that seemed to take forever, our group reached the top. ( If you are claustrophobic, this might bother you). Each person lays on their back, and moves backwards by pulling on two",
          "The visit thru the floors was a highlight of the Ireland trip. The views tremendous. It was worth the hike to the roof to see what the Blarney Stone was about but once there the line being hustled in position,photo, and out seemed very commercial ... Still worth it. Look up what",
          "fantastic if that is what you came for, being from Canada and Irish heritage it was exactly what I wanted and expected, yes beware that it is a steep narrow stair way up so I could see people getting frustrate, after kissing the stone no I do not have the talk of the tongue now",
          "Of course you have to do this if given the opportunity! Even though it is the 2nd germiest place in the world! You walk up some stairs, lie on your back, kiss the stone, get a pic taken with the option of purchasing, then you're rushed away. I went when it wasn't real busy and",
          "the gardens are wonderful! The Blarney Stone is fun and lives up to its reputation, if a bit over publicized. It is fun, but a tough walk up the 110 steps in the turret. Atypical old castle, if yo havent been to 10 others by this time, you ca see the castle, have some",
          "All and all one must climb the stairs to get to the top but it is worth it. You must lie on your back and arch your head to kiss it. It was a good thing I travel with my Chiropractor,",
          "Entering into the grounds Blarney castle soon appears set on the hill. we made our way up the path, joining the queue to enter the castle. It was up the steep steps hanging onto the rope rail. Upon reaching the top there was time to appreciate the gardens and grounds. Then it",
          "I think we came at the right time of year! Mid week in the middle of September. We had a wonderful sunny day and the castle looked truly spectacular. There is so much incredible history to this place and I had no idea how long it stretched back until I got here. To be honest, I",
          "We went to Scotland and Ireland one year ago. One of the stops on our tour was the Blarney Stone and we thoroughly enjoyed climbing the stairs to the top of the castle! We could really see the countryside from the top AND the thrill of laying on our backs while someone held",
          "I won't lie, the whole 'kissing the Blarney Stone' experience was completely different to what I was expecting but it made it all the more exciting! We were staying about a half hour from the castle so googled the night before opening times and arrive right as it opened. The",
          "I just had to climb up to the top to see what the fuss was about. The climb to the top is a little challenging and might no be for all people. When at the top the view is great in all directions and you get time due to the number of people cueing to kiss the stone. At the",
          "Worth the wait - but go early when that open and avoid the wait. Receive the gift of the gab from one of the best Irish villages! Take time to visit Blarney Woolen Mills and all the other great places in town - stay overnight!",

          "is if you kissed the Blarney Stone. If you can get past the 100 or so stone circular stairs from the 1600s to get to the top (sounds worse than they are), go for it. There are lots of ropes and rails to hold on to, keep both hands free if you can for safety going up. Several",

          "We agree it is touristy, but it is a must see also the gardens as well. The whole experience is well worth it. We had a slight bit of rain but it did not dull the spirit of anyone in the line. The line moves at a steady pace despite the steps up the tower There is live music",
          "Sure its 100% touristy but it makes such a great story. Besides, the trip there and back is most of the fun. If it all possible I recommend renting/hiring a car and making a day trip of it (or longer and follow the Ring of Kerry) and just stop along the way whenever you feel",
          "Ok, so this is a tourisy thing to do but it was also one of our favorites for a couple of reasons. First, it's iconic for Ireland and it's fun to say that we experienced it. Second, the fun of exploring an old castle made it worth it for us. There is nothing inside this",
          "It was a narrow climb up the castle tower and even though I suffer from claustrophobia I was fine because there was plenty of light and ventilation. View from the top was spectacular. The 'kiss' must be done although you need to be quite flexible and not scared of heights. The",

          "It was a fair bit of money to get in and there were a lot of families that come so the line can get long (so I recommend you get there as early as possible). The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The stairs inside the castle are a bit claustrophobic, so be mindful of that.",
          "First of all, the castle ruins and surrounding gardens are pretty spectacular. That said, the thing to do there, it seems, is to kiss the Blarney Stone at the top of the castle. Be forewarned: Getting to the top is not for the fainthearted. The Stone is at the top of the 90-foot",
          "We did not find out until we had arrived that the steps going up to the Blarney stone were 120 and you also had to come down the same amount. Apparently they narrow near the top and are a little difficult to navigate. That left me out although I thought the price for a crumbled",

          "This castle doesn't need a review. It is a beautiful old castle situated in beautiful surrounds and you get to lay down backwards over a 25 odd metre drop and kiss a stone that makes you more eloquent! Do yourself a favour and just do it!",
          "as a kid, my mother had alwasy said she would like to kiss the Blarney stone - she never made it to Ireland but I got the chance and took it. We timed it right - there was no lineup and the walk up was fun - the stone itself turned out to be the wall of the castle (I didn't",
          "This place is well worth a 4-6 hour visit. The grounds and flowers are just as magnificent as the old castle . you will actually be allowed inside the castle to wander around and see just how they lived back in those days. Dont expect to see fine furnisings because it is bare.",
          "This was my favorite thing we did/saw during our vacation in Ireland! It was so amazing and beautiful. The castle is awesome, but the grounds are also outstanding! Make sure to walk around on some of the trails as there's so much to see!",
          "Certainly touristy but worth the trip. The castle sits on beautiful grounds, but so do many in Ireland. We made the trek dutifully as it was recommended. Kissing the Blarney Stone which is the advertised highlight was a commercial production. You climb up through the castle and",
          "The gardens are wonderfully kept and offer a number of walks. The castle itself is well preserved with a guide on each room offering more information on the history of the castle. The stone is located at the top of the castle, but the best part is the walk through the castle.",
          "My wife and I were on a tour, joining 43 others. It's one of those things that if you are in Ireland, you simply MUST come here. Beautiful gardens to walk to the Blarney Castle, and then ... The Blarney stone is all the way to the very top, via 100 steps or so up a winding",
          "The gardens you walk through to get to the castle are absolutely beautiful. We walked up through the castle to kiss the Blarney Stone. We didn't realize how small the steps are and how narrow the staircase would be! I'm afraid of heights, so it was a bit of a challenge for me.",
          "The line for kissing the Blarney Stone wrapped throughout the castle and out the outer wall, around the tree... An hour twenty later, I was kissing the stone. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY!!!! While your group is in line outside the walls, go see the Poison Garden around the",

          "Beautiful old castle with the main attraction of the Blarney Stone. If you believe in the myth, then you need to kiss the stone. If you already have the Blarney in you don't need to kiss the stone and save yourself an overdose.",
          "Between my mother, my sister and I, I was the only one who was able to walk to the top of the castle to partake in the activity of kissing the Blarney Stone. There is a lot of walking to the castle, but the difficult part was the walk up the narrow stone stairs to the top.",
          "Had alot of fun. The only down side is all those stairs!! OMG they seem to never end! The castle is really nice, almost every floor has a walk off to go look around at the rooms. They have updated alot. No wait to kiss the stone, and yes I DID!!",
          "I took the bus from Cork to Blarney Castle. It was a quick 20 minute ride and only cost \u20ac6 round trip. The cost to get in was \u20ac12 and they only accepted cash. The castle is right around the cirner from the bus stop. The grounds are beautiful. Unfortunately I did not allow enough",
          "beautiful grounds, if the weather is good you could spend a day there. the house was closed for the season but the castle is stunning, its a steep and at times arkward climb to the top but my 84 year old mum did it! she didnt kiss the stone this time as she did it some years ago",
          "We absolutely loved the Blarney Castle tour. The castle was impressive and the grounds surrounding it were gorgeous. A must do is the climb to the top to kiss the Blarney stone or just look and take pictures from the top. Its a slow walk to the top but worth doing. There is",
          "Blarney was one of the best places to visit in Ireland. It's so much more than just kissing the stone, there is Blarney House, where the family still live and in which you can take a tour of this beautiful mansion, as well as the poison and rock garden and the beautiful grounds.",
          "My friend and I feared visiting the Blarney Castle and kissing the Blarney stone was going to be very disappointing: a huge tourist attraction with little to attract those truly seeking to see the worthwhile sites. Nevertheless, a must, we visited - and we were pleasantly",

          "I was lucky to visit Blarney Castle on a very quiet day, early in the morning when there were no queues and it was wonderful to admire the winding staircase and great views of the garden from the top. However, I really couldn't get myself to lean backwards over this gap / drop",
          "The grounds are beautiful. The view at the top...great! Climbing the stone winding narrow stairs with no hand rails can be a challenge. But definately worth doing. When we went it was a crowded day with three bus loads of tourist, mostly over 60. So it took an hour to climb",
          "Once you make your way to and through the castle up to the tower, you will (probably) step out to a line of guests waiting their turn to kiss the stone. The line moves quickly and along the way are plaques with information to read about the Blarney Stone. There is a gentleman",

          "An inspiring place to visit, not just to climb up and risk life and limb to kiss the stone, but to walk thtrough the beautiful grounds and learn of the tales of mystery and intrigue about various stones and caves, beware the witches, they are watching, awesome place.",

          "Beautiful grounds with flowers everywhere! Neat places everywhere you turn. Kissing the stone is not for those with fear of heights as you have to hang (with assistance) upside down and backward at the top of the tower. My kids 1, 3, 4 enjoyed their time with forests,",
          "The Blarney Castle offered more than just the Castle. The grounds had a beautiful light hike around the woods in the area where the offered a lot of superstitious stories related to the caves and stones in the area. Everything from witches to wishes you can find right here.",
          "I don't know about aquiring the gift of gab but you definitely will aquire a sense of awe when you visit. The walk from the entrance to the castle is fairly long walk. The gardens are abloom with many plants and flowers. Once you get to the castle you will realize that the climb",

          "The grounds of the castle are beautiful and worth a visit on their own. The castle is wonderfully historic and the climb to the top to kiss the stone is worth the effort. One of our party suffers badly from vertigo and could not even manage to walk around the area where the",

          "You absolutely must visit Blarney Castle and see the famous Stone during your visit to Cork. Buy tickets on the internet to save a euro, and arrive first thing in the morning before the tour buses flood the place. Certainly plan enough time to explore the grounds; enchanting :)",
          "Despite the ongoing drizzle, Blarney Castle and the Blarney Stone was one of the most memorable places we stopped in Ireland. The grounds are gorgeous, the castle interesting (though if you're a large person you may have trouble - some of the passageways are very narrow).",

          "We loved this day trip from our cruise ship. Although they warn you about the steps, I'm quite large and out of shape but had no trouble getting to the top. The views and grounds are worth the trip alone. I'm really sorry we didn't get to tour the house also.",

          "Just do it. It was fun and there is someone there to hang onto you when you lean on out over nothing to kiss the stone. The grounds and manor house nearby are worth the time to walk to even in the rain like we did. The Blarney Woolen Mill store nearby is huge making the whole",

          "A great day out for the family. The grounds surrounding the castle were beautiful. The climb up and down was a bit steep but manageable even with the kids 10, 8 & 6. Kissing the stone was something else, on your back, upside down with a guy hanging onto your waist, brilliant.",

        "wiki": "The Fitzgibbon Cup (Irish: Corn Mhic Giob\u00fain) is the trophy for the premier hurling championship among higher education institutions (universities, colleges and institutes of technology) in Ireland.\nThe Fitzgibbon Cup competition is administered by Comhairle Ard Oideachais Cumann L\u00fathchleas Gael (CLG), the GAA's Higher Education Council. Comhairle Ard Oideachais also oversees the Ryan Cup (tier 2 hurling championship), the Fergal Maher Cup (tier 3 hurling championship) and the Padraig MacDiarmada (tier 4 hurling championship).\nThe GAA Higher Education Cups are sponsored by Electric Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe cup is named after Dr. Edwin Fitzgibbon, a Capuchin friar and, from 1911 to 1936, who was Professor of Philosophy at University College Cork. In 1912 Dr. Fitzgibbon donated most of his annual salary to purchase the trophy. The cup was made at William Egan and Sons' silversmiths, Cork, and bears a large inscription on its front: The Fitzgibbon Cup, Donated by The Rev Fr Edwin O.S.F.C. Feb. 1912. It was a 24-inch-tall, large silver trophy, with a round base and a stem that narrowed and then expanded again in support of a wide spherical body, with Old Celtic tracing designs featuring around the edges. It had a circular, open head, on which was placed a detachable lid. The lid was lost on the night of the 1973 tournament final at Galway and has never been replaced.The competition was played on a round-robin basis until 1949, when a straight knockout format was adopted. For the first 30 years, the cup was dominated by UCC and UCD, with UCG winning occasionally. Queens University Belfast first took part in 1946, and won their only title in 1953. Each of the NUI Colleges had the cup withheld from them once: In 1933 UCC was awarded custody of the cup, but was not declared the formal winner, following a successful objection to three players on the UCD winning team; in 1940 the Cup was not awarded to any team, after UCC, which had won both its games, was deemed to have an irregular team; and in 1954 the cup was withheld from UCG and the tournament declared null and void after an investigation into the legality of the Galway team and violent scenes at the tournament.\nThe popularity of the championship grew, and, in the 60s and 70s three more colleges entered: Trinity College Dublin, UU Coleraine and NUI Maynooth. The eight-in-a-row sequence of victories recorded by UCC from 1981 to 1988 was the greatest in the history of the competition. In the late 1980s, all teams in Division One of the Higher Education League were admitted. In 1989 NIHE Limerick (now University of Limerick) became the first non-university Fitzgibbon Cup champions. Since 2001/02 Institutes of Technology have become top guns in the tournament. Waterford IT won the title four times and Limerick IT, the Cup twice in six years (2002/03 through 2007/08). In the remaining six years Cork IT, Limerick IT and Waterford IT have each been losing finalists twice.

The final in 2012 was a Cork local derby between Cork IT and UCC. The first Fitzgibbon final between Institutes of Technology, also a Munster derby match, took place in 2008 between Waterford IT and Limerick IT.The Fitzgibbon Cup final was played in Limerick in 2014/15, hosted by Limerick Institute of Technology. The final, which brought together the University of Limerick and the 2014 champions Waterford Institute of Technology ended in a 3-13 to 0-21 draw at the Gaelic Grounds. In the replay at P\u00e1irc \u00dai Rinn in Cork, the University of Limerick emerged victorious, winning the Fitzgibbon Cup for the 5th time which UL last won in 2011.\n\n\n== Fitzgibbon Cup 2018-19 ==\n\n\n=== 2018-19 Group A Qualifying ===\nQualifiers: University College Cork; NUI Galway\n\n\n=== 2018-19 Group B Qualifying ===\nQualifiers: Limerick IT, IT Carlow\n\n\n=== 2018-19 Group C Qualifying ===\nQualifiers: DCU D\u00f3chas \u00c9ireann;  Cork Institute of Technology\n\n\n=== 2018-19 Group D Qualifying ===\nQualifiers: Mary Immaculate College Limerick, Dublin Institute of Technology\n\n\n=== 2018-19 Finals Tournament ===\n\n\n== Roll of honour ==\n\n\n=== Colleges by wins ===\nTwo Fitzgibbon Cups tournament were not played (1920/21 and 1942/43), one tournament was declared null and void (1953/54), and in 1932/33 and 1939/40 the Cup and winners' medals were not awarded.\n\nFinalists who have not won the Fitzgibbon Cup:\n\nCork Institute of Technology\nGarda S\u00edoch\u00e1na College\nInstitute of Technology Carlow\nDCU D\u00f3chas \u00c9ireann\n\n\n=== Fitzgibbon Cup Champion Colleges ===\n\n\n=== Fitzgibbon Shield [Plate] winners ===\nThe Fitzgibbon Shield [Plate] competition was introduced in 1976/77 for the teams beaten in the quarter-finals of the Fitzgibbon Cup.

        "wiki": "The Cathedral Church of St Colman, usually known as Cobh Cathedral, sometimes as Queenstown Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Cobh, Ireland. It is the cathedral church of the Diocese of Cloyne. It overlooks Cork harbour from a prominent position. Construction began in 1868 and was not completed until over half a century later due to increases in costs and revisions of the original plans.\n\n\n== Construction and consecration ==\nThe building of the superstructure began in 1869 but when the contractors had taken the external walls to an average of 12 ft. Bishop Keane advised that he preferred a more elaborate design. Consequently, with the exception of the ground plan, none of the original plans were followed. These extra works increased by many thousands of cubic feet of stone the quantity already provided for and substantially increased the cost. Bishop Keane died in January 1874. His successor, Bishop John McCarthy, took the project almost to completion, but it fell to Bishop Robert Browne to  consecrate the cathedral in 1919.\n\n\n=== Staff ===\nThe architects were Edward Welby Pugin and George Ashlin; construction began in 1868. When Pugin died in 1875, Ashlin took on the services of a Dublin architect, Thomas Aloysius Coleman, to assist him in the completion of the project. The clerk of works was Charles Guilfoyle Doran, who supervised the project until his death in 1909, when the cathedral was within sight of being completed.The cathedral was consecrated on 24 August 1919 by the Right Reverend Robert Browne, Bishop of Cloyne, in the presence of three of Ireland's archbishops Michael Logue, John Harty and Thomas Gilmartin.As is Catholic practice, each year on the anniversary day of the Consecration, candles are lit before the twelve crosses on the nave pillars which mark the places where the walls were  anointed with Sacred Chrism in the course of the 1919 consecration liturgy.\n\n\n== Carillon ==\nThe tower contains a carillon which, with 49 bells, is one of the largest in Europe. An automated system strikes the hour and 15 minute intervals while it also rings the bells in appropriate form for Masses, funerals, weddings and events. The carillon is also played on special occasions and generally every Sunday afternoon by its current carillonneur Adrian Gebruers.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPatrick Thompson, Guide to St. Colman's Cathedral, Cobh, revised edition, Carraig Print, Cork.\nJeremy Williams, A Companion Guide to Architecture in Ireland 1837-1921, Irish Academic Press' 1994.\nPaul Atterbury and Clive Wainwright, Pugin, Yale University Press 1994.\nPaul Atterbury, A.W.N.

        "wiki": "Douglas (Irish: D\u00faglas or D\u00fabhglas, meaning \"dark stream\") is a village and suburb contained within Cork city, Ireland and the name given to the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland and Civil parish in which it is contained. Originally a village, the growth of both the village and the city has meant Douglas has become incorporated into the city over time. The 2017 Mackinnon Report proposed that Douglas and surrounding residential areas be moved to within an extended Cork city boundary, ending the division of Douglas between the city and county administrative areas. This was approved by the Cabinet on 6 June 2018, with Douglas and surrounding areas Rochestown, Grange and Frankfield to move into the city council area following the 2019 local elections. This change occurred on 31 May 2019, ending the divide between the separated halves of Douglas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThere are a number of extant or proposed prehistoric sites in Douglas and the surrounding area, including a shell midden, ringforts, souterrains, and a fulacht fiadh. Further evidence of prehistoric settlement in the area includes the finding of a Bronze Age decorated beaten gold disc in the townland of Castletreasure; although reputed to be related to the ruined castle of the same name, it has actually been dated to 2500-2000 BC.\n\n\n=== Origins (13th-17th century) ===\nDouglas was first mentioned in an inquisition on the lands of Gerald de Prendergast in 1251, and in a 1291 taxation document which records the lands as being an appurtenance of the Church of Bauvier. It is alternately listed as \"Duffelglasse\" and \"Duglasse\" in 1302 and 1306, respectively, as part of the parish of Carrigaline. In the year 1603, it became one of the liberties of Cork City. In 1615, parochial records mention the chapel of Douglas being laid waste, reportedly due to theft of the foundation stones, and in a 1700 entry of the same records it is mentioned that the ruined chapel in question had been the church of the Carrigaline parish for a century prior to the construction of a new church in Carrigaline. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms.\n\n\n=== Linen industry (18th-19th century) ===\nThe area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of the \"Douglas factory\" in 1726, reported in August 1755 to be the property of \"Messrs. Perry, Carleton and Co.\", with 100 looms initially operational. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the Royal Navy, amongst other clients. The industry was established by Huguenot weavers and textile workers, such as the Besnards, who acquired the Mills by 1783 and in 1801 installed the first powered spindles in Ireland, along with skilled workers from Ulster and Scotland. In addition to the mill workers, employees included over 1,000 spinners working from their houses, and hacklers, bleachers and labourers tasked with preparing raw material in Douglas village.\n \nFurther textile mills opened in the nineteenth century, including an additional Besnard-owned scutching mill (Ravensdale, 1806), Lane\u2019s Corn and Hemp Mills (now Douglas Community Park, 1845), O\u2019Brien\u2019s Brothers (St Patrick\u2019s Woollen Mills, 1882), Donnybrook Mills (Wallis & Pollock Flax Mills, 1866; re-opened as Morroghs' Woolen Mills, 1889/1890) and Conroy\u2019s Rope and Twine Mills (now Galway's Lane, 1892). Most of the mills ceased to operate in the early twentieth century, although St. Patrick's Woollen Mills and Donnybrook Mills continued to operate until the 1970s. Some of the houses built for the mill workers are still in existence, including a terrace of houses near the junction of the Grange Road and Donnybrook Hill.Other large businesses of the time included an Osiery beside Conroy's Mills, two large brick manufacturers which straddled the nearby estuary, the Ravensdale Flour Mill, and the Woodville Flour Mill which was situated south of the Rochestown train station and produced sea biscuits and ship bread.Douglas developed as a suburban area throughout the later eighteenth century and the nineteenth century, and was noted for the high concentration of 'big houses'. The popularity of the area among the nobility was such that elevated prices were commanded for the surrounding lands, and as a result, the acreage of the estates was lower than average. The oldest house was believed to have been Ronayne's Court, built in 1627 by Morris Ronayne; although the house was demolished in 1969, the original inscribed fireplace was moved to Blackrock Castle. The nearby Montfieldstown House was reputed to be the inspiration for Havisham House of Dickens' Great Expectations, having been abandoned following a ruined wedding. Bloomfield House was connected to a notorious libel case between the prominent Cork Pike and Beamish families, in which the judge, who ruled in favour of Pike in Pike v Beamish, was given the house upon announcement of the verdict by the mother of the plaintiff. Windsor House was occupied by Lord Bandon, Sir Abraham Sutton and the Kiltegan Fathers, before being redeveloped as the Rochestown Park Hotel. Ballybrack House was occupied by the Lane family, also of Vernon Mount, and is the birthplace of art dealer Sir Hugh Lane. It received frequent visits from Lady Gregory, a close relation of the family. High Court, built in 1720 and later known as Westgrove, was the birthplace of playwright and Abbey director Lennox Robinson. Grange House was home of the Conron family, descended from Sir Christopher Hatton, for over 300 years. Douglas Hall, one of the few remaining examples of a slate-fronted house in Ireland, was home to Rev. Dr. Francis Moylan, Bishop of Cork, who was made a freeman for his rhetorical opposition to the French invasion at Bantry Bay during the 1798 Rebellion. Vernon Mount, which was built for a wealthy merchant family in the late 18th century, was occupied by Sir Henry Browne Hayes, who was sentenced to penal servitude in Botany Bay after attempting to abduct an heiress for forced marriage. Other prominent Big Houses included Ravenscourt House, Old Court, Norwood Court, Ballybrack House, Donnybrook House, Montpelier House, Grange Erin, Castletreasure House, Bellvue House, Tramore House (home of the philanthropic Reeves family), and Maryborough House (now the Maryborough House Hotel, with an earlier late-17th century lodge).Douglas was made a separate Roman Catholic parish sometime before 1768. St. Columba\u2019s (Roman Catholic) church was built in 1814 by the Rev. Thomas Barry, according to local legend using the stones of the ruined castle of Castletreasure. A Douglas \"Chapel of Ease\" to the Church of Ireland parish of Carrigaline was established on 17 September 1786, with the establishment of a full separate parish in February 1875. In 1855, the Protestant population of the parish was reported as having been 310, with 150 children attending the parish school. The 1785 church was rebuilt and reconsecrated on 27 August 1875 as St. Luke\u2019s church, however, following the death of the resident Canon in 1886, as well as the principal architect, the church remained without a spire until 1889, with the church bell and tower clock donated by Mary Reeves of Tramore House, with the stipulation that the clock face towards her front door. Notable parishioners interred at St. Luke's include the poet Richard Alfred Milliken and librarian Richard Caulfield; in addition, a plaque was erected in the memory of art collector Sir Hugh Lane, deceased in the sinking of the Lusitania. The nearby parish of St. Finbar's opened a chapel of ease in Frankfield in 1838, later known as the Holy Trinity, on ground donated by Samuel Lane. An additional graveyard, located on Carr's Hill, was opened in 1848 on land donated by the Master of the Workhouse, George Carr, to deal with the increase in deaths from the Great Famine.In 1898, the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company built a route from Cork City to Douglas. This operated until 1932 when it was replaced by a bus service.\n\n\n=== Later developments (20th-21st century) ===\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Douglas underwent major changes as it became a suburb of Cork. New housing was built and the area between Douglas and Cork City became built-up. Schools, shopping centres and other amenities developed to serve this new population. Douglas Community School was built in 1968, and the original Douglas Shopping Centre was completed in 1972. This shopping centre underwent a significant redevelopment at the turn of the 21st century (although, as of 2020, is closed following a fire). A second shopping centre, Douglas Court Shopping Centre, was built in the late 1980s and a 5-screen multiplex cinema (since demolished) was also built. Several hotels, including the Rochestown Park Hotel and Maryborough House Hotel were also developed. Douglas has two golf facilities, Douglas Golf Club at Maryborough Hill and a driving range at Frankfield Golf Club.Following the release of the MacKinnon Report in 2017, covering a possible extension of Cork city's boundary, it was proposed that the Douglas area (including Douglas, Frankfield, Grange and Donnybrook) would be moved to the administrative area of Cork City Council. This, if implemented, would move all of Douglas to the city, ending the divide of the town between the city and county. The boundary change (incorporating parts of Ballincollig, Douglas, Glanmire, and Rochestown within the city boundary) occurred in late May 2019.\n\n\n== Residential areas ==\n\nFrom the late 19th and into the 20th century, there was an expansion of residential areas in the Douglas catchment. Housing developments (mostly private, with some social housing) were built in Grange, Frankfield, Donnybrook, Maryborough, Rochestown, Mount Oval and along the two main roads connecting Douglas to the city centre, the Douglas Road and the South Douglas Road.Donnybrook, for example, is South of Douglas village, and has a Centra outlet, snooker club, football club (College Corinthians) and forested walkway (at Ballybrack Woods) serve as amenities for the residential developments in the Donnybrook Hill area.Grange and Frankfield (encompassed by Frankfield/Grange parish) lie to the West of Douglas village, and are mainly residential areas served by retail outlets (including SuperValu and Aldi), schools (like Scoil Nioclais primary school) and other services (including an office of Douglas credit union). The residential development at Mount Oval has a bar, Spar, and a pharmacy.\n\n\n== Amenities ==\n\nAmenities and green-spaces in the area include Douglas Community Park (a 5-acre park close to the centre of Douglas which includes a playground), and Ballybrack Woods (a wooded area south of Douglas village which is known locally as 'Mangala').There have been calls to build a pedestrian and cycle trail through the woods around Vernon Mount, carried by an overbridge across the South Ring Road to Tramore Valley Park.\n\n\n== Shopping and business ==\nThe village centre of Douglas has two principal commercial streets, East Douglas Street and West Douglas Street, which are situated approximately 300m apart. Retail activity is also centred around two shopping centres, Douglas Court Shopping Centre and Douglas Village Shopping Centre. \"Douglas Court\" (anchored by Dunnes Stores) was built in the early-1990s, and \"Douglas Village\" (anchored by Tesco, Marks and Spencer and TK Maxx) was originally developed in the mid-1970s and was the second shopping centre ever built in Ireland.Douglas was formerly the site of the headquarters of Cork and Limerick Savings Bank. However, this bank was merged into Trustee Savings Bank in 1992. The former headquarters was initially still used for regional administration, but this function was transferred to a new building in Cork Airport Business Park.A farmers market is held every Saturday morning outside the Douglas Village Shopping Centre entrance.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn the 2011 census, the percentage of Irish nationals living in Douglas was 88.8%. UK nationals accounted for 1.7%; Polish nationals 3.2%; Lithuanians 0.6%; Other EU nationals 2.1%; Other nationals 2.9%; 0.7% did not state their nationality.In the 2016 census, 78.6% of residents of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, 8% were members of other religions, 12% had no religion and less than 1% did not state a religion. In the same census, 86.2% of electoral division residents identified as white Irish, 8.3% were other whites, 1% were black, 1.7% Asian or Asian Irish, 1.4% were of other ethnicities, and 1% did not state an ethnicity.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== GAA ===\n\nGAA clubs in the area include the Douglas GAA and Nemo Rangers hurling and football clubs. Nemo Rangers were historically associated with Turners Cross, but moved to a new location in the Trabeg area of Douglas in the 1990s.\nIn the 2004, 2007 and 2012 u10 Community Games, Douglas won the Cork Community Games, the Munster Community Games and the all-Ireland Community Games.\n\n\n=== Association football ===\nLocal association football (soccer) clubs include Tramore Athletic F.C., Grangevale AFC, College Corinthians and Douglas Hall AFC.\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nThere are also local golf (and pitch and putt) clubs, including Douglas Golf Club, Frankfield Golf Club and Douglas Pitch and Putt Club.\n\n\n=== Rugby union ===\nDouglas has representation in rugby union, and Douglas RFC was founded in 1902 as one of the earliest Cork rugby clubs. While this original club drew members from the workforce of St Patrick's Woollen Mills in Douglas (which closed in the 1970s), the club in its current form was founded in 1979.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nOther sports clubs include tennis (Douglas Tennis Club), basketball (Fr. Mathews Basketball Club), gymnastics (Douglas Gymnastics Club), martial arts (at Elite Fitness Centre), cricket and hockey clubs (Cork Harlequins and Church of Ireland Hockey Club).\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Road ===\nThe N40 passes through Douglas, but it is not possible to turn onto it in an eastbound direction and westbound traffic may not leave the road. Fuller access is available via the N28 from nearby Rochestown.\nDouglas is served by a number of R-standard roads, including the R609 (which links to the N28 at Maryborough), R610 (Passage West to Cork city centre), R851 (Cork city centre to the N27), and R853 (to Ballinlough).\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nBus services are provided by Bus \u00c9ireann, and the routes which pass through Douglas include numbers 206 (Grange to the city centre), 207 (Donnybrook to Ballyvolane), 216 (Mount Oval to Cork University Hospital), 219 (Mahon to Cork Institute of Technology), 220 (Ovens - Grange Manor to Carrigaline and Crosshaven), and 223 (Cork City Centre to Haulbowline).\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThe nearest active railway station is Cork Kent railway station, approximately 5 km away. Until 1932, Douglas was served by the Blackpool-Douglas route of the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company.\n\n\n== Religious congregations ==\n\nAs of the 2016 census, 78.6% of the population of the Douglas electoral division identified as Catholic, with St. Columbas as the first Catholic parish church in the area, dating to 1814. From the 1960s, with housing developments and population growth in Douglas, overcrowding in St. Columbas prompted a decision to build a new Catholic church in the Grange/Frankfield area. This new church (the Church of the Incarnation) was consecrated in 1976, and was a chapel-of-ease to the Douglas parish before being separating into its own parish in 1982. St. Patrick's Catholic church serves the Rochestown area, and dates to 1991.Other religious congregations serving the Douglas population include St. Lukes (Anglican) church which was consecrated in 1875, the Wesley Chapel (Methodist) church on the Douglas Road, Douglas Baptist congregation (which meets at Douglas Community School), Radical Life (Pentecostal) church, the Holy Trinity (Anglican) church in Frankfield which dates to 1838, and the Inspiration House (RCCG) in Frankfield.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJohn Dunlay, recipient of the Victoria Cross\nJack Gleeson, film and stage actor\nGerald Goldberg, first Jewish Lord Mayor of Cork\nRob Heffernan, Irish Olympian\nCillian Murphy, film and stage actor\nBilly O'Callaghan, Irish short story writer\nDonncha O'Callaghan, professional Rugby union player\nRonan O'Gara, professional rugby player\nLennox Robinson, dramatist, poet and director of the Abbey Theatre\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nPrimary Education:\n\nEglantine \u2013 Catholic girls school\nScoil An Athar Tadhg \u00d3 Murch\u00fa \u2013 Irish language mixed-sex school\nSt. Luke's \u2013 Church of Ireland mixed-sex school\nScoil Nioclais \u2013 Catholic mixed-sex school\nSt. Columba's BNS \u2013 Catholic boys school\nSt. Columba's GNS \u2013 Catholic girls school\nRochestown Educate Together National School (Educate Together mixed-sex school)Secondary:\n\nDouglas Community School \u2013 boys school\nRegina Mundi College \u2013 girls school\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of towns and villages in Ireland\nMetropolitan Cork\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

          "Food is good, but I feel they should really improve with the way they manage the orders for each table as every time I go they don't know at which table we were sitting and what did I order. \nAt least put numbers on the tables as even when I explain where I sat, it's like I'm talking in another language.

        "wiki": "Barryscourt Castle (Caisle\u00e1n Ch\u00fairt an Bharraigh in Irish) is a castle located in eastern County Cork in southern Ireland, close to the town of Carrigtwohill.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site on which Barryscourt castle now stands has been occupied for over a thousand years- there is evidence of a wooden watermill having been built next to a stream at the site sometime in the 7th century, long before any fortification existed there. Barryscourt fell into the hands of the Anglo-Norman de Barry family in the 12th century, and masonry from this period found at the site may be the remains of another watermill or possibly an early fortification built by the Barrys.\nWhile the de Barry's lands in various parts of County Cork were divided amongst various branches of the family, Barryscourt remained in the possession of the most powerful branch, the Barrymores (Barra m\u00f3r or \"Great Barry\" in Irish). The Barrymore line later became extinct, Barryscourt thus passing to a distant cousin, James FitzRichard of the Barryroes  (Barra rua, \"Red Barry\"), in 1556. The present Tower house at Barryscourt was probably built late in the reign of the Barrymores, either in the 15th or 16th century, with a tentative date of about 1550 based on the architectural style, and became the family seat of the Barrys.\nThe Barrys supported the Desmond Rebellions of 1569 and 1579, and in 1581 they destroyed or severely damaged the family castles to prevent English forces from capturing them, including Barryscourt, which was threatened by an army led by Sir Walter Raleigh. After the suppression of the second rebellion, the Barrys were pardoned by Queen Elizabeth I and Barryscourt was repaired, with an outer wall or \"bawn\" surrounding an inner courtyard being added, including 3 corner towers.\nBarryscourt ceased to be main residence of the Barry family in 1617, but was evidently still an important fortification for many years afterwards, as it was attacked and captured in 1645, during the Irish Confederate War. The marks caused by the impact of cannonballs during this attack can still be seen on the castle walls.\nBarryscourt castle eventually fell into disuse, and a house was built by the Coppinger family (who had taken over the property from the Barrys) next to the castle in the early 18th century; this house has long since disappeared. The Barryscourt Trust was set up in 1987 for the purpose of conserving and developing the potential of the castle as a heritage site. In the 1990s, the relatively intact shell of the tower house was repaired and reroofed by D\u00fachas, and is now a popular tourist heritage site run by the Office of Public Works. The interior is furnished as it would have been in the 16th century. The castle has daily guided tours available free of charge.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nBarryscourt castle was built in a style fairly typical in Ireland in the 16th century, consisting of a main tower house building with smaller adjacent buildings arranged around a courtyard, which was protected by an outer \"bawn\" or curtain wall, with 3 smaller corner towers.\nA large building once stood next to the main tower inside the bawn, and was probably a dining hall, but only ruins remain. The main tower is situated at the south-west corner of the roughly rectangular curtain wall and the main entrance to the courtyard is right next to it, set into the south curtain wall (there is also a smaller gate in the north curtain wall). The dungeon is a drop-prisoner-in-from-the-top type.\nThree smaller turrets project from the north-east, south-east and south-west corners of the main tower. These three turrets are 5 storeys high, while the main block of the tower is only 3 storeys high.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\nMedieval Ireland: The Barryscourt Lectures I-X.

There are also ecumenical or para-church programmes that are explicitly outreaches to LGBT people, but do not identify with any particular faith tradition or denomination.\n\n\n== History ==\nToday some Christian denominations are accepting of homosexuality and transgender identity and inclusive of homosexual and transgender people, such as the United Church of Christ and the Metropolitan Community Church. Formed in 1991, The Evangelical Network is a network of evangelical churches, ministries and Christian Workers that are a part of the LGBT community. The Evangelical Network holds an annual conference and provides education, ministerial support, and networking capabilities.In 1946, Archbishop George Hyde of the Eucharistic Catholic Communion (a small denomination not in union with the Roman Catholic Church) celebrated mass for gay men in Atlanta. In 1956, the Church of ONE Brotherhood was founded in Los Angeles by a gay-rights activist. In 1962, a Congregationalist pastor began an overt pastoral ministry to gay people in New York City.  The first gay and transgender-specific denomination, as opposed to individual congregations, was the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches in 1968.Some congregations are merely non-discriminatory and LGBT-affirming while others are specifically oriented toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons. Some local congregations, especially those designated as \"Welcoming churches\" in the Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, Methodist, Episcopal, and Brethren/Mennonite denominations, may consist of a majority of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender members.While Unitarian Universalism is no longer explicitly a Christian religion, it does have Judeo-Christian roots. Both the Unitarian Universalist Association and the Canadian Unitarian Council have officially affirmed LGBT people and have openly advocated for gay rights.\n\n\n== Denominations ==\n\n\n=== Africa and Asia ===\nAglipayan Church - officially known as Philippine Independent Church or Iglesia Filipina Independiente. The church has adopted an official and binding position of inclusion and full acceptance of LGBT individuals and organizations since 2017 after the question of inclusiveness was raised in an official leadership meeting by a gay member of the church in 2014. Its youth organization wing has also repeatedly elected presidents, vice presidents, and executives who belong to the Filipino LGBT youth sector.\nAnglican Church of Korea NOTE: The Anglican church has some clergy and congregations that support LGBT rights.\nAnglican Church of Southern Africa NOTE: The Anglican church defines marriage as between a man and a woman, but does allow for the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy. Bishop Mervyn Castle of False Bay was openly gay and celibate. Also, for lay people, \"Anglican bishops from across southern Africa have resolved that gay and lesbian partners who enter same-sex civil unions under South African law should be welcomed into congregations as full members of the church.\" The Diocese of Saldanha Bay has proposed the blessing of same-sex unions with the bishop's support.\nChurch of South India NOTE: The CSI opened ordination to transgender persons, has ministries specifically for transgender rights and some clergy support gay rights. The CSI is among the Anglican churches that \"are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow for same-sex unions\" according to the BBC.\nEvangelical Church of India\nMembers Church of God International (Known as Ang Dating Daan as their Presiding Minister Bro. Eliseo Soriano is a Prominent Member of LGBT)\nUnited Church of Christ in Japan\nUnited Church of Christ in the Philippines\nUniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa (Southern Synod)\nDutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) NOTE: Each congregation may determine its own decision on gay marriage and gay ministers.  However, in November 2016 the Extraordinary Synod formally defined marriage as \"a commitment between one man and one woman\" and gay sex as a sin. Congregations are allowed to deny employment to married gays, but also allowed to define their own position. However, on 8 March 2019 a Pretoria high court judgment overturned the Dutch Reformed Church's decision not to recognise same-sex unions within the church. The Church decided not to appeal the decision.  [1][96]\nMethodist Church of Southern Africa NOTE: The church \"accepts same-sex relationships (as long as such relationships are not...marriage)\".\nUniting Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa NOTE: Each minister may exercise his or her conscience and support same-sex unions\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\n\n==== Anglican ====\n\nEpiscopal Church (United States)\nEvangelical Anglican Church In America\n\n\n==== Baptist ====\nAlliance of Baptists\nAssociation of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists\nCooperative Baptist Fellowship NOTE: Each congregation determines its own position\n\n\n==== Catholic ====\nAmerican National Catholic Church\nEcumenical Catholic Church\nEcumenical Catholic Communion\nEvangelical Catholic Church\nOld Catholic Church\nTraditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church\n\n\n==== Lutheran ====\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in America: the ELCA's document A Social Statement on Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust  notes \"While Lutherans hold various convictions regarding lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships, this church is united on many critical issues. It opposes all forms of verbal or physical harassment and assault based on sexual orientation. It supports legislation and policies to protect civil rights and to prohibit discrimination in housing, employment, and public services. It has called upon congregations and members to welcome, care for, and support same-gender couples and their families and to advocate for their legal protection.\"\nEvangelical Lutheran Church in Canada\n\n\n==== Methodist ====\nUnited Methodist Church's General Conference, voted forward a conservative \"Traditional plan\", defeating the more liberal \"One Church plan.\" No discretion is allowed to ordain gay, lesbian, or bisexual clergy in same-gender relationships, or marry gay couples. There is no prohibition on the ordination of transgender clergy and the Judicial Council ruled, in 2007, that transgender clergy can remain ordained. The United Methodist News Service reiterated that there is no rule against transgender clergy. The vote on the \"Traditional Plan\" was 53 percent in favor to 47 opposed. The Judicial Council reviewed the plan and upheld 10 petitions while declaring 7 petitions, approximately 40 percent of the plan, unconstitutional. UMC's Book of Discipline  Article 4. [Inclusiveness of the Church] includes this statement: \"All persons without regard to race, color, national origin, status, or economic condition, shall be eligible to attend its worship services... \" and later, within part 304.4: \"The practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching. Therefore self-avowed practicing homosexuals are not to be certified as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church.\" Previously, Annual Conferences had affirmed LGBT clergy and relationships through resolutions. The South Carolina Annual Conference had passed a resolution supporting transgender rights. The Western Jurisdiction elected the denomination's first openly and partnered lesbian bishop in 2016. The North Central Jurisdiction considered an openly gay nominee for bishop although not elected. Additionally, the Northeastern Jurisdiction passed a resolution supporting the option of allowing same-sex marriages. On May 7, 2018 the Council of Bishops in the United Methodist Church, had proposed allowing individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings, which came to be known as the One Church plan.  Their proposal was rejected by the February 26, 2019 General Conference vote. The highest level of the United Methodist Church will now strengthen punishments for 1) pastors who are non-celibate gay people, or 2) pastors who perform same-sex weddings. Nevertheless, the Western Jurisdiction, the German Central Conference, and other annual conferences within other jurisdictions have announced that they will not enforce the Traditional Plan and some of these have continued to ordain LGBTQ clergy.\nUnited Church of Canada shares both the rich heritage of Methodist and Reform traditions.  In 1925, Canadian Methodist Church, Canada, Congregationalists and some churches of the Presbyterian Church in Canada united to form the United Church of Canada.  Within the United Church of Canada, congregations decide if they are Affirming or if they perform same sex marriages. Over 150 United Church congregations are either Affirming or are in the process of becoming Affirming congregations.\n\n\n==== Pentecostal ====\nAffirming Pentecostal Church International\nGlobal Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals\n\n\n==== Reformed ====\nChristian Church (Disciples of Christ)\nReformed Church in America NOTE: Gay pastors may serve congregations if they were ordained in another denomination; some member churches allow gay marriage.\nPresbyterian Church (USA)\nUnited Church of Christ\nUnited Church of Canada Each individual congregation decides for itself whether or not to be Affirming or to solemnize same sex marriages. Over 150 United Church congregations are either Affirming or are in the process of becoming Affirming congregations.

In 2016, the Bishop of Grantham came out as the first openly gay bishop in a relationship. The C of E voted to affirm transgender people. The church approved services to celebrate and mark a person's gender transition.\nChurch in Wales NOTE: A majority supports same-sex marriage; the church said LGBT people can be \u201chonest and open, respected and affirmed\u201d. The church also permits gay priests to enter into civil partnerships. The church voted to explore approving same-sex marriages and blessings for civil partnerships.\nChurch of Ireland congregations in Northern Ireland may be affirming NOTE: the denomination remains in conversation as a whole; in 2011, a senior cleric entered into a same-sex civil partnership and kept his post.\nScottish Episcopal Church.\nChurch of Scotland NOTE: The Church of Scotland voted to permit pastors to enter into same-sex marriages\nThe Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)  NOTE: Not all Quakers view themselves as Christian; they are however an historically Christian religious group.\nInternational Council of Community Churches\nMethodist Church of Great Britain NOTE: The church may bless civil same-sex marriages\nUnitarian and Free Christian Churches\nUnited Ecumenical Catholic Church\nUnited Reformed Church\nAffirming Pentecostal Church International (Wales)\n\n\n=== Latin America ===\nArgentina - Evangelical Church of the River Plate\nArgentina - United Evangelical Lutheran Church\nArgentina - Evangelical Methodist Church in Argentina\nBrazil - Affirming Pentecostal Church International\nBrazil - Christian Community of God (Authenticists)\nBrazil - Catholic Diversity\nBrazil - Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil (since 1998)\nBrazil - Evangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil\nBrazil - United Presbiterian Church\nChile - Evangelical Lutheran Church of Chile\nChile - Lutheran Church in Chile\nColombia - Affirming Pentecostal Church International\nColombia - Methodist Church of Colombia Openly LGBTQ+ pastors may serve in churches and also same saxe/same gender weddings can be celebrated.\nCosta Rica - Costa Rican Lutheran Church\nCosta Rica - Episcopal Church of Costa Rica\nCuba - Episcopal Church of Cuba\nEl Salvador - Episcopal Anglican Church of El Salvador\nPeru - Lutheran Church of Peru\nUruguay - Evangelical Church of Uruguay\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAffirming congregations within the Anglican Church of Australia NOTE: The Diocese of Perth, and other bodies, have voted to support same-sex relationships The Diocese of Gippsland appointed an openly and partnered gay priest. Though the Anglican Church of Australia does not have an official policy on homosexuality, in the Seventeenth Session of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Australia in 2017, the Anglican Church of Australia passed a motion recognising \"that the doctrine of our church, in line with traditional Christian teaching, is that marriage is an exclusive and lifelong union of a man and a woman, and further, recognises that this has been the subject of several General Synod resolutions over the past fifteen years\". In 2018, the Primate of Australia and Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, released an ad clerum reiterating the current position that clergy cannot perform a same-sex marriage.\nUniting Church in Australia\nUnited Ecumenical Catholic Church in Australia\nMetropolitan Community Church\nReligious Society of Friends (Quakers)\nBaptist Church of Australia - some Baptist congregations in Australia\nUniversal Church of Love, Peace & Equality Inc \n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nAnglican Church in New Zealand NOTE: As of 2018, clergy may bless a same-sex union.

        "wiki": "Saints Peter and Paul's Church is a Catholic church located just off St Patrick's Street in Cork City, Ireland.\n\n\n== History ==\nPeter and Paul's was built to replace Carey's Lane Chapel, a much smaller structure built in 1786. Under the guidance of Archdeacon John Murphy, a design competition was run in the 1850s and won by E. W. Pugin, son of Augustus Pugin. The foundation stone was laid on 15 August 1859 and the church was dedicated for worship on 29 June 1866.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe church comprises a central nave with gable roof and two aisles. The walls are of red sandstone with limestone dressing. The aisles are at either side of the nave, which is covered with a gable roof. The ridge of the roof is decorated by ornamental ironwork, partly gilt, terminated at the western gable by an ornamental cross with foliated arms.\nThe grand altar is carved from 36 tons of Carrara marble. The pavements surrounding the altar, and the steps, are all of white Italian vein marble. The apse is decorated with blue and gold ceiling panels. The flooring of the church is in white and black marble.\nThe pulpit and confessionals were carved from Russian oak by craftsmen from Leuven and Cork.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nImage gallery\nSaints Peter and Paul's Church, Cork on Twitter \nFacebook page",

        "wiki": "Cillian Murphy (; born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor and musician. He began his career performing as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he began his acting career in theater, and in short and independent films in the late 1990s. His first notable roles were in films such as 28 Days Later (2002), Cold Mountain (2003), Intermission (2003), Red Eye (2005) and Breakfast on Pluto (2005), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and won an Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor. Murphy played the character of Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012). In the mid-late 2000s, he starred in films such as The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), Sunshine (2007), The Edge of Love (2008), Inception (2010), and Peacock (2010).\nIn 2011, Murphy won the Irish Times Theatre Award for Best Actor and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for Misterman. He also became patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan, Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In the early 2010s, he appeared in the films In Time (2011), Retreat (2011), and Red Lights (2012). Murphy is married to Irish visual artist Yvonne McGuinness. The two first met in 1996, and they got married in 2004. McGuinness works in video installation and print and has also made several short films.\nSince 2013, Murphy has portrayed Thomas Shelby, the lead of the BBC gangster series Peaky Blinders, for which he has won two Irish Film and Television Awards for Best Actor \u2013 Drama, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2020, he was listed at number 12 on The Irish Times list of Ireland's greatest film actors. He appeared in the films Transcendence (2014), In the Heart of the Sea (2015), Anthropoid (2016), Dunkirk (2017), Delinquent Season (2018), and Anna (2019). In 2020, he has a role in the sequel A Quiet Place Part II.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMurphy was born in Douglas, County Cork, Ireland, and was raised in Ballintemple, Cork. His father Brendan worked for the Irish Department of Education, and his mother was a French teacher. His grandfather, aunts and uncles were also teachers. Murphy started playing music and writing songs at the age of 10. He has a younger brother, P\u00e1idi Murphy, and two younger sisters, Sile Murphy and Orla Murphy.He was raised Roman Catholic, and attended the Catholic secondary school Presentation Brothers College; there he did well academically but got into trouble often, sometimes being suspended, until he decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth the hassle. Not keen on sports, a major part of the school's life, Murphy found that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school. However, it was in secondary school that he got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, the director of the Corcadorca Theatre Company; Murphy later described the experience as a \"huge high\" and a \"fully alive\" feeling that he set out to chase. His English teacher, the poet and novelist William Wall, encouraged him to pursue acting; however, to Murphy, performing meant becoming a rock star.In his late teens and early twenties, Murphy pursued a career as a musician, singing and playing guitar in several bands alongside his brother, P\u00e1idi; the Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band 'The Sons of Mr. Greengenes', after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa, which he said \"specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos\". They were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but did not sign the contract; this was owing to P\u00e1idi still being in secondary school, and to the small recompense involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy later confessed: \"I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music.\"He began studying law at University College Cork (UCC) in 1996, but he failed his first-year exams because, as he put it, he had \"no ambitions to do it\". Not only was he busy with his band, but he has said that he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of A Clockwork Orange, directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, which also starred Irish-American comedian Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1996\u20132001: Early work ===\nMurphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: \"There was something about him \u2013 he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, \"My God\". It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time.\" Murphy observed, \"I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose.\" Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.He starred in many other theatre productions, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing (1998), The Country Boy (1999) and Juno and the Paycock (also 1999). He began appearing in independent films such as On the Edge (2001), and in short films, including Filleann an Feall (2000) and Watchmen (2001). He also reprised his role for the film adaption of Disco Pigs (2001) and appeared in the BBC television mini-series adaptation of The Way We Live Now.During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first to Dublin for a few years, then to London in 2001.\n\n\n=== 2002\u20132004: Move to Hollywood ===\nIn 2002, Murphy starred as Adam in a theatre production of Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things at the Gate Theatre in Dublin.\nHe was cast in the lead role in Danny Boyle's horror film 28 Days Later (2002). He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is \"perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world\" after waking from a coma in a London hospital. Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs. Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film. She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a \"dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film.\" Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in North America and a major success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time. His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. Murphy professed that he considered the film to be much deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film's success and that American audiences responded well to its content and violence. About the film, Murphy said \"\u201cthe film did so well. And you watch zombie stuff [now], we were the first people to make zombies run, and [that] changed everything. It has a very special place in my heart, that movie.\u201dIn 2003, he played the role of Konstantine in a stage production of Chekhov's The Seagull at the Edinburgh International Festival.\nHe starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission (2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until The Wind That Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the \"sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker\" in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphy brought \"fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres\". He had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain (2003). He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a \"massive production\", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003) with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.In 2004, he toured Ireland with the Druid Theatre Company, in The Playboy of the Western World (playing the character of Christy Mahon) under the direction of Garry Hynes\u2014who had previously directed Murphy back in 1999 in the theatre productions of Juno and the Paycock\u2014and also in The Country Boy.\n\n\n=== 2005\u20132006: Critical success ===\nMurphy starred as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005). Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan. Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow. Nolan told Spin, \"He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups.\" Murphy reprised the role of Scarecrow as in The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).\nHe starred as Jackson Rippner, who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye (2005). New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made \"a picture-perfect villain\" and that his \"baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors.\" The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.Murphy received several awards nominations for his 2005 bad guy turns, among them a nomination as Best Villain at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for Batman Begins. Entertainment Weekly ranked him among its 2005 \"Summer MVPs\", a cover story list of 10 entertainers with outstanding breakthrough performances. The New Yorker's David Denby wrote: \"Cillian Murphy, who has angelic looks that can turn sinister, is one of the most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies.\"\n\nMurphy starred as Patrick/\"Kitten\" Braden, a transgender Irish woman in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan's comedy-drama Breakfast on Pluto (2005), based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film's kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red-light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high drag blond bombshell. He had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of The Crying Game was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites. The role required \"serious primping\" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal, and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character with a \"bemused and hopeful voice\". While even lukewarm reviews of Breakfast on Pluto still tended to praise Murphy's performance highly, a few critics dissented: The Village Voice, which panned the film, found him \"unconvincing\" and overly cute.\nMurphy was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Breakfast on Pluto and won the fourth Irish Film and Television Academy Best Actor Award. Premiere cited his performance as Kitten in their \"The 24 Finest Performances of 2005\" feature.Murphy starred in The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), a film about the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the most successful Irish independent film at the Irish box office. Murphy was especially keen on appearing in the film due to his intimate connections to Cork, Ireland, where the film was shot. Murphy had to audition six times for the role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphy considered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was \"tremendously proud\" of the film, remarking that the \"memories run very, very deep \u2013 the politics, the divisions and everybody has stories of family members who were caught up in the struggle.\" Critic Denby noted Murphy's moments of deep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showing us a man who is eaten up alive because he's forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and his training.\" GQ UK presented Murphy with its 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in The Wind That Shakes the Barley.\n\n\n=== 2006\u20132010: Mainstream career ===\nMurphy returned to the stage opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play Love Song. Theatre Record described his character of Beane as a \"winsomely cranky\" mentally unstable \"sentimentalised lonely hero\", noting how he magnetically, with \"all blue eyes and twitching hands\", moves \"comically from painfully shy \"wallpaper\" to garrulous, amorous male.\" Variety considered his performance to be \"as magnetic onstage as onscreen\", remarking that his \"unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink\".He starred in the science fiction film Sunshine (2007) as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun, which teamed him up again with director Danny Boyle. He starred opposite Lucy Liu in Paul Soter's romantic comedy Watching the Detectives (2007); the indie film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and was then released straight to DVD. Murphy had starred as Richard Neville, editor of the psychedelic radical underground magazine Oz in the film Hippie Hippie Shake, which was shot in 2007, but the project, much delayed, was eventually shelved in 2011.Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008), the sequel to Batman Begins, before starring in The Edge of Love\u2014about a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomas\u2014with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. Murphy also made a debut appearance in another medium\u2014on a postage stamp: in July 2008, the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from The Wind That Shakes the Barley. In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in The Water, directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silent movie, which he considered to be the \"hardest test for any actor\". Murphy also starred in Perrier's Bounty, a crime dramedy from the makers of Intermission, in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.\n\nIn 2010, he also made a return to theatre in From Galway to Broadway and back again, which was a stage show that celebrated the Druid Theatre Company's 35th birthday.The direct-to-video psychological thriller Peacock (2010), co-starring Ellen Page, Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, starred Murphy as a man with a split personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of The Washington Times referred to the film as \"a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn by Cillian Murphy\", and noted that although Murphy wasn't a stranger to playing in drag, his work in the film set a \"new standard for gender-bending performances\".Murphy next starred in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio's character Cobb to convince him to dissolve his business. That year, Murphy also made an uncredited cameo appearance as programmer Edward Dillinger Jr., son of original Tron antagonist Ed Dillinger (David Warner) in Tron: Legacy.\n\n\n=== 2011\u2013present: Peaky Blinders ===\nIn 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama Misterman, written and directed by Enda Walsh, whom Murphy previously worked with on Disco Pigs. The production was initially put on in Galway and\nwas then taken to St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Murphy commented of the role, \"The live nature of it makes it so dangerous. You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show\". His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award. Sarak Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a \"complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all \u2013 deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code\", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's \"unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show Misterman\", and documented that on one evening the \"theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence\", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance. He played the lead in the British horror film Retreat (2011), which had a limited release. He also appeared in the science fiction film In Time (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed.\n\nMurphy starred in Red Lights (2012) with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character who is a paranormal investigator. Murphy considered working with De Niro to have been one of the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: \"My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a camera on it, it just becomes something else.\"\nThe film was panned by critics and did not make its budget back at the box office. Murphy then went on to reprise his role as the Scarecrow for the third time in The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and had a supporting role as Mike, the favourite teacher of the main character Skunk, in the British independent film Broken (2012). His performance earned him a British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.Since 2013, Murphy has played the lead role in the BBC television series Peaky Blinders, a series about a criminal gang in post-First World War Birmingham. He explained his enthusiasm for the show in an interview with The Independent: \"[the scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'\" Peaky Blinders was critically praised and a ratings success. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. On August 25, the first episode of season 5 was broadcast on BBC One. In an interview with digitalspy.com,  Anthony Byrne, director of the series, said that \"if we did start shooting in January (2021), we wouldn't finish until May or June and then it's another 6 months of editing.\" This would place the release date for Peaky Blinders season 6 at the end of 2021, or the beginning of 2022. Also in 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for the band Money's single Hold Me Forever. The video features dancers from the English National Ballet and was filmed at The Old Vic Theatre in London.In 2014, he co-starred in the film Aloft, with Jennifer Connelly, and Wally Pfister's Transcendence, which also starred Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall. Murphy also reunited with Enda Walsh for the play Ballyturk in 2014. He starred in Ron Howard's 2015 film, In the Heart of the Sea, which also features Benjamin Walker and Chris Hemsworth. Cillian contributed spoken vocals to the tracks \"8:58\" and \"The Clock\" from Paul Hartnoll's album 8:58 (2015). The two previously met while Hartnoll was scoring the second season of Peaky Blinders. Murphy portrayed Czechoslovak World War II army soldier Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk, who was involved in Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Anthropoid (2016).Murphy played a shell-shocked army officer who is recovered from a wrecked ship in Christopher Nolan's war film, Dunkirk (2017). Murphy felt his character, who is nameless and was credited simply as \"Shivering Soldier\", was \"representative of something experienced by thousands of soldiers, which is the profound emotional and psychological toll that war can have\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Family ===\nIn mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, whom he had met in 1996 at one of his rock band's shows. The couple live in Dublin (where they moved back in 2015 after previously living for 14 years in London) and have two sons, Malachy, born in December 2005, and Aran, born in July 2007.\n\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\nMusic is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, \"The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs.\" He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own, and still writes songs. Murphy does not plan to start another band, and said, \"Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously.\"He was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices. He began eating meat again for his role in Peaky Blinders. He is a dedicated runner.He often works in or near the city, and has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood. He prefers not to speak about his personal life, and did not appear on any live TV chat shows until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RT\u00c9 to promote Perrier's Bounty, yet still remained reserved. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience \"a challenge... and not one I want to overcome\". He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: \"I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk\". In 2005, Murphy stated he was friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a \"surrogate movie dad\". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.In 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed men.\n\n\n=== Religious beliefs and social causes ===\nRegarding religion, Murphy had previously been verging on agnostic, but confirmed his atheism after researching his role as a nuclear physicist/astronaut in the science fiction film Sunshine (2007).His political activity includes participating in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election, and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organisation Focus Ireland. In 2011, he became a patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for \"highlighting [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCillian Murphy on IMDb",

        "wiki": "Mallow Castle is a National Monument situated off the N72 on Bridewell Lane, Mallow, County Cork, Ireland.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 33-acre (13 ha) site is composed gardens and parkland on which three buildings sit: the remains of a 16th-century fortified house, a 19th-century mansion to the north, and the ruins of a 13th-century castle to the east. The fortified house is a long rectangular three-storey building, with two polygonal towers on the north-west and south-west corners. It is early Jacobean in style, featuring high gables, stepped battlements, and mullioned windows. The wings of the house project from the centre of the south and north walls, with the entrance in the north wing. The design of the house was to provide a field of fire around it entirely.The 19th-century baronial mansion has parts which date to the 1690s and is situated near the older ruined Mallow Castle. As a refurbished building it features 8 reception rooms, which include a music room, a billiard room and a library, as well as 12 bedrooms.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first castle in Mallow was built on the instructions of King John in 1185. In 1282, it came into the possession of the Earls of Desmond. Following the Geraldine Wars, the estate was confiscated by Elizabeth I, who granted it to Sir Thomas Norrey along with the Lordship of Mallow and 6,000 acres (2,400 ha) of surrounding country. The Desmond Castle, as it was known, fell into such bad repair that in 1585 a new castle was constructed on the same site.The fortified house dates from the 16th century and is believed to have been built by Sir Thomas Norreys, Lord President of Munster, who died in 1599. Following his death, his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Sir John Jephson inherited the house, with their family remaining in Mallow for almost 400 years. It was placed under siege by Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount  Mountgarret, in 1642 during the Irish Confederate Wars and did not fall. It was captured in 1645 by James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven. The house was badly damaged by fire during the Williamite War and subsequently abandoned by the Jephsons. The Jephsons built the new mansion house on the site of the older castle's stable block.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nThe fortified house was made a National Monument in 1928. Commander Maurice Jephson sold the mansion to the McGinn family of Washington, D.C., in 1984. The castle and the grounds have been in the possession of Cork County Council since 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCork County Council, Council-owned supported attractions: Mallow Castle\nDiscover Ireland\nHistory of Mallow Castle\nEntry in Landed Estates Database",

        "wiki": "The sinking of the Cunard ocean liner RMS Lusitania occurred on Friday, 7 May 1915 during the First World War, as Germany waged submarine warfare against the United Kingdom which had implemented a naval blockade of Germany. The ship was identified and torpedoed by the German U-boat U-20, took on a heavy starboard list, and sank in 18 minutes. The vessel went down 11 miles (18 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, killing 1,198 and leaving 761 survivors. The sinking turned public opinion in many countries against Germany, contributed to the American entry into World War I and became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought.Lusitania fell victim to torpedo attack relatively early in the First World War, before tactics for evading submarines were properly implemented or understood. The contemporary investigations in both the United Kingdom and the United States into the precise causes of the ship's loss were obstructed by the needs of wartime secrecy and a propaganda campaign to ensure all blame fell upon Germany. Argument over whether the ship was a legitimate military target raged back and forth throughout the war as both sides made misleading claims about the ship. At the time she was sunk, she was carrying over 4 million rounds of small-arms ammunition (.303 caliber), almost 5,000 shrapnel shell casings (for a total of some 50 tons), and 3,240 brass percussion fuses, in addition to 1,266 passengers and a crew of 696. Several attempts have been made over the years since the sinking to dive to the wreck seeking information about precisely how the ship sank, and argument continues to the present day.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nWhen Lusitania was built, her construction and operating expenses were subsidized by the British government, with the provision that she could be converted to an Armed Merchant Cruiser if need be. At the outbreak of the First World War, the British Admiralty considered her for requisition as an armed merchant cruiser, and she was put on the official list of AMCs.The Admiralty then canceled their earlier decision and decided not to use her as an AMC after all; large liners such as Lusitania consumed enormous quantities of coal (910 tons/day, or 37.6 tons/hour) and became a serious drain on the Admiralty's fuel reserves, so express liners were deemed inappropriate for the role when smaller cruisers would do. They were also very distinctive; so smaller liners were used as transports instead. Lusitania remained on the official AMC list and was listed as an auxiliary cruiser in the 1914 edition of Jane's All the World's Fighting Ships, along with Mauretania.At the outbreak of hostilities, fears for the safety of Lusitania and other great liners ran high. During the ship's first eastbound crossing after the war started, she was painted in a drab grey colour scheme in an attempt to mask her identity and make her more difficult to detect visually. When it turned out that the German Navy was kept in check by the Royal Navy, and their commerce threat almost entirely evaporated, it very soon seemed that the Atlantic was safe for ships like Lusitania, if the bookings justified the expense of keeping them in service.\n\nMany of the large liners were laid up over the autumn and winter of 1914\u20131915, in part due to falling demand for passenger travel across the Atlantic, and in part to protect them from damage due to mines or other dangers. Among the most recognizable of these liners, some were eventually used as troop transports, while others became hospital ships. Lusitania remained in commercial service; although bookings aboard her were by no means strong during that autumn and winter, demand was strong enough to keep her in civilian service. Economizing measures were taken, however. One of these was the shutting down of her No. 4 boiler room to conserve coal and crew costs; this reduced her maximum speed from over 25 to 21 knots (46 to 39 km/h). Even so, she was the fastest first-class passenger liner left in commercial service.\nWith apparent dangers evaporating, the ship's disguised paint scheme was also dropped and she was returned to civilian colors. Her name was picked out in gilt, her funnels were repainted in their traditional Cunard livery, and her superstructure was painted white again. One alteration was the addition of a bronze/gold colored band around the base of the superstructure just above the black paint.\n\n\n=== 1915 ===\n\nBy early 1915, a new threat to British shipping began to materialise: U-boats (submarines). At first, the Germans used them only to attack naval vessels, and they achieved only occasional\u2014but sometimes spectacular\u2014successes. U-boats then began to attack merchant vessels at times, although almost always in accordance with the old cruiser rules. Desperate to gain an advantage on the Atlantic, the German government decided to step up its submarine campaign. On 4 February 1915, Germany declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone: from 18 February, Allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning. This was not wholly unrestricted submarine warfare, since efforts would be taken to avoid sinking neutral ships.Lusitania was scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on 6 March 1915. The Admiralty issued her specific instructions on how to avoid submarines. Despite a severe shortage of destroyers, Admiral Henry Oliver ordered HMS Louis and Laverock to escort Lusitania, and took the further precaution of sending the Q ship Lyons to patrol Liverpool Bay. One of the destroyers' commanders attempted to discover the whereabouts of Lusitania by telephoning Cunard, who refused to give out any information and referred him to the Admiralty. At sea, the ships contacted Lusitania by radio, but did not have the codes used to communicate with merchant ships. Captain Daniel Dow of Lusitania refused to give his own position except in code, and since he was, in any case, some distance from the positions he gave, continued to Liverpool unescorted.It seems that, in response to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the war zone; a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.Captain Dow, apparently suffering from stress from operating his ship in the war zone, and after a significant \"false flag\" controversy left the ship; Cunard later explained that he was \"tired and really ill.\" He was replaced with a new commander, Captain William Thomas Turner, who had previously commanded Lusitania, Mauretania, and Aquitania in the years before the war.\nOn 17 April 1915, Lusitania left Liverpool on her 201st transatlantic voyage, arriving in New York on 24 April. A group of German\u2013Americans, hoping to avoid controversy if Lusitania were attacked by a U-boat, discussed their concerns with a representative of the German Embassy. The embassy decided to warn passengers before her next crossing not to sail aboard Lusitania, and on 22 April placed a warning advertisement in 50 American newspapers, including those in New York:\n\nNotice!Travellers intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her allies and Great Britain and her allies; that the zone of war includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, in accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German Government, vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters and that travellers sailing in the war zone on the ships of Great Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.Imperial German Embassy\nWashington, D.C. 22 April 1915\n\nThis warning was printed adjacent to an advertisement for Lusitania's return voyage. The warning led to some agitation in the press and worried the ship's passengers and crew.\n\n\n== Final voyage ==\n\n\n=== Departure ===\nWhile many British passenger ships had been called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her traditional route between Liverpool and New York. She departed Pier 54 in New York on 1 May 1915 on her return trip to Liverpool with 1,959 people aboard. In addition to her crew of 694, she carried 1,265 passengers, mostly British nationals as well as a large number of Canadians, along with 128 Americans. Her First Class accommodations, for which she was famous on the North Atlantic run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce the squeeze into the limited number of two- and four-berth cabins, the situation was ultimately rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to be the norm for an eastbound crossing, with only 373 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.Captain Turner, known as \"Bowler Bill\" for his favourite shoreside headgear, had returned to his old command of Lusitania. He was commodore of the Cunard Line and a highly experienced master mariner, and had relieved Daniel Dow, the ship's regular captain. Dow had been instructed by his chairman, Alfred Booth, to take some leave, due to the stress of captaining the ship in U-boat infested sea lanes and for his protestations that the ship should not become an armed merchant cruiser, making her a prime target for German forces. Turner tried to calm the passengers by explaining that the ship's speed made her safe from attack by submarine. However, Cunard shut down one of the ship's four boiler rooms to reduce costs on sparsely subscribed wartime voyages, reducing her top speed from 25.5 to around 22 knots.Lusitania steamed out of New York at noon on 1 May, two hours behind schedule, because of a last-minute transfer of forty-one passengers and crew from the recently requisitioned Cameronia. Shortly after departure three German-speaking men were found on board hiding in a steward's pantry. Detective Inspector William Pierpoint of the Liverpool police, who was travelling in the guise of a first-class passenger, interrogated them before locking them in the cells for further questioning when the ship reached Liverpool. Also among the crew was an Englishman, Neal Leach, who had been working as a tutor in Germany before the war. Leach had been interned but later released by Germany. The German embassy in Washington was notified about Leach's arrival in America, where he met known German agents. Leach and the three German stowaways went down with the ship. They had probably been tasked with spying on Lusitania and her cargo. Most probably, Pierpoint, who survived the sinking, would already have been informed about Leach.\n\n\n=== Submarine activity ===\n\nAs the liner steamed across the ocean, the British Admiralty had been tracking the movements of U-20, commanded by Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Walther Schwieger, through wireless intercepts and radio direction finding. The submarine left Borkum on 30 April, heading north-west across the North Sea. On 2 May she had reached Peterhead and proceeded around the north of Scotland and Ireland, and then along the western and southern coasts of Ireland, to enter the Irish Sea from the south. Although the submarine's departure, destination, and expected arrival time were known to Room 40 in the Admiralty, the activities of the decoding department were considered so secret that they were unknown even to the normal intelligence division which tracked enemy ships or to the trade division responsible for warning merchant vessels. Only the very highest officers in the Admiralty saw the information and passed on warnings only when they felt it essential.On 27 March, Room 40 had intercepted a message which clearly demonstrated that the Germans had broken the code used to pass messages to British merchant ships. Cruisers protecting merchant ships were warned not to use the code to give directions to shipping because it could just as easily attract enemy submarines as steer ships away from them. However, Queenstown (now Cobh) was not given this warning and continued to give directions in the compromised code, which was not changed until after Lusitania's sinking. At this time, the Royal Navy was significantly involved with operations leading up to the landings at Gallipoli, and the intelligence department had been undertaking a program of misinformation to convince Germany to expect an attack on her northern coast. As part of this, ordinary cross-channel traffic to the Netherlands was halted from 19 April and false reports were leaked about troop ship movements from ports on Britain's western and southern coasts. This led to a demand from the German army for offensive action against the expected troop movements and consequently, a surge in German submarine activity on the British west coast. The fleet was warned to expect additional submarines, but this warning was not passed on to those sections of the navy dealing with merchant vessels. The return of the battleship Orion from Devonport to Scotland was delayed until 4 May and she was given orders to stay 100 miles (160 km) from the Irish coast.\n\nOn 5 May, U-20 stopped a merchant schooner, Earl of Lathom, off the Old Head of Kinsale, examined her papers, then ordered her crew to leave before sinking the schooner with gunfire. On 6 May, U-20 fired a torpedo at Cayo Romano from Cuba, a British steamer flying a neutral flag, off Fastnet Rock narrowly missing by a few feet. At 22:30 on 5 May, the Royal Navy sent an uncoded warning to all ships \u2013 \"Submarines active off the south coast of Ireland\" \u2013 and at midnight an addition was made to the regular nightly warnings, \"submarine off Fastnet\". On 6 May U-20 sank the 6,000 ton steamer Candidate. It then failed to get off a shot at the 16,000 ton liner Arabic, because although she kept a straight course the liner was too fast, but then sank another 6,000 ton British cargo ship flying no flag, Centurion, all in the region of the Coningbeg light ship. The specific mention of a submarine was dropped from the midnight broadcast on 6\u20137 May as news of the new sinkings had not yet reached the navy at Queenstown, and it was correctly assumed that there was no longer a submarine at Fastnet.Captain Turner of Lusitania was given a warning message twice on the evening of 6 May, and took what he felt were prudent precautions. That evening a Seamen's Charities fund concert took place throughout the ship and the captain was obliged to attend the event in the first-class lounge.At about 11:00 on 7 May, the Admiralty radioed another warning to all ships, probably as a result of a request by Alfred Booth, who was concerned about Lusitania: \"U-boats active in southern part of Irish Channel. Last heard of twenty miles south of Coningbeg Light Vessel\". Booth and all of Liverpool had received news of the sinkings, which the admiralty had known about by at least 3:00 that morning. Turner adjusted his heading northeast, not knowing that this report related to events of the previous day and apparently thinking submarines would be more likely to keep to the open sea, so that Lusitania would be safer close to land. At 13:00 another message was received, \"Submarine five miles south of Cape Clear proceeding west when sighted at 10:00 am\". This report was entirely inaccurate as no submarine had been at that location, but gave the impression that at least one submarine had been safely passed.U-20 was low on fuel and had only three torpedoes left. On the morning of 7 May, visibility was poor and Schwieger decided to head for home. He submerged at 11:00 after sighting a fishing boat which he believed might be a British patrol and shortly after was passed while still submerged by a ship at high speed. This was the cruiser Juno returning to Queenstown, travelling fast and zig-zagging having received warning of submarine activity off Queenstown at 07:45. The Admiralty considered these old cruisers highly vulnerable to submarines, and indeed Schwieger attempted to target the ship.\n\n\n=== Sinking ===\n\nOn the morning of 6 May, Lusitania was 750 miles (1,210 km) west of southern Ireland. By 05:00 on 7 May she reached a point 120 miles (190 km) west south west of Fastnet Rock (off the southern tip of Ireland), where she met the patrolling boarding vessel Partridge. By 06:00, heavy fog had arrived and extra lookouts were posted. As the ship came closer to Ireland, Captain Turner ordered depth soundings to be made and at 08:00 for speed to be reduced to eighteen knots, then to 15 knots and for the foghorn to be sounded. Some of the passengers were disturbed that the ship appeared to be advertising her presence. By 10:00 the fog began to lift, by noon it had been replaced by bright sunshine over a clear smooth sea and speed increased to 18 knots.U-20 surfaced again at 12:45 as visibility was now excellent. At 13:20 something was sighted and Schwieger was summoned to the conning tower: at first it appeared to be several ships because of the number of funnels and masts, but this resolved into one large steamer appearing over the horizon. At 13:25 the submarine submerged to periscope depth of 11 metres and set a course to intercept the liner at her maximum submerged speed of 9 knots. When the ships had closed to 2 miles (3.2 km) Lusitania turned away, Schwieger feared he had lost his target, but she turned again, this time onto a near ideal course to bring her into position for an attack. At 14:10 with the target at 700m range he ordered one gyroscopic torpedo to be fired, set to run at a depth of three metres.In Schwieger's own words, recorded in the log of U-20:\n\nTorpedo hits starboard side right behind the bridge. An unusually heavy detonation takes place with a very strong explosive cloud. The explosion of the torpedo must have been followed by a second one [boiler or coal or powder?]... The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly, immersing simultaneously at the bow... the name Lusitania becomes visible in golden letters. U-20's torpedo officer, Raimund Weisbach, viewed the destruction through the vessel's periscope and felt the explosion was unusually severe. Within six minutes, Lusitania's forecastle began to submerge.\nOn board the Lusitania, Leslie Morton, an eighteen-year-old lookout at the bow, had spotted thin lines of foam racing toward the ship. He shouted, \"Torpedoes coming on the starboard side!\" through a megaphone, thinking the bubbles came from two projectiles. The torpedo struck Lusitania under the bridge, sending a plume of debris, steel plating, and water upward and knocking lifeboat number five off its davits. \"It sounded like a million-ton hammer hitting a steam boiler a hundred feet high,\" one passenger said. A second, more powerful explosion followed, sending a geyser of water, coal, dust, and debris high above the deck. Schwieger's log entries attest that he launched only one torpedo. Some doubt the validity of this claim, contending that the German government subsequently altered the published fair copy of Schwieger's log, but accounts from other U-20 crew members corroborate it. The entries were also consistent with intercepted radio reports sent to Germany by U-20 once she had returned to the North Sea, before any possibility of an official coverup.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nAt 14:12, Captain Turner ordered Quartermaster Johnston stationed at the ship's wheel to steer 'hard-a-starboard' towards the Irish coast, which Johnston confirmed, but the ship could not be steadied on the course and rapidly ceased to respond to the wheel. Turner signalled for the engines to be reversed to halt the ship, but although the signal was received in the engine room, nothing could be done. Steam pressure had collapsed from 195 psi before the explosion, to 50 psi and falling afterwards. Lusitania's wireless operator sent out an immediate SOS, which was acknowledged by a coastal wireless station. Shortly afterward he transmitted the ship's position, 10 miles (16 km) south of the Old Head of Kinsale. At 14:14 electrical power failed, plunging the cavernous interior of the ship into darkness. Radio signals continued on emergency batteries, but electric lifts failed, trapping passengers and crew; bulkhead doors, that were closed as a precaution before the attack, could not be reopened to release trapped men.About one minute after the electrical power failed, Captain Turner gave the order to abandon ship. Water had flooded the ship's starboard longitudinal compartments, causing a 15-degree list to starboard.\nLusitania's severe starboard list complicated the launch of her lifeboats. Ten minutes after the torpedoing, when she had slowed enough to start putting boats in the water, the lifeboats on the starboard side swung out too far to step aboard safely. While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.\n\nMany lifeboats overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers into the sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion when they hit the water. It has been claimed that some boats, because of the negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 (5 people on board) and 11 (7 people on board) managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, overloaded with around 150 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 (52 people on board) reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided flotation for some survivors.\nTwo lifeboats on the port side cleared the ship as well. Lifeboat 14 (11 people on board) was lowered and launched safely, but because the boat plug was not in place, it filled with seawater and sank almost immediately after reaching the water. Later, Lifeboat 2 floated away from the ship with new occupants (its previous ones having been spilled into the sea when they upset the boat) after they removed a rope and one of the ship's \"tentacle-like\" funnel stays. They rowed away shortly before the ship sank.\nThere was panic and disorder on the decks. Schwieger had been observing this through U-20's periscope, and by 14:25, he dropped the periscope and headed out to sea. Later in the war, Schwieger was killed in action when, as he commanded U-88 the vessel struck a British mine and sank on 5 September 1917, north of Terschelling. There were no survivors from U-88's sinking.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nCaptain Turner was on the deck near the bridge clutching the ship's logbook and charts when a wave swept upward towards the bridge and the rest of the ship's forward superstructure, knocking him overboard into the sea. He managed to swim and find a chair floating in the water which he clung to. He survived, having been pulled unconscious from the water after spending three hours there. Lusitania's bow slammed into the bottom about 100 metres (330 ft) below at a shallow angle because of her forward momentum as she sank. Along the way, some boilers exploded, including one that caused the third funnel to collapse; the remaining funnels collapsed soon after. As he had taken the ship's logbook and charts with him, Turner's last navigational fix had been only two minutes before the torpedoing, and he was able to remember the ship's speed and bearing at the moment of the sinking. This was accurate enough to locate the wreck after the war. The ship travelled about two miles (3 km) from the time of the torpedoing to her final resting place, leaving a trail of debris and people behind. After her bow sank completely, Lusitania's stern rose out of the water, enough for her propellers to be seen, and went under.\nLusitania sank in only 18 minutes, 11.5 miles (19 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale. It took several hours for help to arrive from the Irish coast, but by the time help had arrived, many in the 52 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C) water had succumbed to the cold. By the days' end, 764 passengers and crew from Lusitania had been rescued and landed at Queenstown. Eventually, the final death toll for the disaster came to a catastrophic number. Of the 1,959 passengers and crew aboard Lusitania at the time of her sinking, 1,195 had been lost. In the days following the disaster, the Cunard line offered local fishermen and sea merchants a cash reward for the bodies floating all throughout the Irish Sea, some floating as far away as the Welsh coast. In all, only 289 bodies were recovered, 65 of which were never identified. The bodies of many of the victims were buried at either Queenstown, where 148 bodies were interred in the Old Church Cemetery, or the Church of St. Multose in Kinsale, but the bodies of the remaining 885 victims were never recovered.\nTwo days before, U-20 had sunk Earl of Lathom, but first allowed the crew to escape in boats. According to international maritime law, any military vessel stopping an unarmed civilian ship was required to allow those on board time to escape before sinking it. The conventions had been drawn up in a time before the invention of the submarine and took no account of the severe risk a small vessel, such as a submarine, faced if it gave up the advantage of a surprise attack. Schwieger could have allowed the crew and passengers of Lusitania to take to the boats, but he considered the danger of being rammed or fired upon by deck guns too great. Merchant ships had, in fact, been advised to steer directly at any U-boat that surfaced. A cash bonus had been offered for any that were sunk, though the advice was carefully worded so as not to amount to an order to ram. This feat would be accomplished only once during the war by a commercial vessel when in 1918 the White Star Liner RMS Olympic, sister ship to the Titanic, rammed into SM U-103 in the English Channel, sinking the submarine.\nAccording to Bailey and Ryan, Lusitania was travelling without any flag and her name painted over with darkish dye.One story\u2014an urban legend\u2014states that when Lieutenant Schwieger of U-20 gave the order to fire, his quartermaster, Charles Voegele, would not take part in an attack on women and children, and refused to pass on the order to the torpedo room \u2013 a decision for which he was court-martialed and imprisoned at Kiel until the end of the war. This rumour persisted from 1972, when the French daily paper Le Monde published a letter to the editor.\n\n\n=== Notable passengers ===\n\n\n==== Survived ====\n\nCrewWilliam Thomas Turner, 59.

Most of the survivors (and dead) had been taken to Queenstown instead of Kinsale, which was closer. On 10 May Captain Turner gave evidence as to the events of the sinking where he described that the ship had been struck by one torpedo between the third and fourth funnels. This had been followed immediately by a second explosion. He acknowledged receiving general warnings about submarines, but had not been informed of the sinking of Earl of Lathom. He stated that he had received other instructions from the Admiralty which he had carried out but was not permitted to discuss. The coroner brought in a verdict that the deceased had drowned following an attack on an unarmed non-combatant vessel contrary to international law. Half an hour after the inquest had concluded and its results given to the press, the Crown Solicitor for Cork, Harry Wynne, arrived with instructions to halt it. Captain Turner was not to give evidence and no statements should be made about any instructions given to shipping about avoiding submarines.\n\n\n=== Board of Trade investigation ===\n\nThe formal Board of Trade investigation into the sinking was presided over by Wreck Commissioner Lord Mersey and took place in the Westminster Central Hall from 15\u201318 June 1915 with further sessions at the Westminster Palace Hotel on 1 July and Caxton Hall on 17 July. Lord Mersey had a background in commercial rather than maritime law but had presided over a number of important maritime investigations, including that into the loss of Titanic. He was assisted by four assessors, Admiral Sir Frederick Samuel Inglefield, Lieutenant Commander Hearn and two merchant navy captains, D. Davies and J. Spedding. The Attorney General, Sir Edward Carson, represented the Board of Trade, assisted by the Solicitor General, F. E. Smith. Butler Aspinall, who had previously represented the Board of Trade at the Titanic inquiry, was retained to represent Cunard. A total of 36 witnesses were called, Lord Mersey querying why more of the survivors would not be giving evidence. Most of the sessions were public but two on 15 and 18 June were held in camera when evidence regarding navigation of the ship was presented.Statements were collected from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, and that it had been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses said there had been two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.\n\nIt was during the closed hearings that the Admiralty tried to lay the blame on Captain Turner, their intended line being that Turner had been negligent. The roots of this view began in the first reports about the sinking from Vice-Admiral Coke commanding the navy at Queenstown. He reported that \"ship was especially warned that submarines were active on south coast and to keep mid-channel course avoiding headlands also position of submarine off Cape Clear at 10:00 was communicated by W/T to her\". Captain Webb, Director of the Trade Division, began to prepare a dossier of signals sent to Lusitania which Turner may have failed to observe. First Sea Lord Fisher noted on one document submitted by Webb for review: \"As the Cunard company would not have employed an incompetent man its a certainty that Captain Turner is not a fool but a knave. I hope that Turner will be arrested immediately after the enquiry whatever the verdict\". First Lord Winston Churchill noted: \"I consider the Admiralty's case against Turner should be pressed by a skilful counsel and that Captain Webb should attend as a witness, if not employed as an assessor. We will pursue the captain without check\". In the event, both Churchill and Fisher were replaced in their positions before the enquiry because of the failures of the Gallipoli campaign.\n\nPart of the proceedings turned on the question of proper evasive tactics against submarines. It was put to Captain Turner that he had failed to comply with Admiralty instructions to travel at high speed, maintain a zig-zag course and keep away from shore. Naval instructions about zig-zag were read to the captain, who confirmed that he had received them, though later added that they did not appear to be as he recollected. This was unsurprising, since the regulations quoted had been approved only on 25 April, after Lusitania's last arrival in New York, and started distribution on 13 May, after she sank. Lusitania had slowed to 15 knots at one point because of fog, but had otherwise maintained 18 knots passing Ireland. 18 knots was faster than all but nine other ships in the British merchant fleet could achieve and was comfortably faster than the submarine. Although he might have achieved 21 knots and had given orders to raise steam ready to do so, he was also under orders to time his arrival at Liverpool for high tide so that the ship would not have to wait to enter port. Thus, he chose to travel more slowly. At the time, no ship had been torpedoed travelling at more than 15 knots. Although the Admiralty instructed ships to keep well offshore and it was claimed that Turner had only been 8 miles (13 km) away, his actual distance when hit was thirteen miles (21 km). As a matter of established procedure, only ships travelling closer than five miles (8.0 km) from shore were ordinarily being censured for being too close.Turner stated that he had discussed the matter of what course the ship should take with his two most senior officers, Captain Anderson and Chief Officer Piper, neither of whom survived. The three had agreed that the Admiralty warning of \"submarine activity 20 miles (32 km) south of Coningbeg\" effectively overrode other Admiralty advice to keep to 'mid channel', which was precisely where the submarine had been reported. He had, therefore, ordered the change of course at 12:40, intending to bring the ship closer to land and then take a course north of the reported submarine.At one point in the proceedings, Smith attempted to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that it was his job to get at the truth, and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.\n\nOn 10 June, just before the hearing, significant changes were made to the Defence of the Realm Act, which made it an offence to collect or publish information about the nature, use, or carriage of \"war materials\" for any reason. Previously, this had only been an offence if the information was collected to aid the enemy. This was used to prohibit discussion about the ship's cargo. The rifle cartridges carried by Lusitania were mentioned during the case, Lord Mersey stating that \"the 5,000 cases of ammunition on board were 50 yards away from where the torpedo struck the ship\".An additional hearing took place on 1 July, at the insistence of Joseph Marichal, who was threatening to sue Cunard for their poor handling of the disaster. He testified that the second explosion had sounded to him like the rattling of machine gun fire and appeared to be below the second class dining room at the rear of the ship where he had been seated. Information about Marechal's background was sought out by the British government and leaked to the press so as to discredit him.Captain Turner, the Cunard Company, and the Royal Navy were absolved of any negligence, and all blame was placed on the German government. Lord Mersey found that Turner \"exercised his judgment for the best\" and that the blame for the disaster \"must rest solely with those who plotted and with those who committed the crime\".Two days after he closed the inquiry, Lord Mersey waived his fees for the case and formally resigned. His last words on the subject were: \"The Lusitania case was a damned, dirty business!\" The full report has never been made available to the public. A copy was thought to exist amongst Lord Mersey's private papers after his death, but has since proved untraceable.\n\n\n=== American court proceedings ===\nIn the United States, 67 claims for compensation were lodged against Cunard, which were all heard together in 1918 before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Julius Mayer, presided over the case: he had previously presided over the case brought following the loss of the Titanic, where he had ruled in favour of the shipping company. Mayer was a conservative who was considered a safe pair of hands with matters of national interest, and whose favourite remark to lawyers was to \"come to the point\". The case was to be heard without a jury. The two sides agreed beforehand that no question would be raised regarding whether Lusitania had been armed or carrying troops or ammunition. Thirty-three witnesses who could not travel to the US gave statements in England to Commissioner R. V. Wynne. Evidence produced in open court for the Mersey investigation was considered, but evidence from the British closed sessions was not. The Defence of the Realm Act was invoked so that British witnesses could not give evidence on any subject it covered. Statements had been collected in Queenstown immediately after the sinking by the American Consul, Wesley Frost, but these were not produced.Captain Turner gave evidence in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that up until the time of the sinking he had no reason to think that zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30 minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.\nMany witnesses testified that portholes across the ship had been open at the time of the sinking, and an expert witness confirmed that such a porthole three feet under water would let in four tons of water per minute. Testimony varied on how many torpedoes there had been, and whether the strike occurred between the first and second funnel, or third and fourth. The nature of the official cargo was considered, but experts considered that under no conditions could the cargo have exploded. A record exists that Crewman Jack Roper wrote to Cunard in 1919 requesting expenses for his testimony in accord with the line indicated by Cunard.The decision was rendered on 23 August 1918. Mayer's judgement was that \"the cause of the sinking was the illegal act of the Imperial German Government\", that two torpedoes had been involved, that the captain had acted properly and emergency procedures had been up to the standard then expected. He ruled that further claims for compensation should be addressed to the German government (which eventually paid $2.5 million in 1925).\n\n\n== International reaction ==\n\n\n=== German reaction ===\n\nOn 8 May Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former German Colonial Secretary, made a statement in Cleveland, Ohio, in which he attempted to justify the sinking of Lusitania. At the time Dernburg was recognised as the official spokesman of the Imperial German government in the United States. Dernburg said that because Lusitania \"carried contraband of war\" and also because she \"was classed as an auxiliary cruiser\" Germany had had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard. Dernburg further said that the warnings given by the German Embassy before her sailing, plus the 18 February note declaring the existence of \"war zones\" relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of the American citizens aboard. He referred to the ammunition and military goods declared on Lusitania's manifest and said that \"vessels of that kind\" could be seized and destroyed under the Hague rules without any respect to a war zone.The following day the German government issued an official communication regarding the sinking in which it said that the Cunard liner Lusitania \"was yesterday torpedoed by a German submarine and sank\", that Lusitania \"was naturally armed with guns, as were recently most of the English mercantile steamers\" and that \"as is well known here, she had large quantities of war material in her cargo\".\nDudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port of New York, issued an official denial to the German charges, saying that Lusitania had been inspected before her departure and no guns were found, mounted or unmounted. Malone stated that no merchant ship would have been allowed to arm itself in the Port and leave the harbour. Assistant Manager of the Cunard Line, Herman Winter, denied the charge that she carried munitions:She had aboard 4,200 cases of cartridges, but they were cartridges for small arms, packed in separate cases... they certainly do not come under the classification of ammunition. The United States authorities would not permit us to carry ammunition, classified as such by the military authorities, on a passenger liner. For years we have been sending small-arms cartridges abroad on the Lusitania.The fact that Lusitania had been carrying shell casings and rifle cartridges was not made known to the British public at the time, as it was felt that, although allowed under the regulations of the time, it would be used in German propaganda.The sinking was severely criticised by and met with disapproval in Turkey and Austria-Hungary, while in the German press, the sinking was deplored by Vorw\u00e4rts, the daily newspaper of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and also by Captain Persius, an outspoken naval critic who wrote for the Berliner Tageblatt.One Catholic Centre Party newspaper, the K\u00f6lnische Volkszeitung, stated: \"The sinking of the giant English steamship is a success of moral significance which is still greater than material success. With joyful pride we contemplate this latest deed of our Navy. It will not be the last. The English wish to abandon the German people to death by starvation. We are more humane. We simply sank an English ship with passengers who, at their own risk and responsibility, entered the zone of operations.\"In the aftermath of the sinking, the German government tried to justify it by claiming in an official statement that she had been armed with guns, and had \"large quantities of war material\" in her cargo. They also stated that since she was classed as an auxiliary cruiser, Germany had had a right to destroy her regardless of any passengers aboard, and that the warnings issued by the German Embassy before her sailing plus 18 February note declaring the existence of \"war zones\", relieved Germany of any responsibility for the deaths of American citizens aboard. While it was true that Lusitania had been fitted with gun mounts as part of government loan requirements during her construction, to enable rapid conversion into an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC) in the event of war, the guns themselves were never fitted. However, she was still listed officially as an AMC. Her cargo had included an estimated 4,200,000 rifle cartridges, 1,250 empty shell cases, and 18 cases of non-explosive fuses, all of which were listed in her manifest, but the cartridges were not officially classed as ammunition by the Cunard Line.\n\n\n=== British and American actions ===\n\nSchwieger was condemned in the Allied press as a war criminal.\nOf the 139 US citizens aboard Lusitania, 128 lost their lives, and there was massive outrage in Britain and America, The Nation calling it \"a deed for which a Hun would blush, a Turk be ashamed, and a Barbary pirate apologize\" and the British felt that the Americans had to declare war on Germany. However, US President Woodrow Wilson refused to over-react. He said at Philadelphia on 10 May 1915:\n\nThere is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right.\nWhen Germany began its submarine campaign against Britain, Wilson had warned that the US would hold the German government strictly accountable for any violations of American rights. On 1 May he stated that \"no warning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed\" could be accepted as a legitimate excuse for that act.During the weeks after the sinking, the issue was hotly debated within the administration. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan urged compromise and restraint. The US, he believed, should try to persuade the British to abandon their interdiction of foodstuffs and limit their mine-laying operations at the same time as the Germans were persuaded to curtail their submarine campaign. He also suggested that the US government issue an explicit warning against US citizens travelling on any belligerent ships. Despite being sympathetic to Bryan's antiwar feelings, Wilson insisted that the German government must apologise for the sinking, compensate US victims, and promise to avoid any similar occurrence in the future.\n\n\n=== Wilson notes ===\n\nBacked by State Department second-in-command Robert Lansing, Wilson made his position clear in three notes to the German government issued on 13 May, 9 June, and 21 July.\nThe first note affirmed the right of Americans to travel as passengers on merchant ships and called for the Germans to abandon submarine warfare against commercial vessels, whatever flag they sailed under (including 3 other ships: the Falaba, the Cushing, and the Gulflight).\nIn the second note, Wilson rejected the German arguments that the British blockade was illegal, and was a cruel and deadly attack on innocent civilians, and their charge that Lusitania had been carrying munitions. William Jennings Bryan considered Wilson's second note too provocative and resigned in protest after failing to moderate it, to be replaced by Robert Lansing who later said in his memoirs that following the tragedy he always had the \"conviction that we [the United States] would ultimately become the ally of Britain\".\nThe third note, of 21 July, issued an ultimatum, to the effect that the US would regard any subsequent sinkings as \"deliberately unfriendly\".\nWhile the American public and leadership were not ready for war, the path to an eventual declaration of war had been set as a result of the sinking of Lusitania. On 19 August U-24 sank the White Star liner Arabic, with the loss of 44 passengers and crew, three of whom were American. The German government, while insisting on the legitimacy of its campaign against Allied shipping, disavowed the sinking of Arabic; it offered an indemnity and pledged to order submarine commanders to abandon unannounced attacks on merchant and passenger vessels.The British public, press, and government in general were upset at Wilson's actions \u2013 not realising it reflected general US opinion at the time. They sneered \"too proud or too scared?\". Shells that did not explode at the front were called \"Wilsons\".\nGermany, however, continued to sink merchant vessels bound for Britain, particularly after the Battle of Jutland in late May 1916.\n\n\n=== German policy reversal ===\nGerman Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg persuaded the Kaiser to forbid action against ships flying neutral flags and the U-boat war was postponed once again on 27 August, as it was realised that British ships could easily fly neutral flags.There was disagreement over this move between the navy's admirals (headed by Alfred von Tirpitz) and Bethman-Hollweg. Backed by Army Chief of Staff Erich von Falkenhayn, Kaiser Wilhelm II endorsed the Chancellor's solution, and Tirpitz and the Admiralty backed down. The German restriction order of 9 September 1915 stated that attacks were allowed only on ships that were definitely British, while neutral ships were to be treated under the Prize Law rules, and no attacks on passenger liners were to be permitted at all. The war situation demanded that there could be no possibility of orders being misinterpreted, and on 18 September Henning von Holtzendorff, the new head of the German Admiralty, issued a secret order: all U-boats operating in the English Channel and off the west coast of the United Kingdom were recalled, and the U-boat war would continue only in the North sea, where it would be conducted under the Prize Law rules.In January 1917 the German Government announced it would now conduct full unrestricted submarine warfare. Once again, Woodrow Wilson was furious and on 6 April 1917 the United States Congress followed Wilson's request to declare war on Germany. US buildup of participation was at first slow, but during the German Spring Offensive in March 1918, which at first went well for the Germans with the Allies barely holding the lines, was reversed with the arrival by April 1918 of two million American troops.\n\n\n=== British propaganda ===\n\nIt was in the interests of the British to keep US citizens aware of German actions and attitudes. One over-enthusiastic propagandist's fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of Lusitania. This story was based on the popular reception given the Goetz medal (see below) and was so effective that James W. Gerard, the US ambassador to Germany, recounted it being told in his memoir of his time in Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without vouching for its validity.\n\n\n==== Goetz medal ====\n\nIn August 1915, the Munich medallist and sculptor Karl X. Goetz (1875\u20131950), who had produced a series of propagandist and satirical medals as a running commentary on the war, privately struck a small run of medals as a limited-circulation satirical attack (fewer than 500 were struck) on the Cunard Line for trying to continue business as usual during wartime. Goetz blamed both the British government and the Cunard Line for allowing Lusitania to sail despite the German embassy's warnings. Popular demand led to many unauthorised copies being made.\nOne side of the popular medal showed Lusitania sinking laden with guns (incorrectly depicted sinking stern first) with the motto \"KEINE BANNWARE!\" (\"NO CONTRABAND!\"), while the reverse showed a skeleton selling Cunard tickets with the motto \"Gesch\u00e4ft \u00dcber Alles\" (\"Business Above All\").Goetz had put an incorrect date for the sinking on the medal, an error he later blamed on a mistake in a newspaper story about the sinking: instead of 7 May, he had put \"5. Mai\", two days before the actual sinking. Not realising his error, Goetz made copies of the medal and sold them in Munich and also to some numismatic dealers with whom he conducted business.\nThe British Foreign Office obtained a copy of the medal, photographed it, and sent copies to the United States where it was published in the New York Times on 5 May 1916. Many popular magazines ran photographs of the medal, and it was falsely claimed that it had been awarded to the crew of the U-boat.Emile Henry Lacombe wrote a letter to the New York Times advancing a conspiracy theory about the German sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. His letter was published Monday 22 October 1917 on page 14 titled \"A NEW THEORY OF THE LUSITANIA SINKING. The Evidence of the German Medal Dated May 5 and the Report of the Explosive \"Cigars\" on Board.\"\n\n\n==== British replica of Goetz medal ====\n\nThe Goetz medal attracted so much attention that Lord Newton, who was in charge of Propaganda at the Foreign Office in 1916, decided to develop the anti-German feelings aroused by it for propaganda purposes and asked department store entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge to reproduce the medal again. The replica medals were produced in an attractive case and were an exact copy of the German medal, and were sold for a shilling apiece. On the cases it was stated that the medals had been distributed in Germany \"to commemorate the sinking of Lusitania\" and they came with a propaganda leaflet which strongly denounced the Germans and used the medal's incorrect date (5 May) to incorrectly claim that the sinking of Lusitania was premeditated, rather than just being incident to Germany's larger plan to sink any ship in a combat zone without warning. The head of the Lusitania Souvenir Medal Committee later estimated that 250,000 were sold, proceeds being given to the Red Cross and St. Dunstan's Blinded Soldiers and Sailors Hostel. Unlike the original Goetz medals which were sand-cast from bronze, the British copies were of diecast iron and were of poorer quality. However, a few original medals were also made in iron. Originals usually have \"KGoetz\" on the edge. Over the years various other copies have been made.Belatedly realising his mistake, Goetz issued a corrected medal with the date of \"7. Mai\". The Bavarian government, alarmed at the strong worldwide reaction to Goetz's work, suppressed the medal and ordered confiscation in April 1917. The original German medals can easily be distinguished from the English copies because the date is in German, i.e. with a dot behind the numeral; the English version was altered to read 'May' rather than 'Mai'. After the war Goetz expressed his regret that his work had been the cause of increasing anti-German feelings, but it remains a celebrated propaganda act.\n\n\n=== Baudichon medal ===\n\nCirca 1920 the French medallist Ren\u00e9 Baudichon created a counterblast to the Goetz medal. The Baudichon medal is in bronze, 54 millimetres (2.1 in) diameter and weighs 79.51 grams (2.805 oz). The obverse shows Liberty as depicted on the Statue of Liberty but holding a raised sword and rising from a stormy sea. Behind her the sun is breaking through clouds and six ships are steaming. Signed R Baudichon. Legend: Ultrix America Juris, 1917 U.S.A 1918 (America avenger of right). The reverse shows a view of the starboard quarter of the Lusitania correctly depicted sinking bow first. In the foreground there is a capsized lifeboat. The upper field shows a child drowning, head, hands and feet above the water; RB monogram. Legend: Lusitania May 7, 1915.\n\n\n== Last survivors ==\n\nThe last survivor was Audrey Warren Lawson-Johnston (n\u00e9e Pearl), who was born in New York City on 15 February 1915. She was the fourth of six children (the youngest two born after the disaster) born to Major Frederic \"Frank\" Warren Pearl (26 August 1869 \u2013 2 January 1952) and Amy Lea (n\u00e9e Duncan; 12 November 1880 \u2013 1 February 1964). She was only three months old when she boarded Lusitania in New York with her parents, three siblings, and two nurses \u2013 and due to her age had no first hand recollection of the disaster. She and her brother Stuart (age 5) were saved by their British nursemaid Alice Maud Lines, then 18 years old, who jumped off the boat deck and escaped in a lifeboat. Her parents also survived, but her sisters Amy (age 3) and Susan (age 14 months) died. Pearl married Hugh de Beauchamp Lawson-Johnston, second son of George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke, on 18 July 1946. They had three children and lived in Melchbourne, Bedfordshire. Hugh was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1961. Johnston gifted an inshore lifeboat, Amy Lea, to New Quay Lifeboat Station in 2004 in memory of her mother. Johnston died on 11 January 2011.The last American survivor was Barbara McDermott (born Barbara Winifred Anderson in Connecticut on 15 June 1912, to Roland Anderson and Emily Pybus). She was three years old at the time of the sinking. Her father worked as a draftsman for an ammunitions factory in south-western Connecticut. He was unable to accompany his wife and daughter on Lusitania as the First World War had created high demands for ammunition manufacturing at the factory where he worked. Barbara recalled being in the ship's dining room eating dessert when the torpedo hit. She remembered holding onto her spoon as she saw fellow passengers running about the badly damaged ship. In the midst of chaos, Barbara was separated from her mother and loaded into Lifeboat No. 15. Barbara later learned that her mother fell into the sea but was rescued and placed into the same lifeboat as her daughter. Neither Barbara nor her mother was seriously injured. After their rescue, Barbara and her mother travelled to Darlington, County Durham, England, to live with Barbara's maternal grandmother. Barbara's mother died on 22 March 1917 at the age of 28. Two years later, Barbara left Britain and travelled back to the United States aboard Mauretania and arrived in New York City on 26 December 1919. Barbara died on 12 April 2008 in Wallingford, Connecticut, at the age of 95.\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\n\n\n=== In film ===\n\nThere is no footage of the sinking.\n\nAnimation pioneer Winsor McCay spent nearly two years animating the disaster for his film The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918). At 12 minutes, it was the longest animated film on record at the time. It was also the earliest-known dramatic animation.\nThe docudrama Sinking of the Lusitania: Terror at Sea (2007) depicts the last voyage of the Lusitania and the political and military decisions that led to the sinking.\nThe National Geographic documentary Dark Secrets of the Lusitania (2012) describes an expedition investigating the wreck made by Greg Bemis and a crew of divers in 2011.\n\n\n=== In exhibits ===\n\nThe Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool has a large display about Lusitania sinking, and one of the ship's propellers is displayed at the museum.\u00b0A well-preserved lifeboat davit and other artifacts are on the display at the Lusitania Museum and Memorial Garden on the Old Head of Kinsale, Co. Cork, Ireland, overlooking the site of the disaster: www.oldheadofkinsale.com.\n\nThe original builder's model of Lusitania, repainted after the sinking to represent RMS Mauretania, is displayed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n=== In literature ===\nThe events of Agatha Christie's novel The Secret Adversary are set off by the sinking of Lusitania.\nDavid Butler's novel Lusitania (1982) is a fictionalised account of the sinking and events leading up to it.\nErik Larson's non-fiction book, Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania (2015), describes the ship's final voyage from multiple perspectives.\nH.P. Lovecraft's first published book was The Crime of Crimes: Lusitania 1915 (published in Wales), a poem on the sinking of the vessel.\nGraham Masterton's 2002 novel A Terrible Beauty (Katie Maguire No. 1) (published as Black River in France) includes a scene that claims to find evidence of how British intelligence informed the German admiralty that a wanted murderer was aboard the ship, thus encouraging them to carry out the sinking.\nThe sinking was the inspiration for Michael Morpurgo's novel Listen to the Moon (2014).\nRobert H. Pilpel's novel To the Honor of the Fleet (1979) included the sinking of Lusitania as an important plot point concerning the adventures of two U.S. Navy intelligence officers, each attached to either the British Royal Navy or the Imperial German Navy, prior to the Battle of Jutland and the American entry into World War I.\n\n\n=== In music ===\nEnglish composer Frank Bridge had strong pacifist convictions and was deeply disturbed by the First World War. In 1915, he wrote his Lament (for Catherine, aged 9 \"Lusitania\" 1915), for string orchestra, as a memorial to the sinking of the ship. The piece was premiered by the New Queen's Hall Orchestra, conducted by the composer, on 15 September, at the 1915 Proms, as part of a programme of \"Popular Italian music\", the rest of which was conducted by Henry Wood.\nCharles Ives's Orchestral Set No. 2 concludes with a movement entitled, From Hanover Square North, at the End of a Tragic Day, the Voice of the People Again Arose. It recounts Ives's experience waiting for an elevated train in New York City as the news of the sinking of Lusitania came through. The passengers assembled on the platform began singing \"In The Sweet By and By\" in time to a barrel organ which was playing the tune. Echoes of their voices can be heard at the start of the music, and the hymn tune itself appears at the end.\nA popular song, \"As the Lusitania Went Down\" (1915) by Arthur J. Lamb and F. Henri Klickmann  was published by C. K. Root & Co. of Chicago and New York. It was described by The Music Trade Review on 29 May 1915 as \"One of the most interesting of the songs that have made their appearance in the commemoration of the Lusitania disaster.\"\nThe song \"When the Lusitania Went Down\" (1915) by Charles McCarron and Nat Vincent was published by Leo Feist, in New York. Columbia Records issued a recording sung by baritone Herbert Stuart (otherwise known as Albert Wiederhold) and with orchestra accompaniment, as an 80 rpm disc.\nThe song \"Lusitania\" from American black metal band Minenwerfer, on their sophomore album Nihilistischen.\n\u201cLusitania\u201d from American singer-songwriter Andrew Bird. The song features vocals by Annie Clark of St. Vincent.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nSee also RMS Lusitania#Conspiracy theories\n\n\n=== Cruiser rules and exclusion zones ===\nThe \"Prize rules\" or \"Cruiser rules\", laid down by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, governed the seizure of vessels at sea during wartime, although changes in technology such as radio and the submarine eventually made parts of them irrelevant. Merchant ships were to be warned by warships, and their passengers and crew allowed to abandon ship before they were sunk, unless the ship resisted or tried to escape, or was in a convoy protected by warships. Limited armament on a merchant ship, such as one or two guns, did not necessarily affect the ship's immunity to attack without warning, and neither did a cargo of munitions or materiel.\nIn November 1914 the British announced that the entire North Sea was now a War Zone, and issued orders restricting the passage of neutral shipping into and through the North Sea to special channels where supervision would be possible (the other approaches having been mined). It was in response to this, and to the British Admiralty's order of 31 January 1915 that British merchant ships should fly neutral colours as a ruse de guerre, that Admiral Hugo von Pohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet, published a warning in the Deutscher Reichsanzeiger (Imperial German Gazette) on 4 February 1915:\n\n(1) The waters around Great Britain and Ireland, including the whole of the English Channel, are hereby declared to be a War Zone. From February 18 onwards every enemy merchant vessel encountered in this zone will be destroyed, nor will it always be possible to avert the danger thereby threatened to the crew and passengers.\n(2) Neutral vessels also will run a risk in the War Zone, because in view of the hazards of sea warfare and the British authorization of January 31 of the misuse of neutral flags, it may not always be possible to prevent attacks on enemy ships from harming neutral ships.\nIn response, the Admiralty issued orders on 10 February 1915 which directed merchant ships to escape from hostile U-boats when possible, but \"if a submarine comes up suddenly close ahead of you with obvious hostile intention, steer straight for her at your utmost speed...\" Further instructions ten days later advised armed steamers to open fire on a submarine even if it had not yet fired. Given the extreme vulnerability of a submarine to ramming or even small-caliber shellfire, a U-boat that surfaced and gave warning against a merchantman which had been given such instructions was putting itself in great danger. The Germans knew of these orders, even though they were intended to be secret, copies having been obtained from captured ships and from wireless intercepts; Bailey and Ryan in their \"The Lusitania Disaster\", put much emphasis on these Admiralty orders to merchantmen, arguing it was unreasonable to expect a submarine to surface and give warning under such circumstances. In their opinion this, rather than the munitions, the nonexistent armament, or any other suggested reason, is the best rationale for the Germans' actions in the sinking.\n\n\n=== Contraband and second explosion ===\nThe cargo included 4,200,000 rounds of Remington .303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty 3-inch (76 mm) fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, all of which were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings.\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Robert Ballard, the famous explorer who discovered Titanic and Bismarck, conducted an in-depth exploration of the wreck of Lusitania. Ballard tried to confirm John Light's findings of a large hole on the port side of the wreck, and he didn't find anything. During his investigation, Ballard noted a large quantity of coal on the sea bed near the wreck, and after consulting an explosives expert advanced the theory of a coal dust explosion. He believed dust in the bunkers would have been thrown into the air by the vibration from the explosion; the resulting cloud would have been ignited by a spark, causing the second explosion. In the years since he first advanced this theory, it has been argued that this is nearly impossible. Critics of the theory say coal dust would have been too damp to have been stirred into the air by the torpedo impact in explosive concentrations; additionally, the coal bunker where the torpedo struck would have been flooded almost immediately by seawater flowing through the damaged hull plates.In 2007, marine forensic investigators considered that an explosion in the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape from the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, of one sort or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.The original torpedo damage alone, striking the ship on the starboard coal bunker of boiler room no. 1, would probably have sunk the ship without a second explosion. This first blast was enough to cause, on its own, serious off-centre flooding, although the sinking would possibly have been slower. The deficiencies of the ship's original watertight bulkhead design exacerbated the situation, as did the many portholes which had been left open for ventilation.\n\n\n== Wreck site ==\n\nThe wreck of Lusitania lies on her starboard side at an approximately 30-degree angle in 305 feet (93 metres) of sea water. She is severely collapsed onto her starboard side as a result of the force with which she slammed into the sea floor, and over decades, Lusitania has deteriorated significantly faster than Titanic because of the corrosion in the winter tides. The keel has an \"unusual curvature\", in a boomerang shape, which may be related to a lack of strength from the loss of her superstructure. The beam is reduced with the funnels missing presumably to deterioration. The bow is the most prominent portion of the wreck with the stern damaged from depth charging in the Second World War as well as the removal of three of the four propellers by Oceaneering International in 1982 for display.\nSome of the prominent features on Lusitania include her still-legible name, some bollards with the ropes still intact, pieces of the ruined promenade deck, some portholes, the prow and the remaining propeller. Recent expeditions to the wreck have revealed that Lusitania is in surprisingly poor condition compared to Titanic, as her hull has already started to collapse.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList by death toll of ships sunk by submarines\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMedlock, Chelsea Autumn: Lusitania, Sinking of , in: 1914-1918-online.

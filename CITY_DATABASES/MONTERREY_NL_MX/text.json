In 1988 the land was expropriated and the Fideicomiso Fundidora (Fundidora Trust) was created to manage it in an arrangement between the State government and private investment. Construction began in 1989, starting with the preservation of historically important buildings and structures within the foundry and the dismantling of the others, followed by the construction of the CINTERMEX convention center, Plaza Sesamo amusement park, a hotel and a cinematheque. Construction and rehabilitation continued during the rest of the decade of 1990.The park opened in February 24th of 2001 with an area of 114 hectares (280 acres), receiving the additional name of Museum of Industrial Archaeology Site.

        "wiki": "The Museum of Steel, known as the Museo del Acero, is located in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. \nThe Museo del Acero is one of the largest museums ever created in Mexico. It is located on the site of the very large Fundidora steel plant that was decommissioned in the mid 1980s. For 80 years, the Fundidora plant was an important part of the economic and social fabric of this city of 3.7 million people, and its conversion to a major educational facility has been very well received. \nThe new museum, built in and around a decommissioned blast furnace, has emerged as a new focal point for the region   The newly restored 230-foot (70 m)-high blast furnace Horno No. 3, the city\u2019s most recognizable icon dominating the Monterrey skyline, makes the museum unique. The Oficina de Arquitectura partnered with Grimshaw Architects and exhibit designers AldrichPears Associates to create a museum, while preserving its historical character. New galleries include: Gallery of History, Gallery of Steel, The Blast Furnace Show and the Cast Hall.\nThe Museo del Acero opened in the Fundidora Park in the fall of 2007.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nvan Uffelen, Chris (2010).

        "wiki": "The Mirador del Obispado (Bishop\u2019s Lookout) is located at the top of the Cerro del Obispado (Bishop\u2019s Hill) in the northern city of Monterrey, Mexico. It features the biggest bandera monumental (monumental flag) in Mexico. The hill and the lookout receive their name from the building constructed in the middle of the hill by the end of the 18th century, the Palacio del Obispado (Bishop\u2019s Palace).\nAt an altitude of 775 meters above the sea level the lookout consists of a 40 meters of diameter round-shaped esplanade with the flag pole at its center. There are benches, a small parking lot (mainly for handicapped people) and 3 French gardens. The installations are also equipped with restrooms and water troughs. It was conceived as a family walking stroll so the main road is very wide and well illuminated. Cars are allowed to pass but the main parking lot is at the entrance of the Park.\n\n\n== The Bandera Monumental ==\n\nThe country's biggest monumental flag was located at the top of the Cerro del Obispado, in the same place the public scenic lookout is, and it was inaugurated on February 24, 2005 to celebrate the Mexican Flag Day. This flag is currently the second largest in the country. With a pole of 120 tons and 100.6 meters of height and the flag measuring 50 by 28.6 meters and weighing 230 kilograms (this is double the size of most other monumental flags) this place is a very attractive landmark for tourists as well as for locals.Some important days are celebrated with special ceremonies such as the Flag Day, the Independence Day (September 16) and the Army Day; this special ceremonies sometimes include lighting shows, fireworks and artistic performances like regional dances, musicals and concerts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalacio del Obispado\nFamous Places in Monterrey\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMonterrey Monumental Flag space view in Google Earth\nRenewal of the Bishopric Hill by the State Government of Nuevo Leon (in Spanish)",

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda.

          "From all the parks that are available in Monterrey, la Estanzuela is my favorite because it has everything. It is hard for me to believe this place is inside the city. It is really lovely, you can hike in the mountains, swim in a river or spend time in the entrance park",
          "This place is about 20 minutes from Tec de Monterrey and its just a beautiful place. It consist of a loop of about 3 km. If you are an able hiker you can venture into the back country where there are some beautiful small waterfalls of very clear water and you'll find some Coatis",
          "The park closes at 5. We got there just before 3. We didn't realize they cut off the main trail to see the waterfall around that time to make sure people aren't around the park after 5. We didn't know this so we only saw the first part. It was a very nice walkway with a creek on",
          "If you feel like taking a fun hike with amazing views, you should go to La Estanzuela. It's easy to get there and the hike is mostly in the woods, so it's not so hot.",
          "Great to go and take a walk or excersice and has a beautiful small river and views of all the mountines that surround the park",
          "Parque Estanzuela was quite the challenge, but definitely worth it! We have been wanting to check out this place called Parque Estanzuala, apparently a smaller and less commercialized version of Chipinque. We arrived at about 1 pm on Saturday, and it was packed! So much so that",
          "This is the best place in monterrey if you want to go for a quick getaway. You can stay as long as you want but you can do it with 4 hours. Ther's two ways to do it. The path, wich is safe and easy but boring, or you can go up river. Definetly the best and more enjoyable way to",
          "Around 4 km up a country cobblestoned road you reach the entrance and staging area of this nicely kept natural park in south Monterrey. From there you have a \"standard\" 1.5 km trek up the side of a tranquil creek and can take in the beautiful sites that include towering trees",
          "This place is sooo pretty! for some locals unknow also, this is the reason why this place continue so natural! great to talk a walk!",
          "This place is beautiful. Get there early to avoid the crowds. If you are not fit, stay at home or go to Chipinque. You need to hike a lot to get to the waterfalls. To get to the most beautiful one you have to hike for at least 2 hours. There are no signs at all but you only need",
          "It is a park that is half an hour from downtown Monterrey - ideal for walking, exercising and purely enjoying the beautiful natural landscapes. The entrance fee is 20 pesos but I'd recommend going early around 7-8 am to find a free parking lot near the entrance. If you are",
          "With water, snacks, comfortable clothes, towel, a good pair of fresh socks!!! the earlier you get there the better, you may spend at least 4-5 hours there.",
          "If you want a long hike and get a swim in waterfalls and big holes with water, the park is the place for that. It is a very nice place, i enjoyed it a lot with friends. The only negative point is that the first hike part, when it gets very steep, the floor is not adapted for",
          "This park is a great alternative to Chipinque, walk its 5Km in a open nature environment, if you're lucky, you can even take a look at some wildlife like squirrels or bears. You should avoid going on sundays if you want to really enjoy this place.",
          "Keepers and owners should pay more attention to details - put signs on the way to get there - there is no information to get there by car. Signaling!! Not expensive at all and informs visitors. You need to be at the level of this amazing place - dont f**^#} it up!",
          "Like a quiet and nice walking around an oak forest? this is the place!, located just a few minutes from Monterrey down town this is one of the best places to meet with nature! You can do bird and butterfly watching! The palce got restrooms, parking lot, it has a nice walking",
          "It is a lovely natural nature trail through a green valley. It reminded me a bit of a little corner of the English Lake District. There is a stream that runs down the valley. Many butterflies depending on the season. It is some 20 km south of Monterrey city. Be sensible about"

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMonterrey has several neighborhoods. The most populous include:\n\nIndependencia\nCumbres\nObispado\nContry\nMitras Centro, Norte & Sur\nSan Jer\u00f3nimo\nSan Bernab\u00e9\nValle Alto\nDel Paseo\nValle\nCentrito\nLoma Larga\nSan Agustin\nSat\u00e9lite\nVista Hermosa\nAn\u00e1huac\nFlorida\nPrimavera\nModerna\nAlta VistaThe commercial areas include:\n\nCentro\nCarretera Nacional\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.The Monterrey metropolitan area is the third most populous in Mexico with more than 4 million. It comprises the municipalities of Monterrey, Apodaca, Escobedo, Garc\u00eda, Guadalupe, Santiago, Ju\u00e1rez, San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina and Salinas Victoria.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nMonterrey is connected with the United States\u2013Mexico border, the sea and inland Mexico through different roads, including the Carretera Nacional (also known as the Panamerican Highway) that runs from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City and south, and the Carretera Interoce\u00e1nica connecting Matamoros with the port of Mazatl\u00e1n on the Pacific; it is also crossed by highways 40, 45, 57. The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States.\nMonterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 2 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: General Mariano Escobedo International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to key United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.Five airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey, Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. There is no public transportation from Monterrey International Airport to the city. However, the Miguel Aleman highway interchange where public transportation is readily available is approximately 3 kilometers from the airport and can easily be reached on foot.  A cartel of taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo. Inter-city bus services run daily into the interior, as well as north to the US border and points beyond.  \n\n\n=== Health ===\nMonterrey generally has a very highly ranked medical infrastructure with some internationally acclaimed hospitals,\nincluding three with Joint Commission accreditation.\nThe Joint Commission is a private healthcare accreditation group. There are both public and private hospitals. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has two major regional hospitals in the city, the Specialties Regional Hospital # 33, the cardiac centre (Hospital #34), and the Gynecology and Obstetrics Regional Hospital, serving also the northeastern states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Several smaller IMSS hospitals can be found such as the Traumatology and Orthopedics Hospital and the General Hospital # 25. State government owns the Metropolitan Hospital, located in the suburb of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and the Hospital of the Children and Mother Care in Guadalupe suburb.\nThe Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n runs the public University Hospital, with a high-level shock-trauma unit and a specialized clinic for child cancer treatment. It is recognized as the best public hospital in the northeast of Mexico and the UANL School of Medicine as one of the best in the country. On the other hand, the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey runs the Hospital San Jos\u00e9-Tec de Monterrey private hospital.\nMonterrey has healthcare standards above the average for Mexico. It has several hospitals, including Hospital Cima (formerly Santa Engracia) of the International Hospital Corporation. Its convenient location, low prices and quality of medical care have made of Monterrey a very popular medical tourism destination for United States patients.\n\n\n=== Monterrey public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Monterrey, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 85 min. 25% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 min, while 29.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 9.5 km, while 25% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonterrey is a major industrial center in northern Mexico, producing a GDP of 78.5 billion US dollars (2006). The city's GDP per capita in 2010 was 607,042 Mexican pesos or $46,634 US dollars. The city was rated by Fortune magazine in 1999 as the best city in Latin America for business and is currently ranked third best by the Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda magazine.The city has prominent positions in sectors such as steel, cement, glass, auto parts, and brewing. The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.Industrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey, a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services). The FEMSA corporation owned a large brewery, the Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery (Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma) that produces the brands Sol, Tecate, Indio, Dos Equis and Carta Blanca among others, in the beginning of the year Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery was sold to Dutch-based company Heineken. By the end of the same year, there were more than 13,000 manufacturing companies, 55,000 retail stores, and more than 52,000 service firms in Monterrey.The metals sector, dominated by iron and steel, accounted for 6 percent of manufacturing GNP in 1994. Mexico's steel industry is centered in Monterrey, where the country's first steel mills opened in 1903. Steel processing plants in Monterrey, privatized in 1986, accounted for about half of Mexico's total steel output in the early 1990s.Monterrey was ranked 94th worldwide and fifth in Latin America in terms of Quality of Life according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2006), and was ranked second in 2005 and fourth in 2006, according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda.\nSome of the shopping malls in the city include Paseo San Pedro, Paseo La Fe, Plaza Fiesta San Agust\u00edn, Galer\u00edas Monterrey, and Galer\u00edas Valle Oriente, which distribute goods and services to the Mexican population.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMonterrey has an estimated 3.7% rate of illiteracy. In 2005, of an estimated 983,359 inhabitants above 6 years of age, 36,689 were illiterate.In 2005, the city had 72 public libraries, with 298,207 books available, serving an estimated 478,047 readers.The Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n (Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, UANL) is the third-largest Mexican university and is ranked by the Reader's Digest-AC Nielsen Survey 2005 as the top public university in northeast Mexico. Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria (University City), covers approximately 67,630,000 square metres (17,000 acres). The UANL system comprises 26 colleges (faculties), 22 graduate divisions, 24 high schools, 1 center of bilingual education and 3 technical high schools. Its medical school is considered one of the most advanced in Latin America.Monterrey is also the headquarters of the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies), which ranked #291 at the 2013 QS World University Rankings in Engineering and Information Technology, #201 in Social Sciences and #279 overall. It also holds a \"QS Stars Rated for Excellence\" of 5 stars.\nThe Universidad Regiomontana was founded in 1969 with the support of local leading multinational corporations such as Cemex, Alfa, Femsa, Gamesa, Protexa and CYDSA. It is a private educational institution offering university-preparatory school, undergraduate and graduate programs. It has agreements with more than 350 universities across the globe (such as the recent expanded agreement with Texas A&M International University). It is member of GATE (Global Alliance for Transnational Education) and FIMPES (Federaci\u00f3n de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educaci\u00f3n Superior) and its administration holds an ISO 9001 Certification. The university is nationally recognized, so its degree equivalency is comparable to that of a regionally accredited university in the United States. The university is dedicated to educating students in an atmosphere of freedom and humanism, and providing students hands-on experience in their field of study. Its urban campus further stimulates the city\u2019s vibrant economy and attracts working professionals who complement and enrich the academic experience.\nThe Universidad de Monterrey was founded by the religious congregations of the Sisters of Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe, the nuns of the Sacred Heart and the Marist and La Salle brothers, all of them supported by an association of Catholic citizens. In December 2001 it was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to deliver bachelor and master level educational programs.\nMonterrey also practices Model United Nations. The most popular conferences at the high school level are MUNterrey, UdeMUN and IMMUNS. The activity started developing in the city in the late 1990s due to American influence. It is now practiced in most private schools. Some of the reasons Model UN is very popular among schools are English speaking, public speaking and international affairs.\nThe city is home to the Monterrey College of Music and Dance, which offers degrees in performing arts.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe most traditional dish from Monterrey is cabrito, kid goat cooked on embers. Other local dishes and customs that perhaps date back to the Crypto-Judaism of Monterrey's founding families are the \"semita\" (bread without leavening), the capirotada dessert (a mix of cooked bread, cheese, raisins, peanuts, and crystallized sugarcane juice), and the relative absence of pork dishes. Another famous local dish is machacado con huevo.\nCarne asada on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and sausages or chopped as tacos. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. \"Glorias\" and \"obleas,\" made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo Le\u00f3n desserts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMonterrey has two football teams in the Mexican league. The C.F. Monterrey, commonly known as the Rayados del Monterrey, uses the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, a facility sponsored by BBVA Bancomer and other important businesses. The Tigres UANL, owned by CEMEX, host matches at Estadio Universitario, on the main campus of the UANL. Both teams are related to the city on the derby, called Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano. During the match, most of the city watches in bars, clubs, and family homes. It was proposed to build a stadium for both teams, the \"Estadio Internacional Monterrey\", but both teams rejected the idea. The project is still being promoted, but the UANL Tigres have yet to finish their stadium contract and the Rayados just inaugurated a new stadium of their own. Club de F\u00fatbol Monterrey recently opened a new stadium with a capacity of 50,000.

        "wiki": "Faro del Comercio is a monument designed by the accomplished Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n and constructed in 1984 by architect Ra\u00fal Ferrera. It is a recognizable sight in Monterrey among many other modern manmade landmarks, such as Neptune's Fountain (Fuente de la Vida), the Monterrey City Hall, the Papal Bridge (El Puente del Papa), and the Bridge of Unity (Puente de la Unidad) in San Pedro, connecting that municipality to Monterrey. These sites are intended on one hand to complement the city's few remaining traditional landmarks, such as, the Bishopric Palace (Palacio del Obispado) and Museum, the City's Cathedral (Catedral Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey), the Central Post Office (old Monterrey City Hall), and the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n Government building, on the north end of the Macroplaza.  On the other hand, they are also intended to project an image of a city that prides itself as being the most progressive large industrial city of Mexico.\n\nEl Faro del Comercio was built in commemoration of the founding of the Chamber of Commerce of Monterrey's on its 100-year anniversary. It is located near the south end of the Macroplaza facing the City's Cathedral and behind the new Monterrey City Hall. El Faro del Comercio is 69.80 meters tall and 12.33 meters wide. Its bright reddish-orange color attracts attention when visiting the Macroplaza, Monterrey's central park.\nAt nights, the landmark frequently projects a rotating green spotlight which interrupts the city's night sky with its beam in a somewhat random cycle in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey.  Recently (2007), many large reflecting white spotlights from the nearby Museum of Mexican History Museo de Historia Mexicana and Santa Lucia Riverwalk, and around the Bishopric Hill where in 2005 the largest Mexican flag was installed (Banderas monumentales) and flown at night, as well as from high-power reflectors of many commercial establishments, clash randomly in the sky, visible from most locations in Monterrey and the surrounding areas.\nAfter failing or being \"out of commission\" for several years due to an impractical technical laser mechanism which intended to have three colored lasers and a much greater visual impact on the dark skies of the surrounding areas, some of the original mechanism was salvaged and partially replaced and redesigned to have some operational ability with the green color.  The redesign has some success since green is the color for which the eye is most sensitive and allows the perception of more light for the power limitations.  However, the new design falls far short of the original claims for the construction. The structure was repainted after the laser renovation and reinaugurated at the 196th Independence Day Anniversary celebration on September 16, 2006.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotograph",

        "wiki": "S\u00e9samo (English: Sesame), formerly titled Plaza S\u00e9samo (English: Sesame Street) prior to 2016, is one of the first international co-productions of the American children's television program Sesame Street.  Its first season premiered in Mexico in 1972, and the last season ended in 2018 during the holiday season and the 50th anniversary of Sesame Street, but the show returned in 2020 and was immediately a ratings hit.  It also aired throughout Latin America, to a potential audience of 25 million children in 34 countries.  Unlike some of the earliest co-productions, which consisted of dubbed versions of Sesame Street with local language voice-overs, S\u00e9samo was a true co-production.  Half of the show was adapted from the American show, and half was original material, created in Mexico by Mexican writers, performers, and producers.  The first season consisted of 130 half-hour episodes.  The Plaza S\u00e8samo  development process was similar to that of the American show. Its goals were developed by local experts in television, child development, and early education during curriculum seminars in Caracas, Venezuela.  S\u00e9samo's goals emphasized problem solving and reasoning, and also included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child's environment.  Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions.  Early reading skills were taught through the whole language method.  The show's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.\nThe show's set consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region.  New Muppets and human characters were created.  In all, four seasons of S\u00e9samo were filmed.  The first season resulted in some of the highest ratings in Mexico.  The fourth season, filmed in 1995, was broadcast in the U.S., making it the first foreign-language co-production shown in the U.S.  Studies conducted after the first season of S\u00e9samo showed that it had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience.  Highly significant difference were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show.  Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show.  Characters from the show participated in campaigns promoting health and nutrition; in 2009, the Sesame Workshop, the organization responsible for the American show, was awarded the \"Champion of Health\" award by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for its efforts.\nSesame Amigos, a Sesame Workshop production for Spanish-speakers from the United States, debuted in 2015. This series aired Saturday mornings on Univision as part of their Planeta U block until October 2017 when it was replaced by Calimero.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA few months after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, producers from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop, or \"the Workshop\"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries.  Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, \"To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created\".  She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries.  By summer 1970, he had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call \"co-productions\".\n\nAs of 2006, there were 20 active co-productions.  In 2000, CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.  Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co-productions accounted for US$96 million in 1994. Cole stated, \"Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world\".  Most of the early international versions were what Cole called \"fairly simple\", consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways.  Studies conducted on the effects of several co-productions found that viewers of these shows gain basic skills from watching them.\n\n\n== Production ==\n Plaza S\u00e9samo debuted in Mexico on the Televisa network in 1972.  According to Sesame Street producer Gregory J. Gettas, Plazo S\u00e9samo was one of Sesame Street's first true co-productions, programs that were developed using a variant of a flexible model, called the CTW model, created by the producers and creators of the American show, in the countries they aired.  Like the American show in the late 1960s, the producers and researchers in Mexico conducted a curriculum seminar in Caracas, Venezuela.  The goals they developed, however, were significantly different than the goals developed in the U.S.  For example, the Plaza S\u00e9samo team emphasized problem solving and reasoning.  Their educational goals included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child's environment.  Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions.  The show was designed to address the educational needs of the region's 25 million children in 34 countries, including its target audience of 7 million children between the ages of 3 and 6 in Mexico alone.  Despite their common language, the show's Latin American viewers had a wide variety of customs and lifestyles.  The show's budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.The American-produced and dubbed segments were analyzed for cultural appropriateness.  If any segments were considered \"too American\", meaning that they contained English writing on the screen, showed the American flag, or overtly referred to American history, they were removed.  The board was responsible for choosing content from the CTW's inventory, and it had to satisfy the curriculum goals chosen by the Latin American researchers.  They chose to teach reading through the whole language method, which emphasizes teaching children to recognize entire words or phrases, as opposed to phonetics, the way the American show taught reading.  The Mexican producers and writers designed a distinctive set that appeared different than the American set and consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region.  The set included a background of mountains, a vacant lot with playground equipment, houses, a combination repair shop and store-cafe, and the plaza's central fountain and benches.  New music, written and performed by Latin American artists, was recorded, and writers and performers from Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela, were hired.\n\nNew Muppet characters were created and performed by puppeteers trained in Mexico City.  Abelardo, a giant parrot, was modeled after the American show's Big Bird, and like Big Bird, was a full-body puppet that was controlled by the puppeteer from inside the costume.  Paco, a grouchy green parrot, was based on Oscar the Grouch.  Abelardo and Paco were both played by Justo Martinez.  The Muppets Beto and Enrique, who were based upon Bert and Ernie of the American show, were called  \"national favorites\" by the UPI less than three years after the show's premiere.  In 1975, Enrique and Beto were used to promote Mexico's nationwide free vaccination campaign.130 half-hour episodes of the show's first season were shot in Mexico City entirely in Spanish, under the control of a Mexican research and production team.  About half the show's material was adapted from the American show and dubbed into Spanish, while the other half was produced in Mexico and included animation, live-action films, and studio sequences with human actors and Muppets.  A Mexican board of advisers, who set curriculum goals for the show, approved all content, both Mexican and American, something that followed the newly established policies of the CTW.  Mexican psychologist Rogelio Diaz-Guerrero was the first chair of the show's advisory board, which was later expanded to include child-development and educators from other Latin American countries, so that Plazo S\u00e9samo could be broadcast throughout Central and South America, including the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.The third season, which was filmed in 1983 and consisted of 130 half-hour episodes, had different goals than the previous seasons.  One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, \"a matter of critical importance in an area of the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high\".  The third season of the show included characters created to \"expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models\".  The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities.  They cast performers in two different families.  The first family was more traditional and consisted of a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children.  The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home.  Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.  As of 1990, the third season was still airing in reruns.In 1995, a fourth season of Plaza S\u00e9samo was produced.  It featured two monsters named Lola and Pancho, a larger cast of children, more original music, and a new set designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta.  The season focused on a more innovative curriculum, developed by a board of Latin American educators and UNICEF, and included topics such as health, hygiene, safety issues, cooperation, counting, and the alphabet.  The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, for the purpose of promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children's first teachers.  The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; it was the first time an original co-production was shown in the U.S.  As Gary Knell, an executive at the CTW stated, \"Our mission is to educate all kids.  And the fact is, in the U.S., especially in cities like Los Angeles, there's an enormous number of Spanish-speaking households\".The fourth season was test-marketed for American audiences in April on PBS and Univision stations in Miami, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and Los Angeles.  The test-run was successful, so PBS and Univision began airing it nationally in December; it reached 92% of the country's Spanish-speaking households.  At first, Plaza S\u00e9samo's producers were concerned that the show would be attacked, but The Los Angeles Times reported that \"even some staunch opponents of bilingual education concede that Plaza S\u00e9samo has its merits\".  The L.A. Times also stated that its broadcast in the U.S. was an acknowledgment that Spanish was a prominent language in the U.S. and that more children were bilingual.  The show's supporters believed that exposure to an educational program like Plaza S\u00e9samo would result in the transfer of Spanish skills to English and increase literacy in both languages.  Bilingual education opponents disagreed, but were not against the show's entertainment value.  According to Knell, the CTW found that watching the Spanish version did not draw children away from the English version.In 2012, Plaza S\u00e9samo celebrated its 40th anniversary with the creation of a new website and a traveling photo exhibit.  In December 2013, the show's 15th season premiered with 52 episodes.  Segments were shot throughout Latin America; it was the first time the show was filmed in Colombia.  Its curriculum focused on math, literacy, diversity, and health.  A stakeholders meeting was convened in Bogot\u00e1 in October 2012, consisting of interested parties from government and the private sector, and included officials from UNICEF.In 2016, episodes began to debut on HBO Latino, as part of a five year deal running from January 16, 2016 - July 11, 2020. All songs are left undubbed from English\nThat same year, Plaza S\u00e9samo shortened its name to simply S\u00e9samo. Three seasons have been produced as of December 2017, with a total of 65 episodes.\nA fourth season, made exclusively for Azteca 7 debuted on April 27, 2020. The season mostly features dubbed segments from Season 50 of its American counterpart.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nWhen Plaza S\u00e9samos's first season premiered, it was the highest rated TV program ever broadcast in Mexico.  The UPI reported that all three seasons of the show had some of the highest ratings in Mexico; its second season, which premiered in 1975, \"had piled on ratings that only Mexico's popular soap operas could rival\".  Gettas claimed that Plaza S\u00e9samo was \"the model for all subsequent Sesame Street co-productions throughout the world\".  He also stated that the first season \"had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience\".  In 1974, a study was conducted by American and Mexican researchers that studied the effect of Plaza S\u00e9samo on its viewers.  Highly significant differences were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show.  Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show.Seasons 1-48 and clips from Sesame Street were dubbed into Mexican (Latin American) Spanish, but Seasons 10, 13, 15, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48 of Sesame Street on HBO were redubbed, but Seasons 49-50 of Sesame Street from HBO were dubbed.\n\nIn 1995, Parque Plaza S\u00e9samo, a 12-acre theme park based on the show, was opened in Monterrey, Mexico, within the gates of the theme park Parque Fundidora.  It is the first theme park of its kind in Mexico.  According to a press release announcing its opening, Parque Plaza S\u00e9samo includes water rides, live entertainment, interactive, and educational elements.  It is privately owned, with Mexican investments, and features the show's characters, along with the American Sesame Street, via a licensing agreement with Sesame Workshop. The park's focus audience is around northern Mexico and South Texas.In 2003, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Sesame Workshop collaborated in a program promoting vaccinations.  Their promotion reached over 147 million children and adults.  In 2007, the Workshop participated in an extensive health promotion in Mexico; they put many of the characters of Plaza S\u00e9samo on milk containers, which were given to schools, with positive messages about nutrition and exercise.  Studies showed that the promotion was effective.  Children choose healthy food associated with the show's characters, and 68 percent of families exposed to the promotion reported positive changes in their children's nutrition and hygiene habits.  In 2009, the Workshop was awarded the \"Champion of Health\" award by PAHO for its efforts. In response to a flu pandemic in Mexico, various national celebrities appeared in public service announcements with the Plaza Muppets, discussing flu prevention.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n1997; 2017; 2020: \"Sesame Street\" (Episode 3646; 5025, The Magical Wand Chase, with Abelardo Montoya as Big Bird's cousin)\n2002: \"The 76th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\" (with Abelardo Montoya and Lola) (November 28)\n2011-13: Sesame Street Road Safety Campaign (with Pancho)\n2013-17: \"\u00a1Despierta Am\u00e9rica!\"; \"Dream, Save, Do\" (with Lola)\n\n\n=== Events ===\n2003: Sesame Workshop's Annual Benefit Gala (June 4)\n2019: Sesame Street: Road Trip with Abelardo Montoya as Big Bird's cousin as he travels from Mexico to Los Angeles, for material taped for season 50.)\n\n\n=== Comic Books ===\n2013: \"Sesame Street\": (Issue #1, with Bodoque)\n\n\n== International broadcasting ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCole, Charlotte F.; Beth A.

Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMonterrey has several neighborhoods. The most populous include:\n\nIndependencia\nCumbres\nObispado\nContry\nMitras Centro, Norte & Sur\nSan Jer\u00f3nimo\nSan Bernab\u00e9\nValle Alto\nDel Paseo\nValle\nCentrito\nLoma Larga\nSan Agustin\nSat\u00e9lite\nVista Hermosa\nAn\u00e1huac\nFlorida\nPrimavera\nModerna\nAlta VistaThe commercial areas include:\n\nCentro\nCarretera Nacional\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.The Monterrey metropolitan area is the third most populous in Mexico with more than 4 million.

The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States.\nMonterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 2 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: General Mariano Escobedo International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to key United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.Five airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey, Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. There is no public transportation from Monterrey International Airport to the city. However, the Miguel Aleman highway interchange where public transportation is readily available is approximately 3 kilometers from the airport and can easily be reached on foot.  A cartel of taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo. Inter-city bus services run daily into the interior, as well as north to the US border and points beyond.  \n\n\n=== Health ===\nMonterrey generally has a very highly ranked medical infrastructure with some internationally acclaimed hospitals,\nincluding three with Joint Commission accreditation.\nThe Joint Commission is a private healthcare accreditation group.

The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.Industrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey, a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services). The FEMSA corporation owned a large brewery, the Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery (Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma) that produces the brands Sol, Tecate, Indio, Dos Equis and Carta Blanca among others, in the beginning of the year Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery was sold to Dutch-based company Heineken. By the end of the same year, there were more than 13,000 manufacturing companies, 55,000 retail stores, and more than 52,000 service firms in Monterrey.The metals sector, dominated by iron and steel, accounted for 6 percent of manufacturing GNP in 1994. Mexico's steel industry is centered in Monterrey, where the country's first steel mills opened in 1903. Steel processing plants in Monterrey, privatized in 1986, accounted for about half of Mexico's total steel output in the early 1990s.Monterrey was ranked 94th worldwide and fifth in Latin America in terms of Quality of Life according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2006), and was ranked second in 2005 and fourth in 2006, according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda.\nSome of the shopping malls in the city include Paseo San Pedro, Paseo La Fe, Plaza Fiesta San Agust\u00edn, Galer\u00edas Monterrey, and Galer\u00edas Valle Oriente, which distribute goods and services to the Mexican population.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMonterrey has an estimated 3.7% rate of illiteracy.

Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria (University City), covers approximately 67,630,000 square metres (17,000 acres). The UANL system comprises 26 colleges (faculties), 22 graduate divisions, 24 high schools, 1 center of bilingual education and 3 technical high schools. Its medical school is considered one of the most advanced in Latin America.Monterrey is also the headquarters of the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies), which ranked #291 at the 2013 QS World University Rankings in Engineering and Information Technology, #201 in Social Sciences and #279 overall. It also holds a \"QS Stars Rated for Excellence\" of 5 stars.\nThe Universidad Regiomontana was founded in 1969 with the support of local leading multinational corporations such as Cemex, Alfa, Femsa, Gamesa, Protexa and CYDSA. It is a private educational institution offering university-preparatory school, undergraduate and graduate programs. It has agreements with more than 350 universities across the globe (such as the recent expanded agreement with Texas A&M International University). It is member of GATE (Global Alliance for Transnational Education) and FIMPES (Federaci\u00f3n de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educaci\u00f3n Superior) and its administration holds an ISO 9001 Certification. The university is nationally recognized, so its degree equivalency is comparable to that of a regionally accredited university in the United States. The university is dedicated to educating students in an atmosphere of freedom and humanism, and providing students hands-on experience in their field of study. Its urban campus further stimulates the city\u2019s vibrant economy and attracts working professionals who complement and enrich the academic experience.\nThe Universidad de Monterrey was founded by the religious congregations of the Sisters of Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe, the nuns of the Sacred Heart and the Marist and La Salle brothers, all of them supported by an association of Catholic citizens.

The most popular conferences at the high school level are MUNterrey, UdeMUN and IMMUNS. The activity started developing in the city in the late 1990s due to American influence. It is now practiced in most private schools. Some of the reasons Model UN is very popular among schools are English speaking, public speaking and international affairs.\nThe city is home to the Monterrey College of Music and Dance, which offers degrees in performing arts.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nThe most traditional dish from Monterrey is cabrito, kid goat cooked on embers. Other local dishes and customs that perhaps date back to the Crypto-Judaism of Monterrey's founding families are the \"semita\" (bread without leavening), the capirotada dessert (a mix of cooked bread, cheese, raisins, peanuts, and crystallized sugarcane juice), and the relative absence of pork dishes. Another famous local dish is machacado con huevo.\nCarne asada on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and sausages or chopped as tacos. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. \"Glorias\" and \"obleas,\" made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo Le\u00f3n desserts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMonterrey has two football teams in the Mexican league. The C.F. Monterrey, commonly known as the Rayados del Monterrey, uses the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, a facility sponsored by BBVA Bancomer and other important businesses. The Tigres UANL, owned by CEMEX, host matches at Estadio Universitario, on the main campus of the UANL. Both teams are related to the city on the derby, called Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano. During the match, most of the city watches in bars, clubs, and family homes. It was proposed to build a stadium for both teams, the \"Estadio Internacional Monterrey\", but both teams rejected the idea. The project is still being promoted, but the UANL Tigres have yet to finish their stadium contract and the Rayados just inaugurated a new stadium of their own. Club de F\u00fatbol Monterrey recently opened a new stadium with a capacity of 50,000. It was scheduled to be finished by 2014, named \"Estadio de F\u00fatbol Monterrey\", but was inaugurated on August 2, 2015, in a match with the Benfica FC. Rayados won, 3-0. Before the inauguration, the name was changed to Estadio BBVA Bancomer. It will remain the club's property for 50 years before becoming government property.

The outer buildings of the palace became a museum in 1914, although the imperial family continued to live in the private apartments until 1924. In 1925, after the former emperor Puyi of the Qing dynasty was moved out, the Palace Museum was formally established. Many of the halls surrounding the museum are presented as they would have appeared in dynastic times. The main buildings of the museum include the Hall of Supreme Harmony, one of the largest wooden buildings in China. The Hall of Preserving Harmony displays a fine collection of works of art, many from the imperial treasures. Among the more impressive works is a 14-metre- (47-foot-) long Yuan fresco that was taken from the Xinghua Temple. Other areas of the palace contain displays of bronzes, sculptures, pottery and porcelain, jade, and silks. Some of the treasures are exhibited in the northeast corner of the palace, known as the Palace of Peace and Longevity. These include priceless objects of precious metals and jewels and some examples of the 3,000 pieces that formed the imperial tableware.Some of the treasures formerly stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing were shipped by the Nationalist government to Taiwan before 1949 and are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

        "wiki": "Grutas de Garc\u00eda (Garcia Caves) is a cave complex located 9 km outside Garc\u00eda, Nuevo Le\u00f3n in northern Mexico about 30 km from Monterrey. The caves are inside Sierra del Fraile mountain and protected area. The easiest way to reach the entrance to the caves is by taking a five-minute ride on the aerial tramway, but there is a steep path that can be taken to reach the caves.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe caves are thought to have formed between 50 and 60 million years ago. During the prehistoric era, the caves were submerged in sea water, and that is the reason marine fossils like sea shells and snail shells can be seen on the cave walls. Grutas de Garc\u00eda remained hidden for thousands of years until 1843. Priest  Juan Antonio Sobrevilla discovered the caves during a casual excursion through the mountains.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe caves inside look like a rocky desert landscape with a longitude of 300 meters and 105 meters deep. From the entrance two different paths emerge descending 105 meters: one is about 2.5 kilometers and has 16 different chambers; the other is 1 kilometer long with 11 chambers. Like most caves these maintain a temperature around 18 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F).Inside the caves impressive rock formations are observed that fill the space in the large chambers. There are many interesting stalagmites and stalactites. \nOne of the most spectacular chambers is known as \u201cEl sal\u00f3n de la luz\u201d (The Light Chamber) named because of the natural clarity of the rock on the ceiling allowing light from outside to filter through.  \u201cLa octava maravilla\u201d (The Eighth Wonder) is a formation in the cave where a stalagmite connected with a stalactite to form a column.  \u201cEl sal\u00f3n del aire\u201d (The Air Chamber) exhibits a balcony that is 40 meters high.\n\u201cEl mirador de la mano\u201d, is a stalagmite that formed a shape that resembles a human hand. There are numerous other formations that are fascinating like: \u201cEl Nacimiento\u201d (The Nativity), \u201cLa Fuente Congelada\u201d (The Frozen Fountain), \"La Torre China\u201d (The Chinese Tower), \u201cEl teatro\u201d (The Theatre), and \u201cEl \u00c1rbol de Navidad\u201d (The Christmas Tree).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of caves in Mexico\n\n\n== References ==",

Booked a tour with \u2018toursionterrey\u2019. $800 pesos per person and they gave me a $200\u2019pesos discount as I booked multiple tours.

          "A tour for the decades. And I say this because I have had the opportunity to visit since I was 8 now 38 and the only thing that has changed is the way up to the cave. Although the new maybe safer cable car is more modern I did have a preference for the old train going up the",
          "This was as nice a cave as Carlsbad, NM. It helps if you know Spanish because I didn't know any. I was stuck in Monterey and this is one of two places I visited. You begin on a cable car ride. You look up and see this isn't you typical ride, it's high, all the way to the top",

          "Went in a large group and got a tour into the cavern. Learned a lot about the minerals and the age of the formations. Also learned that there are sea shells in parts of the cavern floor.",

          "Amazing place to see the nature action over the years into the caves, you would be willing to walk around taking stairs to admire the nature scenes",
          "Just went with my family from other contry who came to visit, we read about facilities for elderly and young children, but end up waiting for 3 hrs under the sun for the one and only \"teleferico\" to take us up. You can get there walking but it's mostly a hiking situation and",
          "Definitely a must see and the photos don't do this place justice. There is a lot of up and down stairs throughout this cave, so not recommended if stairs are not your forte. Entrance fee including cable car up the mountain was 50 pesos each, sounder 5$... OR you can walk up the",
          "First above all else, bring comfy walking shoes. My husband and I were in complete awe of this place. The in\u2019s and outs of this place were stunning. And then the view outside,Unforgettable!",

          "We took a weekend trip to Monterrey and had discovered this place before traveling. Rented a car from the airport and headed there right after landing. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and friendly. This view from atop the mountain is beautiful and the cable car experience",
          "We arrived at 9:30 am. There was hardly anyone there. It was the perfect time to arrive. We were the first group to go upon the cable car. Once we arrived to the top we were able to enjoy the beautiful view. Then we went inside the mountain to the caves. We had a tour",
          "The caves are interesting but getting there is not easy , it\u2019s far , there is so much traffic to get out of the city in that area . The telef\u00e9rico does not always work , and honestly It\u2019s too much hassle to make the visit . The caves are fine but it\u2019s not like there are that",
          "These caves are the perfect attraction if you love nature, long walks and mountains. Ideal for a family trip, not really far away from town (a bit less than an hour).",
          "Take the cable car or hike to get up there. They are impressive and the tour is very well guided and explained",
          "The Grutas de Garcia are something visitors to the Monterrey area should make an effort to get out and visit. Not only does the teleferico offer visitors stunning mountain vistas, but as soon as you enter the caves themselves, you're in for an unbelievable treat. Incredibly",
          "Cable cart up the top, beautiful views. Caves; Caves are very interesting. Rock formations that are 'shaped' like things. An area with coloured changing lights. A rock formation with lights around it, to resemble a christmas tree....Interesting. Steps can be dangerous when",
          "The grutas are not the biggest you'll ever see but they are still impressive. The tour guides give something really good information. Sometimes the lighting feels cheap and ruins the naturalness of the tour but overall it's a nice surprise close to the city. The cable car is not",
          "My 70 year old mother, my 2 Girls (age 4 and 5), and the wife and I went and we all did the steps with no issues. If you feel like you are running out of breath, you can slow down and let the tour guide go ahead and you take your time. We had an excellent time, it was nice to",
          "Pictures don\u2019t do this amazing place justice. You have to see it for yourself. This place is super spiritual and very education. Most of the museum is in both Spanish and English so it enjoyable for everyone. The caves are amazing to see...",

          "If you are in town and you have a couple of spare hours you might consider to visit this places. It is just 40 minutes away from downtown and it\u2019s a pretty cool place to visit. Something to take in consideration is that the grutas are close after 4pm so you should go early in",

          "These are really just stalactites, stalagmites and a lot of rock formations but they were able to make them interesting by setting up various showcase spots. Make sure you bring a good camera that can capture low light situations to get nice pictures. I came in on a morning and",

We arrived at 9:20 and took the first aerial tramway to the mountain at 10am (I suppose they",

This is not a light trail and I don\u2019t recommend it if you are not used to hiking in the heat. The view was magnificent but unfortunately we didn\u2019t make it to the",
          "A must in your visit to Monterrey, I'll be honest though, it's a one time trip. And while you're there, go to the Zoo. It's pretty neat and just next the Garcia entrance. Just a couple of minutes outside of Monterrey. Make sure to take the cable car up the mountain if you're not",
          "It is a very nice location close to Monterrey, if you are up for a nice walk and some fresh air this is it. The caves are amazing how ever is a long walk, 45 minutes to 60 minutes, ups and downs on stairs, If you are planing to go with toddlers just make sure that you are in a",
          "Excellent place to visit when in Monterrey. Not too far from the city. The caves are in the high part of a mountain, so you have to take a cableway with amazing view to get to the entrance. Brace for a lot of stairs.",

          "We went on a Friday to the caves. It was about 45 minutes to drive from Monterrey city center. Getting there is beautiful as it's at the end of a gorgeous set of mountains. It was very quiet as it was Friday during the day, but that was a plus. We took the cable car up the",
          "A lil drive from the center of the city but worth it. I've been to a few caves before and this is definitely a cool spot to visit and fun when traveling with kids and teenagers.",
          "This has to be a-must in your visit to Monterrey, is a Natural spectacular visit, even is a lots of stairs is not difficult the guide make it slow enough for everyone in the group to enjoy and take pictures.",
          "It was a good trip, we reached there pretty early to avoid lot of crowd on a Sunday. There is a trail that you can take to hike up or a cable car. It was too sunny to hike up then, but should be a good hike. The cable car ride is nice and you literally feel the sight below",
          "Even though it is not officially present as the Games of Thrones dragon head, I can tell you I saw one, I even have a picture :) you can go with the cabin or walk. I took the sunny walk back, prepare for a hot walk and a bumpy road, make sure to have appropriate shoes. The cave",
          "What n amazing place - even to get there is an adventure as you have to take the cable car to get to the top, and then access the caves themselves. I have been to many limestone caves and these are some of the best. Excellent pathways, gantries and boardwalks throughout.",
          "Grutas de Garcia is maybe one of the top attractions in Monterrey. Located some 30Km from downtown, they offer guided visits. Even when Monyterrey is a very warm city, temperature inside the cave is always fresh. You can get to the grottoes in a cableway or by foot. You should",
          "It is a nice venue for tourists. About $80 pesos or$50 pesos if you prefer to hike it up the mountain without using trailcar. Inside of cave temperature is a little cooler but be warned there are al lot of stairs to walk throughout the tour. No English translation! Highly",
          "I had not visited the caves in about 5 years. Ever since the park around them has been improved. But the inside of the caves is in need of attention. It was shameful to see the Christmas tree ( somebody please do something about that). It takes a very long drive to get there.",
          "The caves are a bit far out but definitely worth a visit.The caves are very beautiful and special. They have lighted up several areas in the cave so you can see all the details of the special walls. There are a lot of paths through the caves and it is very easy to walk around so",
          "It is very nice, beautiful and awe-inspiring.....the first time you visit. Second time it might be a bit boring. My suggestion is to take a guided tour, they are not expensive. You might take your lunch, or buy something outside the grutas, they sell chips, ice cream, hotdogs,",
          "You would think only in United States they had such beauty. These caverns are very beautiful. To get to the top of this entrance you would have to take an electric cable cart.This place is nice to take with family or just as a couple as they talk to you a little about the",
          "While the 'grutas' may be bit far off, they are surely worth your time. Once there, you can either take a lift up the mountain or hike up the mountain along a zig-zap paved path which I was told can take up to an hour to walk up or if you are 'elite' you can make it in 25 mins",
          "I went there with my wife and another family. We had a child and it was safe for us and for the child too. First, we took uber, we didn't know that the road has taxes to pay to go to gracia, we paid 2 times each way, the first time was about 48 pesos, the second time was a more",
          "The caves are gorgeous... a natural place with history. The guide is full of interesting information.",
          "We took an Uber from Apodaca. The journey was about an hour and there were 2 road tolls along the way (paid about 200 pesos for the tolls). There were some stalls selling snacks,beverages and crafts near the ticket counter. The tickets to enter the Grutas via the cable ride",
          "Well, what can I say. It's a cave. But I find it to be more interesting than many others. The view from the top of the cable car is amazing. Worth visit even for that. The cave itself is lit nicely and you can find some fossils in the stone. Possible also walk up the mountain.",
          "Definitely worth the drive and really cheap to get in. We rented a car and parked with no problem, it was $80 pesos to take the cart up (they did stuff it with way too many people though). Once you get to the top (which you can also hike up to for $50 pesos) the views are",
          "A scenic but short tram ride up the steep hill to the entrance of the cave. There's a path if you wish to walk up or down. The tour takes about 45 minutes, guides are helpful and personable. The cave is easy to find, just west of Monterrey outside of Garcia - signs direct the",
          "I swore I would never ride a gondola because I am afraid of heights, but this ride up to the cave entrance was not bad at all. This cave was amazing. I had read about caves prior to my visit, which was good because I could understand only a few of the words of the",
          "Very windy the day we visited. So much so that they closed the gondola down. It was a .9 mile hike with 1000 ft of elevation change - thanks to my Fitbit. Many people were unprepared for the hike. Wear sensible shoes as you may be walking down. The tour was great and the",
          "The Caves of Garcia (Grutas de Garcia) are an amazing experience. They are about 45 minutes outside of Monterrey, and easy to reach by car. There is free parking, and then you ride a cable car (Teleferico) up the side of the mountain to the caves. The tour consists of a paved",

          "Desertic area near Municipio de Garcia. It's far away the city soy it is good to arrange a round trip from the city. Don't rely on uber for your return. Good fare for a taxi would be arround MEX$1100 and the driver it's going to wait for you there. For a tour you have to arrange",
          "going up on the mono lift besides the mountain, after ten minute trip you start your walk inside the mountain, all over the natural caverns, you need to have good activity condition, you have to go through more than 700 stairs so be ware of the condition",
          "These caves have amazing marble formations with 50 meters tall columns and some strange figures that let your imagination fly. In my Top 5 in the world, I regret being so many times in Monterrey without visiting them. This caves are located about 45 minutes from Monterrey/ San",
          "I've been to many caves but these are really impressive and well maintained. The tour is in Spanish but still worth going. It takes about an hour and there are stairs to climb but my 70 year old mom was able to do it. We road the lift up to the entrance and it was safe and",
          "We visited with s group of friends. Very young and very old. It was a nice day. The cave is nice. For the younger folks the walk up is great. For the older ones the ride up is a good option.",
          "These are stunning caves with a size that you won't believe. The cable car ride to the top is a nice experience - like skiing without snow. Having a guide is not optional - though he seemed most impressed with the animal or human shapes that the rocks formed, than really",
          "If you visit Monterrey you must go Grutas, it ios about 40 minutes from Downtown but it worth go. Besides, you can visit a Zoo on the way",
          "The place is very well conserved and clean. Everyone is very polite and kind. The tour in the grutas is simply amazing and very well explained by the tour guides. VERY RECOMMENDED.",
          "We visited here in 2007. I was unaware of Trip Advisor at that time. Very inexpensive and not located to far away from Monterey. Great place for kids and families. The cable car ride to the top of the mountain is awesome!!! Very beautiful and interesting caves!!! Great and",

          "First i was sceptical if i need to go to this place but i got my self ready on weekend and visited it. Few things to note -Dont rely on taxi / uber as your visit will be around 4 hours. Better book a cab ( shoukd be a fair price at 900 pesos). You dont get taxis for return",
          "To get to those caves you can either walk or take a cable car - I'd rather take the latter, particularly when with kids. Caves definitely worth seeing and taking pictures. Some snacks available after return (churros!) Generally speaking, when in Monterrey - worth going.",

          "We arrived around noon, it wasn't too packed but they do cram everyone in the teleferico up, luckily it only takes about 3 minutes to go up. I didn't pay so I don't recall the price but it's not expensive maybe 40 to 50 pesos a person. There's alot of walking, up and down",
          "I've visited the caves several times before, this time I want to show them to my kids and girlfriend, as usual the caves are very impressive for first timers; whole experience of cable car, caves, lights effects worth the trip which is very close to Monterrey.",

          "It is a must when visiting Monterrey, although it's 40-50 min away from the city. Had to take a driver and asked him to wait for me for the hour the tour took. It's a beautiful piece of art made by nature. Visitors need to be able to climb stairs since it's all there is.",
          "The caves where spectacular and the mountains were as impressive as the caves, if not more. My advice is to visit this location on a cloudy day where you get to see the clouds clustering around the mountain tops. The view is surreal. A word of caution to families: avoid",
          "This place is magnificent and natural they give you a detail tour in spanish, they also point out some weird looking stalactites and stalagmites also it is great for people who like nature or caves.",

          "Recommended to visit during the day since roads there can be lonely roads with potential crooks waiting for you to pass. Clean facilities and great views from the top, some refreshments sold there and clean restrooms.",

          "Best time to enjoy would be early morning to avoid large crowds. If you bring a camera bring a flash, however if it is a pro-camera you may be fine using long exposures. Staying close to the guide is helpful, since he/she will point out the natural features. Bring shoes suited",

          "I am not sure why the caves are not world known. I\u00b4ve visited several caves with formations all over the world and these are the best, bar-none. The Museum included with your entrance is not worth it, but if you need to kill time before your gondola time, there is really not",
          "You must take a cable car to get all the way up to the mountain, but it is worth making the line. When you get in the caves you are amazed on the beauty of the stalactites and the shapes of the mountain. The view is nice, not beautiful, but worth the wait and the walk.",

          "With a walking river, this tour is a must for a visitor that has never been in this town. During the day and with hot weather, the water and the fountains are a very refreshing option. If you keep walking, eat elotes or any street food. It's very local, yummy and not for weak",
          "An amazing escape in the middle of Monterrey. You can take a boat ride along the roughly 2km man -made river or you can walk along the edge (either side). The boat ride includes informative commentary (in Spanish). The place is spotless and there are lots of fountains, murals,",

          "Honestly, theres really not much to do in monterrey in winter, and this is a bit of a stretch, just because its really cold. But its really pretty, starting just off the macroplaza and finishing in fundidora all the way is nicely done with water fountains and bits of art. very",

          "Beautiful place, is a walk from Parque Fundidora to downton. But can also take a boat, which I recomend if it's summer!!! Because weather can be incredibly hot. At the end of the trip you can visit the museums around, or maybe take a bite in the restarants nearby.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Parque La Huasteca is a municipal park in Monterrey, Mexico and also the first established climbing area, only 20 minutes from the city center. With nearly 300 bolted routes with grades from 5.4 to 5.14, it is the favorite place for weekend climbers. There are no entrance fees for most of the climbing areas\n\n\n== Climbing Areas ==\nCazuelas: Near the entrance, to the left, near an iron door. Harder moderate climbs.\nPico Lico: Past Cazuelas, a triangular rock. Easy climbs.\nLos Perros: On the right, just past the entrance. Very easy climbs.\nLulu: Past Los Perros, to the left and below. Easy climbs.\nPico Independencia: The salient feature of the park on the right of the road, has a via ferrata to the top. Moderate and hard sport, trad, mixed climbs.\nLas Hienas: To the right of Pico Independencia. Difficult climbs.\nZona Extrema: A mile into the canyon, on the left. Easy to harder moderate climbs.\nLos M\u00e9dicos: Past the small village of Nogales. Most popular sport and multi-pitch walls.\nCasa del Doctor: Below and to the right of a house built into the stone.\nLa Marta: Follow the same wall to the right of the routes below Casa del Doctor.\nLa Bestia Cueva: A truly ginormous cave on the hillside at the rear of the canyon.\nVirgincita: The smaller cave to the right of Cueva de Virgin on Independencia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1954 Federico Ram\u00edrez Garc\u00eda, also known as \"Lico\", climbed the first summit of La Huasteca. Today that summit is known as \"Pico Lico\" in his honor. Pico Lico is nearly 70 meters high.\nIn 1957 the most famous peak in La Huasteca was conquered by a climbing club called Pirineos, hence the autonomous name of the peaks \"Los Pirineos\".\nIn 1960 the West Face was first climbed: Alberto Perez from Pirineos climbed almost all the route except the last 60 meters, then a couple of friends threw him a rope from above to complete the climb. The first person to climb the West Face without any assistance was Juan de Dios De Leon Camero. Others followed, conquering more summits and bolting some routes.\nIt the late 1980s and 1990s, sport climbing began with Francisco Medina, and Andres Medina, two brothers and students of the Juan de Dios climbing school.\nThey bolted and climbed the hardest routes in La Huasteca, Veneno and El Sue\u00f1o que de Ni\u00f1o, both 5.13c.\nIn the 2000s climbing became more popular, when the Universidad de Monterrey and the ITESM, two well-recognized universities, started giving climbing courses at La Huasteca.\nIn 2005, the first guidebook was written by Ram\u00f3n Narv\u00e1ez, a local climber. The area appears in the larger English-Spanish Gu\u00eda de Escalada en M\u00e9xico (Zona Norte), using the exact drawings and contents of the original Huasteca guidebook without permission from the author.\nBy 2010 UDEM suspend the climbing courses because of Mexico's recession and the increase in violence in the city during the ongoing \"War on Drugs\".\nDuring Hurricane Alex, La Huasteca was severely impacted, damaging several routes and also lowering the level of the ground by down to 1 meter, making the beginning of some routes unclimbable.\nIn 2014, at-risk youth program Escalando Fronteras joined forces with volunteers to further develop the park for visitors and eco-tourism. The same year, British climber Gareth \"Gaz\" Leah completed the direct line to Huastecas famous Pico Independencia, named \"The Life You Can Save\" 5.12+ 350m. The route name was donated by Alex Honnold who took part in the Escalando Fronteras Kickstarter campaign.\nIn 2016, Gareth \"Gaz\" Leah released a new guidebook to Parque La Huasteca on a digital platform known as RAKKUP covering many new areas not covered in previous guides. The print release is due in the next month.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nLa Huasteca is a desert, very similar to Potrero Chico.\n\n\n== Environmental issues ==\nSince the 1990s, La Huasteca has become a popular weekend destination for families. People number in the hundreds every day, and more in the rare occasions when the river is swollen from heavy rains. Because of the large number of visitors, La Huasteca is suffering from a greater amount of litter.\nDuring 2004 the government tried to solve this problem by charging families 10 pesos to enter some parts of the park, while leaving the climbing areas free to enter. This has not been successful, as families simply stopped entering the paid-access areas and instead went to the free climbing areas, especially \"Navajas\" and \"Cazuelas\".\nFrom late 2004 to late 2005 a new campaign called \"Limpiemos la Huasteca\" was conducted, with the objective of cleaning all the garbage from La Huasteca. Private and public schools, members of the climbing community, members of the cycling community, and anyone else wanting to help were encouraged to clean up this area. To aid in the removal of garbage, the government supplied trucks to transport waste.\nAlthough La Huasteca was improved, much work remained to be done, as the waste was being generated faster than it was being removed.\nAll visitors to la Huasteca are encouraged to bring a bag and remove some waste.\n\n\n== Recent deaths ==\nIn recent years la Huasteca has seen an increase in accidents involving climbers and campers. Local authorities had associated this with the opening of a Via Ferrata route; this controversial route was built over an old classic route El Infierno y las Espinas, rendering the old route useless as most of the new people climbing the route use the Ferrata and don't have the necessary climbing experience.\nThis route has seen the death of at least one person acting as a guide when he did not have the credentials required, and the rescue of another overweight excursionist who couldn't continue and got stuck in the middle of a Tyrolean traverse of 100 metres.\nAdditionally, the mysterious death of two climbers occurred when they fell while rappelling from a multi-pitch route. A non-climbing-related death of a camper occurred by gunfire during a robbery attempt, and another person drowned in the river under the influence of alcohol.\nThe climbing community is planning to address the recent deaths by reviewing the credentials of those who act as climbing guides and teachers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPotrero Chico\nEl Salto\n\n\n== External links ==\nParque La Huasteca\nRoca Libre",

Its construction began in 1535 and it was consecrated on 12 July 1733. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction began in 1535, during which the Temple of San Juan de Dios temporarily served as the cathedral church of the diocese.  In 1640, the cathedral was installed and the seat of the diocese was transferred to Our Lady of the Assumption. Due to earthquakes in the 16th and 18th centuries, the cathedral had to be reconstructed several times, with the most recent reconstruction beginning in 1702 and finishing in 1733.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nIts facade is made of green cantera stone commonly found in Oaxaca's buildings, and the interior is in Neoclassical style. The altar features a statue of Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n) which was made in Italy during the Porfirian era, who is represented by a bronze sculpture brought from Europe and made by Tadoini.The towers of the cathedral are not the originals, as they were destroyed in 1931 by an earthquake. In the south there is a clock donated to Oaxaca by King Fernando VII. The Lord of Lightning is in the last chapel on the left, while the second on the right contains the remains of the Cross of Huatulco.  Atop the west wall of the quire is a locally built baroque pipe organ, parts of which date to 1711-1712, restored in 1997.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nInstituto Nacional de Geograf\u00eda, Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica (1993).

The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMonterrey has several neighborhoods. The most populous include:\n\nIndependencia\nCumbres\nObispado\nContry\nMitras Centro, Norte & Sur\nSan Jer\u00f3nimo\nSan Bernab\u00e9\nValle Alto\nDel Paseo\nValle\nCentrito\nLoma Larga\nSan Agustin\nSat\u00e9lite\nVista Hermosa\nAn\u00e1huac\nFlorida\nPrimavera\nModerna\nAlta VistaThe commercial areas include:\n\nCentro\nCarretera Nacional\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.The Monterrey metropolitan area is the third most populous in Mexico with more than 4 million.

The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States.\nMonterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 2 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: General Mariano Escobedo International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to key United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.Five airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey, Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. There is no public transportation from Monterrey International Airport to the city. However, the Miguel Aleman highway interchange where public transportation is readily available is approximately 3 kilometers from the airport and can easily be reached on foot.  A cartel of taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo. Inter-city bus services run daily into the interior, as well as north to the US border and points beyond.  \n\n\n=== Health ===\nMonterrey generally has a very highly ranked medical infrastructure with some internationally acclaimed hospitals,\nincluding three with Joint Commission accreditation.\nThe Joint Commission is a private healthcare accreditation group.

The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.Industrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey, a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services). The FEMSA corporation owned a large brewery, the Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery (Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma) that produces the brands Sol, Tecate, Indio, Dos Equis and Carta Blanca among others, in the beginning of the year Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery was sold to Dutch-based company Heineken. By the end of the same year, there were more than 13,000 manufacturing companies, 55,000 retail stores, and more than 52,000 service firms in Monterrey.The metals sector, dominated by iron and steel, accounted for 6 percent of manufacturing GNP in 1994. Mexico's steel industry is centered in Monterrey, where the country's first steel mills opened in 1903. Steel processing plants in Monterrey, privatized in 1986, accounted for about half of Mexico's total steel output in the early 1990s.Monterrey was ranked 94th worldwide and fifth in Latin America in terms of Quality of Life according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2006), and was ranked second in 2005 and fourth in 2006, according to Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda.\nSome of the shopping malls in the city include Paseo San Pedro, Paseo La Fe, Plaza Fiesta San Agust\u00edn, Galer\u00edas Monterrey, and Galer\u00edas Valle Oriente, which distribute goods and services to the Mexican population.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMonterrey has an estimated 3.7% rate of illiteracy.

It also holds a \"QS Stars Rated for Excellence\" of 5 stars.\nThe Universidad Regiomontana was founded in 1969 with the support of local leading multinational corporations such as Cemex, Alfa, Femsa, Gamesa, Protexa and CYDSA. It is a private educational institution offering university-preparatory school, undergraduate and graduate programs. It has agreements with more than 350 universities across the globe (such as the recent expanded agreement with Texas A&M International University). It is member of GATE (Global Alliance for Transnational Education) and FIMPES (Federaci\u00f3n de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educaci\u00f3n Superior) and its administration holds an ISO 9001 Certification. The university is nationally recognized, so its degree equivalency is comparable to that of a regionally accredited university in the United States. The university is dedicated to educating students in an atmosphere of freedom and humanism, and providing students hands-on experience in their field of study. Its urban campus further stimulates the city\u2019s vibrant economy and attracts working professionals who complement and enrich the academic experience.\nThe Universidad de Monterrey was founded by the religious congregations of the Sisters of Immaculate Mary of Guadalupe, the nuns of the Sacred Heart and the Marist and La Salle brothers, all of them supported by an association of Catholic citizens.

Other local dishes and customs that perhaps date back to the Crypto-Judaism of Monterrey's founding families are the \"semita\" (bread without leavening), the capirotada dessert (a mix of cooked bread, cheese, raisins, peanuts, and crystallized sugarcane juice), and the relative absence of pork dishes. Another famous local dish is machacado con huevo.\nCarne asada on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and sausages or chopped as tacos. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. \"Glorias\" and \"obleas,\" made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo Le\u00f3n desserts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMonterrey has two football teams in the Mexican league. The C.F. Monterrey, commonly known as the Rayados del Monterrey, uses the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, a facility sponsored by BBVA Bancomer and other important businesses.

During the match, most of the city watches in bars, clubs, and family homes. It was proposed to build a stadium for both teams, the \"Estadio Internacional Monterrey\", but both teams rejected the idea. The project is still being promoted, but the UANL Tigres have yet to finish their stadium contract and the Rayados just inaugurated a new stadium of their own. Club de F\u00fatbol Monterrey recently opened a new stadium with a capacity of 50,000.

        "wiki": "Adrian Fisher is a maze and puzzle designer, responsible for more than 700 mazes in 35 countries since 1979.\nFisher has created 48 mirror mazes, and pioneered the extensive use of thematic chambers within mirror mazes, to achieve Mirror Maze Adventures.  He has created 44 hedge mazes, and pioneered the use of Folly Towers, Tunnels, Walk-through Parting Waterfalls and Foaming Fountain Gates in mazes.  He designed the world's first cornfield maize maze in 1993 and over 400 since, and has set 7 Guinness World Records.  He has created water mazes, most notably the award-winning Beatles Maze, and the Jersey Water Maze.  He pioneered the genre of Path-in-Grass Mazes, and has created over a dozen around the world.  \nFisher has invented several brick paving and mosaic tiling systems.  For the Orang Utan Pavement Maze at Edinburgh Zoo, he invented a new paver tessellation using 7-sided and 5-sided (regular pentagon) bricks.  The 'Fisher Paver', his second paving system uses 7-sided and 4-sided bricks and has been installed within paving projects on both sides of the Atlantic.  Its benefits include being able to achieve dynamic and intriguing designs straight off the pallet with no cutting, thus offering excellent labour productivity when laying; it only requires one new 7-sided paver shape, yet its modular scale matches all industry-standard paving systems.  Adrian's third paving system is the Mitre System, which he invented and patented together with the American mathematician Ed Pegg.  Used for both mosaics and paving, their distinctive angular shapes create unique and pleasing images.  Notable examples of its use in England include four Historic Mosaics with the Millennium Maze in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and the 24 ft high SciTec Mosaic at Oundle School, Northamptonshire; and in America, the Tree of Life Mosaic in a private garden in Roxbury, Connecticut.\nHis innovative Colour Mazes have been published in Scientific American, and walk-on examples can be found in the New York Hall of Science, Eureka Children's Museum in Halifax England, The Exploratory in Bristol, Cape Coral Children's Science Center in Florida, and over 30 other locations worldwide.\nFisher designs puzzles for British newspapers and the World Puzzle Championships. The Guardian newspaper named him as one of Britain's top 50 designers.A major Maze Art Exhibition on Adrian Fisher's work was held at the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, from January to March 1997; it included the creation of full-size permanent mazes in the surrounding landscape, and the publication \"Your Land is His Canvas\". \nFisher was Director of Britain's \"1991 \u2013 The Year of the Maze\" Tourism Campaign.  He was the recipient of the 2003 Resorgimento Award at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA, on May 24, 2003, \"in recognition of those who have demonstrated outstanding creativity, who have and will continue to change the world in which we live\".

        "wiki": "The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe (Spanish: Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe) is a Roman Catholic church, basilica, and National shrine of Mexico which houses the cloak containing the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The 1709 shrine was built in the North of Mexico City near the hill of Tepeyac, where the Virgin Mary is believed to have appeared to Saint Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin. The basilica structure which now contains Diego's cloak was completed in 1974.\nThis site is also known as La Villa de Guadalupe or, in a more popular sense, La Villa, and has several churches and related buildings.\nOne of the most important pilgrimage sites of Catholicism, the basilica and tilma (cloak) are visited by several million people every year, especially around 12 December, Our Lady of Guadalupe's Feast day.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nA nearby chapel was built on the sacred site devoted to a temple for Tonantzin Coatlaxopeuh, an important mother goddess, after the Spanish conquerors destroyed the temple.\nPilgrimages have been made to this shrine almost uninterrupted since 1531\u201332. In the latter year, a shrine had been constructed at the foot of Tepeyac Hill, which served the people for ninety years. It was adapted as part of the parochial sacristy of the new basilica. In 1622 a rich shrine was erected; a newer one, much richer, in 1709. Other structures of the eighteenth century connected with it are a parish church, a convent and church for Capuchin nuns, a well chapel, and a hill chapel. About 1750 the shrine got the title of collegiate, and a canonry and choir service were established. In 1754 it was aggregated to the Basilica of St. John Lateran. In 1904 it was designated as a basilica.\n\n\n== Old basilica ==\nOfficially known as the \"Templo Expiatorio a Cristo Rey,\" the first structure of the old basilica was begun in 1695  and it was not finished until 1709. The major architect was Pedro de Arrieta. It is characterized by its doric interior and marble statues of Fray Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, archbishop at the time it was started, and Juan Diego, the peasant who saw the vision of the Virgin Mary. These are featured in the altarpiece that originally held the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. (That altarpiece matches a similar one in the older chapel higher on the hill, which features the archangels Gabriel and Michael). The church was granted basilica status by Pope Pius X in 1904.\nThe icon of Juan Diego's cloak was housed in this church from 1709 to 1974. In 1921 a bomb planted in a flower vase near the altar by an anticlerical terrorist exploded, causing great damage to the interior of the building. (In memory of this incident, the New Basilica displays an iron crucifix called \"the attempt on Christ\".) The cloak survived undamaged.\nAs much of Mexico City is built upon the dried lakebed of Lake Texcoco, the land was unstable and the old basilica was sinking. A new, more spacious basilica was built. The old one was closed for many years and repairs have recently finished. It is open to the public and perpetual adoration is held there. It is a very important place in Mexico City.\n\n\n== Modern basilica ==\n\nThe present church was constructed on the site of an earlier 16th-century church that was finished in 1709, the Old Basilica. When this basilica became dangerous due to the sinking of its foundations, a modern structure called the New Basilica was built next to it; the original image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is now housed in this New Basilica. Built between 1974 and 1976, the new Basilica has a circular floorplan so that the image of the Virgin can be seen from any point within the building. The circular structure is 100 meters (330 ft) in diameter and can accommodate up to 10,000 people. The choir is located between the altar and the churchgoers to indicate that it, too, is part of the group of the faithful. To the sides are the chapels of the Santisimo and of Saint Joseph. It has 9 chapels on the upper floor. Under the main floor are the Basilica's crypts, with 15,000 niches and 10 chapels. Its seven front doors are an allusion to the seven gates of Celestial Jerusalem referred to by Christ. In the Sanctuary grounds where the new Basilica is located there are also many other buildings, including the original chapel on the exact site of the apparitions to Juan Diego (Capilla del Cerrito) and the Old Basilica consecrated in 1709, as well as other chapels where Masses and other sacraments of the Church are celebrated daily.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholic Marian churches\nList of colonial churches in Mexico City\nMexico City Metropolitan Cathedral\nThe Basilica of Guadalupe in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico\nMonastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe, in Spain\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, George (1913). \"Shrine of Guadalupe\" .

        "wiki": "Popularly known as the Barrio Antiguo (Spanish old quarter) comprise what is preserved from the historical quarter of the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. Currently located next to the Government Palace and the Macroplaza, it originally covered a larger space from the Santa Catarina River to 5 de Mayo Street, south to north, and from Mina Street to Roble Street (nowadays Avenida Benito Ju\u00e1rez), east to west. Most of the buildings now preserved are from the Spanish Colonial period and from the last years of the 19th century.      \nArchaeologically speaking, the oldest Monterrey dates from the very founding of the city at the end of the sixteenth century. However, the buildings preserved today date mostly from the eighteenth century onwards. It used to be the commercial and cultural center of the city during the existence of the Viceroyalty of New Spain until recently the first half of the 20th century, when other parts of the city began to grow more to the detriment of the center. During the last decades of the 20th century there was a modern lifestyle in the Barrio Antiguo, characterized by the construction of hotels, museums, bars, discos and restaurants of international cuisine. Thus until depopulation and partial abandonment tended to decline from the 1990s to recent times, as currently there are projects under way for its restoration. Many houses of what used to be the Barrio Antiguo were demolished to give way to the construction of the Macroplaza (lit. big square) at the end of the past century. During the last decade of the twentieth century and recent years, Barrio Antiguo was well known as the center of the nightlife of Monterrey due to measures taken by the State in a failed attempt to create reforms that pushed the re-activation of the urban center.   \nSince 2006, due to the insecurity that was rampant in the city of Monterrey, nightlife in the Barrio Antiguo almost ended, but since recent times due to the relative decline in violence many of the bars have managed to survive. From the year 2013 the government changed the way in which the Old Quarter was considered. A restoration project was started since then, which seeks to build a space for cultural recreation and preservation of the historic heritage, through the closure of some of its streets now pedestrianized (so far is the case of Calle Morelos) and re-activation Social or family business.\n\n\n== Venues ==\nAntr\u00f3polis\nCaf\u00e9 Iguana\nIbex Rock Bar\nLa Galer\u00eda Caf\u00e9\nManaus\nMcMullen's Irish Pub\nMonasterio\nNeuken\nCasa Morelos\nNovum\nNueva Luna\nRiviera\nTrece Bar\nThe Bean Lounge\nClandestino\nArt Club\nLa TumbaAnd many more clubs and bars.",

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMonterrey has several neighborhoods. The most populous include:\n\nIndependencia\nCumbres\nObispado\nContry\nMitras Centro, Norte & Sur\nSan Jer\u00f3nimo\nSan Bernab\u00e9\nValle Alto\nDel Paseo\nValle\nCentrito\nLoma Larga\nSan Agustin\nSat\u00e9lite\nVista Hermosa\nAn\u00e1huac\nFlorida\nPrimavera\nModerna\nAlta VistaThe commercial areas include:\n\nCentro\nCarretera Nacional\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.The Monterrey metropolitan area is the third most populous in Mexico with more than 4 million. It comprises the municipalities of Monterrey, Apodaca, Escobedo, Garc\u00eda, Guadalupe, Santiago, Ju\u00e1rez, San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina and Salinas Victoria.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nMonterrey is connected with the United States\u2013Mexico border, the sea and inland Mexico through different roads, including the Carretera Nacional (also known as the Panamerican Highway) that runs from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City and south, and the Carretera Interoce\u00e1nica connecting Matamoros with the port of Mazatl\u00e1n on the Pacific; it is also crossed by highways 40, 45, 57. The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States.\nMonterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 2 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: General Mariano Escobedo International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to key United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.Five airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey, Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. There is no public transportation from Monterrey International Airport to the city. However, the Miguel Aleman highway interchange where public transportation is readily available is approximately 3 kilometers from the airport and can easily be reached on foot.  A cartel of taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo.

        "wiki": "The museum Papalote Museo del Ni\u00f1o is located in Mexico City Bosques de Chapultepec. The museum is focused in learning, communication and working together through interactive expositions of science, technology and art for children.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThis museum was created in 1993 by the architect Ricardo Legorreta. He designed the building with geometric figures and traditional Mexican tiles. The building was made for kids to interact, experiment and touch. The ceiling and walls were made by children.\n\n\n== Areas ==\nThis museum has over 288 interactive exhibitions, divided into five areas where children can touch, play, and learn, as its motto says. Children become familiar with such subjects as ecology, the human body, science, and music. Each area features exhibitions about an aspect of human development.\nSoy: Spanish for \"I am\". Focuses on the way human body and mind work. Themes featured are identity, self-esteem, and knowledge of one's body and emotions.\nComunico: Spanish for \"I communicate myself\". Focuses on the different ways people can communicate with each other, from spoken and sign language to radio, television and newspaper, helping to understand how each one of them works.\nPertenezco: Spanish for \"I belong\". Focuses on helping the children to understand themselves in terms of the spaces they belong to, going from what it is most close to them, their family, to the most complex, the universe, and the necessity to protect the environment they live in.\nComprendo: Spanish for \"I understand\". Focuses on science, comprising physics, mathematics, chemistry and geology, helping to understand what does science mean to the world.\nExpreso: Spanish for \"I express myself\". Focuses on developing abilities in creativity and imagination to express ideas, feelings and thoughts throughout art, creation, discovery and appreciation.\n\n\n== Other attractions ==\nThe museum has one of the biggest digital screens in Mexico City and the only one in Latin America. It's an IMAXscreen with a capacity for over 333 people, where educational and recreational videos are screened.Next to it, the museum features the jardin maya, an archeology-themed garden where a prehispanic environment is recreated, including a pyramid to explore.\n\n\n== Similar museums in Mexico ==\nBesides its own educational role, Papalote has helped to launch similarly themed museums in other parts of the country, from which the closest to Papalote itself are:\nPapalote de Cuernavaca, focused in the children's aesthetic experience through the art. In spite of not having the technological level of the Mexico City museum, features over 300 artwork among drawings, painting, photography, sculptures, installations and videos.In 2010 the incorporation of Papalote Museum will make another museum, The Green Museum, in Monterrey, but this time focused in the educational environment.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] Papalote Museum\n[2] Hispanic parents\n[3] IMAX\n[4] Papalote Cuernavaca",

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nMonterrey has several neighborhoods. The most populous include:\n\nIndependencia\nCumbres\nObispado\nContry\nMitras Centro, Norte & Sur\nSan Jer\u00f3nimo\nSan Bernab\u00e9\nValle Alto\nDel Paseo\nValle\nCentrito\nLoma Larga\nSan Agustin\nSat\u00e9lite\nVista Hermosa\nAn\u00e1huac\nFlorida\nPrimavera\nModerna\nAlta VistaThe commercial areas include:\n\nCentro\nCarretera Nacional\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the national INEGI population census of 2010, of the total population of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, 87.3% lived in the Monterrey metropolitan area.The Monterrey metropolitan area is the third most populous in Mexico with more than 4 million. It comprises the municipalities of Monterrey, Apodaca, Escobedo, Garc\u00eda, Guadalupe, Santiago, Ju\u00e1rez, San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina and Salinas Victoria.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nMonterrey is connected with the United States\u2013Mexico border, the sea and inland Mexico through different roads, including the Carretera Nacional (also known as the Panamerican Highway) that runs from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City and south, and the Carretera Interoce\u00e1nica connecting Matamoros with the port of Mazatl\u00e1n on the Pacific; it is also crossed by highways 40, 45, 57. The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main land corridor to interior Mexico.\nThere are several between-cities bus lines at the bus station downtown. There are arrivals and departures into deeper Mexico, to the U.S. border and into the United States.\nMonterrey is also connected by at least three important railroad freight lines: Nuevo Laredo-Mexico City, Monterrey-Tampico, and Monterrey-Pacific (Mazatl\u00e1n).\nThe city has a rapid transit system called Metrorrey, which currently has 2 lines. and a BRT called Ecov\u00eda.\nThe city is served by two international airports: General Mariano Escobedo International Airport (served by major international carriers and moving more than 6.5 million passengers in 2007) and Del Norte International Airport, a primarily private airport.\nMonterrey is linked through frequent non-stop flights to many Mexican cities and to key United States hubs (Atlanta, Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Houston-Intercontinental, JFK/New York, and Las Vegas). Monterrey is the second most important city for the operating routes of Aerom\u00e9xico.Five airlines have their operational bases and headquarters in Monterrey, Volaris, Aerom\u00e9xico Connect, VivaAerobus and Magnicharters. There is no public transportation from Monterrey International Airport to the city. However, the Miguel Aleman highway interchange where public transportation is readily available is approximately 3 kilometers from the airport and can easily be reached on foot.  A cartel of taxi services link the airport with the city and charge around US$20 for a one-way ride to the city. From this airport, there is a bus shuttle to nearby Saltillo. Inter-city bus services run daily into the interior, as well as north to the US border and points beyond.  \n\n\n=== Health ===\nMonterrey generally has a very highly ranked medical infrastructure with some internationally acclaimed hospitals,\nincluding three with Joint Commission accreditation.\nThe Joint Commission is a private healthcare accreditation group. There are both public and private hospitals. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) has two major regional hospitals in the city, the Specialties Regional Hospital # 33, the cardiac centre (Hospital #34), and the Gynecology and Obstetrics Regional Hospital, serving also the northeastern states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas. Several smaller IMSS hospitals can be found such as the Traumatology and Orthopedics Hospital and the General Hospital # 25. State government owns the Metropolitan Hospital, located in the suburb of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and the Hospital of the Children and Mother Care in Guadalupe suburb.\nThe Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n runs the public University Hospital, with a high-level shock-trauma unit and a specialized clinic for child cancer treatment. It is recognized as the best public hospital in the northeast of Mexico and the UANL School of Medicine as one of the best in the country. On the other hand, the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey runs the Hospital San Jos\u00e9-Tec de Monterrey private hospital.\nMonterrey has healthcare standards above the average for Mexico. It has several hospitals, including Hospital Cima (formerly Santa Engracia) of the International Hospital Corporation. Its convenient location, low prices and quality of medical care have made of Monterrey a very popular medical tourism destination for United States patients.\n\n\n=== Monterrey public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Monterrey, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 85 min. 25% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 min, while 29.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 9.5 km, while 25% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMonterrey is a major industrial center in northern Mexico, producing a GDP of 78.5 billion US dollars (2006). The city's GDP per capita in 2010 was 607,042 Mexican pesos or $46,634 US dollars. The city was rated by Fortune magazine in 1999 as the best city in Latin America for business and is currently ranked third best by the Am\u00e9rica Econom\u00eda magazine.The city has prominent positions in sectors such as steel, cement, glass, auto parts, and brewing. The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.Industrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey, a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services). The FEMSA corporation owned a large brewery, the Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery (Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma) that produces the brands Sol, Tecate, Indio, Dos Equis and Carta Blanca among others, in the beginning of the year Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery was sold to Dutch-based company Heineken.

        "wiki": "Popularly known as the Barrio Antiguo (Spanish old quarter) comprise what is preserved from the historical quarter of the city of Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. Currently located next to the Government Palace and the Macroplaza, it originally covered a larger space from the Santa Catarina River to 5 de Mayo Street, south to north, and from Mina Street to Roble Street (nowadays Avenida Benito Ju\u00e1rez), east to west. Most of the buildings now preserved are from the Spanish Colonial period and from the last years of the 19th century.      \nArchaeologically speaking, the oldest Monterrey dates from the very founding of the city at the end of the sixteenth century. However, the buildings preserved today date mostly from the eighteenth century onwards. It used to be the commercial and cultural center of the city during the existence of the Viceroyalty of New Spain until recently the first half of the 20th century, when other parts of the city began to grow more to the detriment of the center. During the last decades of the 20th century there was a modern lifestyle in the Barrio Antiguo, characterized by the construction of hotels, museums, bars, discos and restaurants of international cuisine. Thus until depopulation and partial abandonment tended to decline from the 1990s to recent times, as currently there are projects under way for its restoration. Many houses of what used to be the Barrio Antiguo were demolished to give way to the construction of the Macroplaza (lit. big square) at the end of the past century. During the last decade of the twentieth century and recent years, Barrio Antiguo was well known as the center of the nightlife of Monterrey due to measures taken by the State in a failed attempt to create reforms that pushed the re-activation of the urban center.   \nSince 2006, due to the insecurity that was rampant in the city of Monterrey, nightlife in the Barrio Antiguo almost ended, but since recent times due to the relative decline in violence many of the bars have managed to survive. From the year 2013 the government changed the way in which the Old Quarter was considered. A restoration project was started since then, which seeks to build a space for cultural recreation and preservation of the historic heritage, through the closure of some of its streets now pedestrianized (so far is the case of Calle Morelos) and re-activation Social or family business.\n\n\n== Venues ==\nAntr\u00f3polis\nCaf\u00e9 Iguana\nIbex Rock Bar\nLa Galer\u00eda Caf\u00e9\nManaus\nMcMullen's Irish Pub\nMonasterio\nNeuken\nCasa Morelos\nNovum\nNueva Luna\nRiviera\nTrece Bar\nThe Bean Lounge\nClandestino\nArt Club\nLa TumbaAnd many more clubs and bars.",

        "wiki": "Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) (English: Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), also known as Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, is a secular and coeducational multi-campus private university based in Monterrey, Mexico. ITESM has since grown to include 36 campuses throughout the country, quickly becoming one of the most prestigious universities in Latin America.ITESM was the first university to be connected to the Internet in Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world, having the top-ranked business school in the region according to the Economist  and being one of the leaders in patent applications among Mexican universities. The medical school offers the only MD-PhD program available in Mexico, in partnership with the Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe institute was founded on September 6, 1943 by a group of local businessmen led by Eugenio Garza Sada, a moneyed heir of a brewing conglomerate who was interested in creating an institution that could provide highly skilled personnel \u2014 both university graduates and technicians\u2014 to the booming Monterrey corporations of the 1940s. The group was structured into a non-profit organization called Ense\u00f1anza e Investigaci\u00f3n Superior A.C. (EISAC) and recruited several academicians led by Le\u00f3n \u00c1valos y Vez, an MIT alumnus and then director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute, who designed its first academic programs and served as its first director-general.In its early years the Institute operated at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block and a half away from Zaragoza Square, behind the city's Metropolitan Cathedral. As these facilities soon proved to be insufficient, it started renting out adjacent buildings and by 1945 it became apparent that a university campus was necessary. For that reason, a master plan was commissioned to Enrique de la Mora and on February 3, 1947 what would later be known as its Monterrey Campus was inaugurated by Mexican President Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s.Because the operations of the local companies were highly reliant on U.S. markets, investments, and technology; internationalization became one of its earliest priorities. In 1950 it became the first foreign university in history to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), one of the six regional accreditation agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education. Its foreign accreditation would end up being a decisive influence in its development, as it was forced to submit itself to external evaluation earlier than most Mexican universities (1967)  and unlocked additional sources of revenue, such as tuition funds from foreign students interested in taking summer courses in Mexico for full-academic credit.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nIts growth outside the city of Monterrey began in the late-1960s, when both its rector and head of academics lobbied for expansion. A first attempt, funded a few years earlier by several businessmen from Mexicali, Baja California, was staffed and organized by the Institute but faced opposition from the Board of Trustees once the federal government refused any additional subsidy and members of the Board cast doubt on its ability to get funds as an out-of-state university. At the end the project was renamed Centro de Ense\u00f1anza T\u00e9cnica y Superior (CETYS) and grew into a fully independent institution.Aside from the CETYS experiment and the 150 hectares bought in 1951 for the agricultural program's experimental facilities in nearby Apodaca, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, no other expansion outside Monterrey was attempted until 1967, when a school of maritime studies was built in the port of Guaymas, Sonora. Shortly thereafter, premises were built in Obreg\u00f3n and courses began to be offered in Mexico City. Those premises and the ones that followed, then called external units, were fully dependent on the Monterrey Campus until 1984, when they were restructured as semi-independent campuses and reorganized in regional rectorates (see Organization).\nIn 1987, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools demanded faculty members with master's degrees to lecture 100% of its undergraduate courses, the Institute invested considerably in both distance learning and computer network technologies and training, effectively becoming, on February 1, 1989, the first university ever connected to the Internet in both Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world. Such efforts contributed to the creation of its former Virtual University a few years later and allowed it to become the first country-code top level domain registry in Mexico; first by itself from 1989 to 1995, and then as a major shareholder of NIC Mexico, the current national registry.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\nThere are thirty-one campuses of the Institute distributed in twenty-five Mexican cities. Each campus is relatively independent but shares a national academic curriculum (see Academics). The flagship campus is located in Monterrey, where the national, system-wide rectorate is located. Most of them deliver both high school and undergraduate education, some offer postgraduate programs and only eight (Cumbres, Eugenio Garza Sada, Eugenio Garza Lag\u00fcera, Santa Catarina, Metepec, Santa Anita, Esmeralda and Valle Alto) deliver high school courses exclusively. Nevertheless, curricular and extension courses and seminars are usually available at most facilities.\n\n\n=== Campuses by region ===\n\nAs of June 2019, campuses were divided into the following Mexican regions:\nNorth: Monterrey, PrepaTec Cumbres, PrepaTec Eugenio Garza Lag\u00fcera, PrepaTec Eugenio Garza Sada, Prepa Tec Santa Catarina, PrepaTec Valle Alto, Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Laguna, Saltillo, Tampico and Zacatecas.\nMexico City: Mexico City, Santa Fe, State of Mexico, PrepaTec Esmeralda,\nSouth: Chiapas, Cuernavaca, Hidalgo, PrepaTec Metepec, Puebla, Toluca and Veracruz Central.\nWest: Colima, Guadalajara, Irapuato, Le\u00f3n, Morelia, PrepaTec Navojoa, Northern Sonora, Obreg\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro, San Luis Potos\u00ed, PrepaTec Santa Anita and Sinaloa.Former campuses include Guaymas (transferred to TecMilenio University in the early 2000s) and Mazatl\u00e1n (transferred to TecMilenio University in 2009).\n\n\n=== Other infrastructure ===\nIn addition to the campuses, the Institute manages:\n\nThe Ignacio A. Santos Medical School, the Hospital San Jos\u00e9 and the Zambrano-Hellion Medical Center.\nEight international sites in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Colombia (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn), Ecuador (Guayaquil and Quito), Panama (Panama City), Peru (Lima) and the United States (Miami) offering extension courses, research and international consulting.\nFifteen liaison offices in charge of forging international partnerships and negotiating professional internships and academic exchanges with local universities, companies and civil institutions. Current liaison offices are located in Belgium (Brussels), Canada (Montreal and Vancouver), China (Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai), France (Nice and Paris), Italy (Florence, Macerata and Verona), Switzerland (Fribourg), Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston, Dallas and Washington, D.C.)\n\n\n== Organization ==\n\nAll campuses are sponsored by non-profit organizations composed primarily of local businesspeople. The Monterrey Campus is sponsored by Ense\u00f1anza e Investigaci\u00f3n Superior, A.C. (EISAC), which co-sponsored the system as a whole until a newly built organization, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, A.C. (ITESM AC) overtook those responsibilities. Such organizations (effectively serving as boards of trustees) are responsible for electing the rectors or directors of a particular campus. Since February 2012, the president of ITESMAC is Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, a class of 1976 alumnus and current chairman and CEO of FEMSA. Former presidents include the founder, Eugenio Garza Sada (1943\u201373) and his son, Eugenio Garza Lag\u00fcera (1973\u201397), and Lorenzo Zambrano (1997\u20132012), a class of 1966 alumnus and until his passing.Former heads of the Institute include:\n\nLe\u00f3n \u00c1valos y Vez (1943\u20131947) first director-general.\nRoberto Guajardo Su\u00e1rez (1947\u20131951) second director-general.\nV\u00edctor Bravo Ahuja (1951\u20131958) third director-general, and from April 11, 1955, first rector.\nFernando Garc\u00eda Roel (1959\u20131984) second rector.\nRafael Rangel Sostmann (1985\u20132011) third rector.\nSalvador Alva (2011\u20132019) fourth rector and Executive President.Since 2020, The Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey Rector and Executive President is David Garza Salazar.\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nFollowing the historical trend of Mexico's largest universities, the Institute sponsors several high schools that share one or more national curricula: bicultural,  multicultural and/or International Baccalaureate, which is administered from Geneva, Switzerland. The bicultural focuses on better understanding of the English language, the multicultural program requires studying a third language and to have an exchange program abroad. Finally, the IB is an academically challenging program where students can obtain the IB Diploma when they graduate. Additionally, students can receive college credits both at the TEC and universities abroad. Multicultural students are able to take IB courses if they wish with the focus on obtaining IB Subject Certificates. As of December 2017, over 26,000 students in several campuses were registered as high school students within the system.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\nAcademically, the university is organized into several departments and divisions \u2014as opposed to the traditional faculty school scheme used by most Mexican public universities\u2014 and it was the first Mexican university in history to divide the academic year in semesters. Current academic calendar for both high school and undergraduate students is composed of two semesters running from August to December and from January to May (each lasting 16 weeks) and an optional summer session from June to July, where at most two courses can be taken in an intensive basis.As of 2010, the institute offers 57 undergraduate degrees, of which 37 are taught in English and are generally awarded after nine semesters of study (except for Medicine and Architecture); 33 master's degrees, generally lasting three to five semesters (and can also be structured in three-months terms), and 11 doctorate degrees varying in length according to their academic field.\n\n\n=== Admissions ===\nSince 1969 the Institute requires every college applicant to achieve a minimum pass mark at an academic aptitude test (Prueba de Aptitud Acad\u00e9mica, PAA) delivered by The College Board, a not-for-profit examination board in the United States. However, each campus is free to request additional requirements; such as a grade average of 80 or 90 in high school (on a 100-point scale) for those willing to transfer or apply to the Monterrey Campus. As for the graduate schools, the requirements may vary according to the discipline, such as a grade average of 80/100 and 550-points in both the GMAT and the TOEFL for some programs at its Graduate Business School (EGADE).\n\n\n=== Accreditations ===\n\nStudies at the Tech are officially accredited by the Secretariat of Public Education of Mexico (Secretar\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica, SEP) and by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) of the United States. In November 2008, its graduate business school (EGADE) became one of the 34 business schools in the world to hold simultaneous accreditation of its programs by the AACSB of the United States, the Association of MBAs of the United Kingdom and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) while the Institute became the first Latin American university in history to receive full-accreditation on some of its engineering programs by ABET (as opposed to the traditional substantially-equivalent designation given to most schools outside the United States).The quality of its programs is also audited by the Institute of Food Technologists, the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management and by the national accrediting councils of Mexico, such as the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (Consejo para la Acreditaci\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior, COPAES) and the Inter-Institutional Committees for Higher Education Evaluation (Comit\u00e9s Interinstitucionales de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior, CIEES).As of 2017, 169 undergraduate degrees were accredited by national accrediting councils and 36 were accredited by international accrediting agencies. As for graduate degrees, 11 were accredited by international accrediting agencies and 58 were listed in the National Census of High-Quality Postgraduate Studies (Padr\u00f3n Nacional de Posgrados de Calidad, PNPC) by the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT).\n\n\n=== Academic memberships ===\n\nThe institute is the only Latin American institution at the European Consortium of Innovative Universities (ECIU) \u2014an organization committed to innovations in both teaching and learning\u2014 and at Universitas 21; an international network of research-intensive universities established as an \"international reference point and resource for strategic thinking on issues of global significance.\" It is also the only Mexican university, along the National Autonomous University of Mexico, to be enrolled at the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, an international consortium of leading research universities including Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and Caltech. The institute was also the first private university to become a member of the National Association of Universities and Institutions of Higher Education of Mexico (ANUIES) back when it was composed entirely by public universities (1958) and is a full member of the Mexican Federation of Private Institutions of Higher Education (Federaci\u00f3n de Instituciones Mexicanas Particulares de Educaci\u00f3n Superior, FIMPES). The university recently became a partner of Washington University of St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.\n\n\n=== Faculty ===\n\nThe institute has over 10,000 professors at high school, undergraduate and postgraduate levels: 2,207 tenured and 7,900 associated professors, and all of them have the appropriate academic credentials to lecture at their corresponding academic level according to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. As of 2017 some 470 professors taught courses, worked in international projects or attended seminars or congresses at foreign universities while some 590 foreign professors taught courses at the Tech.  As for their academic development, its faculty training program was bestowed with the 2004 Andrew Heiskell Award for Innovation in International Education by the Institute of International Education.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nThe institute has at least thirty-three libraries in twenty-five Mexican cities holding over 2.4 million books, publications, and 46 types of electronic databases with at least 51,000 specialized magazines and academic journals and over 9000 e-books. Its Cervantean Library, named after Miguel de Cervantes and located in the current rectorate, holds one of the largest collections of Don Quixote incunabula, an original edition of L'Encyclop\u00e9die,  and the Mario Pani Archives, and other bibliographical treasures while the main library of the Monterrey Campus holds the personal collections of archaeologist Ignacio Bernal.\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\nOverall, the institute is the only Mexican university besides the National Autonomous University of Mexico to be ranked at the 2010 QS World University Rankings, in which it was classified #65 worldwide at its Employer's Review, #269 in Engineering and Information Technology, #232 in Social Sciences and #387 at its overall ranking. In the 2010 International Professional Ranking of World Universities, developed by the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris, it ranked 224 out of 390 worldwide.Among its graduate schools, EGADE has been ranked 7th among the best business schools outside the United States according to the Wall Street Journal (2006), 4th in the world in business ethics and social-responsibility programs according to BusinessWeek magazine (2005), among the 100 best graduate business schools in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (2009) and its OneMBA program, delivered in partnership with four different institutions (see Joint programs and international partnerships below) was ranked 27 worldwide by the Financial Times in its 2009 Executive Master in Business Administration rankings.\n\n\n=== Joint programs and international partnerships ===\n\nSome of its academic programs are offered as joint degrees or in partnership with foreign universities:\n\nIts Master of Science in Information Technology is offered as a joint degree with Carnegie-Mellon University, which is ranked 4th for graduate studies in computer science in 2008 according to US News and World Report and 7th in Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences among Shanghai Jiao Tong University's world's top 100 universities.\nThe OneMBA degree is offered through a partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Rotterdam School of Management of the Netherlands, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Getulio Vargas Foundation of Brazil and is ranked 27 worldwide among executive MBAs by the Financial Times.\nThe B.A. Finance and Accounting is offered as a joint degree with the University of Texas at Austin, Master in Professional Accounting, ranked #1 Graduate Accounting School in the U.S. by US News and World report since 2007. [2]\nThe Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering is offered in partnership with the Universit\u00e9 de Technologie de Troyes in France and with the Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec, Canada.\nThe Global MBA for Latin American Managers is offered in partnership with the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which has been ranked consistently by US News & World Report as the #1 school in International Management since 1995.\nThe medical degree is offered as a dual Ph.D. program with the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences of the Texas A&M Health Science Center.\nAn International MBA program is offered as a joint degree with the University of San Diego.\nThe institute has a strategic partnership with Johns Hopkins Hospital through Johns Hopkins Medicine International.\nThe Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Global Business and Strategy (MBA-GBS) is a double degree MBA program jointly offered by the Graduate School of Business Administration and Leadership (EGADE) at the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey, and the Belk College of Business (Belk College) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\nThe bachelor's degrees in Chemical Engineering are offered as joint degrees with the Reutlingen University of Germany.\nSeveral ITESM high schools offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, which is administered by the Geneva-based International Baccalaureate.\nThe school partners with New York City-based Trilogy Education Services to host a tech training program on ITESM's Mexico campus.\n\n\n== Medical school ==\n\nThe Ignacio A. Santos School of Medicine (Escuela de Medicina Ignacio A. Santos, aka: EMIS) is the medical school division of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). Established in 1978 in Monterrey, Mexico.The School of Medicine was founded to satisfy the country's need for high quality medical training and innovation in biomedical research. Currently, there are approximately 500 students enrolled in the M.D. program and about 105 postgraduate students. Aside from the medical doctor program, the School of Medicine also offers a joint M.D.-Ph.D. program with Houston Methodist Hospital, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas A&M Health Science Center, and other Bachelors in Nursing, Nutrition Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. The graduate medical education department offers several medical residency and fellowship programs. The general director of the TecSalud organization is Guillermo Torre M.D. PhD, a cardiologist who trained under Michael E. DeBakey MD at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\nAlthough some of the founding members of its faculty were prominent researchers (first rector Le\u00f3n \u00c1valos y Vez had formed a National Commission on Science and served as director-general of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute) formal research activities at the Tech did not start until 1951, when its Institute of Industrial Research was founded in close collaboration with the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas \u2014one of the oldest and largest independent, nonprofit, applied research and development organizations in the United States.Notwithstanding some reputable achievements, throughout most of the 20th century its research activities \u2014normally financed independently or under private sponsorship\u2014 were rather scarce in comparison to public universities such as the National Autonomous University of Mexico or the National Polytechnic Institute, whose budgets make up to 30% of the federal spending in higher education and, as such, are heavily financed by the government through the federal budget.Despite its inherent difficulties to secure research funds in a developing country where private sponsorship barely accounts for 1.1% of the national spending on science, a new institutional mission in 2005 made social and scientific research in Mexico's strategic areas one of its top priorities for the next decade. As a result, new corporate endowments and funds were committed, new research programs were created (including the first research program financed by Google in Latin America) and important labs and infrastructure have been built, such as the US$ 43 million Femsa Biotechnology Center, the Water Center for Latin America and the Caribbean (financed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Femsa Foundation), the Motorola Research and Development Center on Home & Networks Mobility, its MXN $24 million Center for Advanced Design at the Guadalajara Campus and, in association with the Mainz Institute of Microtechnology of Germany (IMM), the first center of chemical micro process engineering in Latin America.Additionally, the Institute developed a researcher-friendly patent scheme that aims to attract talented researchers and reduce the national brain drain. The scheme, in which the researcher may receive up to 30% of the patent licensing income, works in combination with its internal MXN$ 100,000 R\u00f3mulo Garza Prize and its national MXN$ 200,000 Luis Elizondo Prize and has allowed it to become the leading patent applicant among Mexican universities since 2006.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\nStudent life, traditions and activities vary among campuses. Generally speaking, student involvement is encouraged by the local campus through an office of student affairs and the Department of Leadership and Student Formation (LiFE), which supervises most of the student groups, sports teams, regional associations and its student federation (FETEC).\nThe Institute goes great lengths to provide scholarships to those in need, awarding partial financial assistance to 49% of its student population. However, with tuition fees of almost MXN $200,000 per academic year (among the highest in Latin America according to Forbes magazine) most of its student community comes from upper and upper-middle class and the overall atmosphere is arguably politically and socially conservative. For example, opposite-sex visits are forbidden in dormitories unless it is in common areas and some high school staff in the Mexico City Campus has publicly admonished students for questioning conservative politicians during school visits (although no disciplinary action was ever taken).The number of international students vary notably among campuses. As of December 2017, 4,714 foreign students were studying in one of its campuses while 10,618 Tech students were taking courses in a foreign university.\n\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nTec has a good record in college athletics, picking up over 18% of the medals at the 2007 national collegiate competition (Universiada) and one of its campuses won every American Football Collegiate Championship in Mexico (ONEFA) from 1998 to 2008. Such accomplishments were possible through the institute's investments in sports facilities and personnel and a well-funded and comprehensive athletic scholarships program, which attracted a significant number of promising athletes but prompted allegations of talent drain by some of its rivals. Before the 2009 season the Institute decided to part ways with the organization and create a new league; however, the league didn't materialize after other breakaway universities decided to remain in the ONEFA. The Institute asked to return to the organization, but the ONEFA Board decided that the request should be formally presented in its next ordinary meeting, after the 2009 season, which its four teams ended up playing between themselves in a Tech-only championship. For the 2010 season, the Institute decided not to participate in the ONEFA championship and, instead, asked the CONADEIP, a national athletic association of private educational institutions, to create an American football championship.Although there are local adaptations, since 1945 the system-wide sports mascot is the ram (borrego salvaje), traditionally embodied in a male bighorn sheep. A somewhat popular urban legend states that the mascot was chosen by the American football team on its way to a match, after spotting a male sheep on the road. According to the official sources, however, the mascot was chosen during an official contest held by students in the mid-1940s.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nFrom December 2006 to January 2009 both the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Mexican Secretary of Economy (former Kelloggs' CEO Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez and Gerardo Ruiz Mateos) were Tech alumni. Other businesspeople include Cemex'  CEO Lorenzo Zambrano, FEMSA's CEO Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez, Grupo Salinas' CEO Ricardo Salinas Pliego Max Appedole film producer, activist and Casa Cuervo's CEO Juan Beckman Dabook CEO Arisbeth Bernal Perez.\nIn science and technology, Alexander Balankin,  former lecturer at the Mexico City Campus, has received the 2005 UNESCO Science Prize for his works on Fractal Mechanics; Ernesto Enkerlin received UNESCO's 2005 Sultan Qaboos Prize for Environmental Preservation for his involvement in sustainability and two alumni have been members of the United States President's Information Technology Advisory Committee: Pedro Celis (Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft) and H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Molina, former Director of Stanford University's Computer Science Department, 1999 ACM SIGMOD Innovations Award and highest h-index in Computer Science.At least two late presidential candidates and democracy activists, Luis Donaldo Colosio and Manuel Clouthier, were former graduates. Over a dozen Mexican governors and cabinet members have attended classes at the Tech, including former Secretary of Commerce and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiator Herminio Blanco. In cultural affairs, Gabriel Zaid has distinguished himself as one of the leading Mexican intellectuals of the 20th century and in sports Fernando Platas and V\u00edctor Estrada have both won Olympics medals, while former coach of Mexico's national football team, Miguel Mej\u00eda Bar\u00f3n, is in charge of the Football Department at Puebla.As for staff and faculty, at least two rectors or directors of different universities have been lecturers or members of the staff at the Tech. Luis Ernesto Derbez, a former Foreign Minister, is currently the Rector of the University of the Americas, Puebla. Enrique Cabrero Mendoza is the current head of The National Council for Science and Technology and a former rector of CIDE. In addition, the Ex-Rector Rafael Rangel Sostmann is member of the External Advisory Council of the World Bank Institute.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education faculty\nList of Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education alumni\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years.

The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west.

In April and May 2011 temperatures reached 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of 50 cm (20 inches) in 8 hours occurred in January 1967. The most recent snowfall was in December 2004, on Christmas Eve. Sleet and ice events occurred in January 2007, December 2009, January and February 2010 and February 2011, caused by temperatures around \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F).\nFrom June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when Hurricane Alex delivered more than 584 millimetres (23 in) of rain in 72 hours, with areas reaching up to 1 metre (39 in) of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3\u20134 times as much rain as Hurricane Gilbert produced in the city on September 15, 1988.

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west. Their combined metropolitan population is over 4,080,329 people.Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. A small hill, the Cerro del Topo, and the smaller Topo Chico are in the suburbs of San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the Cerro de las Mitras (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their mitres.\nCerro de la Silla (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. Cerro de la Loma Larga\u2014South of the Santa Catarina river\u2014separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. At the summit of the Cerro del Obispado, north of the river, is the historic Bishopric Palace, site of one of the most important battles of the Mexican\u2013American War.\n\n\n=== Natural areas ===\n\nThe mountains surrounding Monterrey contain many canyons, trails and roads that cross deserts and forests. Suitable trails are available to the general public. The Sierra Madre Oriental mountains south of the city are included in the \"Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey\" (National Park), which was added to UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of Biosphere Reserves in 2006.Cumbres de Monterrey includes:\n\nParque Ecol\u00f3gico Chipinque, which contains forested areas (oak and oak-pine mainly).\nLa Estanzuela state park, about 7 km (4 mi) south of Monterrey, a river and forested area.\nLa Huasteca, west of the city, in the municipality of Santa Catarina.\nEl Potrero Chico Climbing Area, north east of the city, in the municipality of Hidalgo.\nGarcia Caves \u2013 these caves are situated in Garcia, Nuevo Leon and were discovered in 1843. Inside you can see amazing stalagmites formations and snail fossils.\nMatacanes \u2013 can be found in the municipality of Potrero Redondo in Santiago, Nuevo Leon. It is a 10 hrs walking tour in which you can find rappel descents, underground rivers, waterfalls, among other obstacles.\nHydrophobia Canyon \u2013 similar to Matacanes with the only difference this is a 100% aquatic area.\nCascade Cola de Caballo \u2013 a spectacular waterfall in Santiago Nuevo Leon, formed by water that runs down from the mountains of nearby Parque Nacional Cumbres de Monterrey, impressive rock formations and sprawling forests.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMonterrey has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSh). It is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico. Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing. The average high in August is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) and the average low is 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F). The average January high is 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) and the average low in January is 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.\nMonterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the northern winds in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September.

The city's economic wealth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.Industrialization was accelerated in the mid-19th century by the Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora de Fierro y Acero Monterrey, a steel-processing company. Today, Monterrey is home to transnational conglomerates such as Cemex (the world's third largest cement company), FEMSA (Coca-Cola Latin America, largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the world), Alfa (petrochemicals, food, telecommunications and auto parts), Axtel (telecommunications), Vitro (glass), Selther (leading mattress and rest systems firm in Latin America), Gruma (food), and Banorte (financial services).

Other local dishes and customs that perhaps date back to the Crypto-Judaism of Monterrey's founding families are the \"semita\" (bread without leavening), the capirotada dessert (a mix of cooked bread, cheese, raisins, peanuts, and crystallized sugarcane juice), and the relative absence of pork dishes. Another famous local dish is machacado con huevo.\nCarne asada on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and sausages or chopped as tacos. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. \"Glorias\" and \"obleas,\" made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo Le\u00f3n desserts.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMonterrey has two football teams in the Mexican league.

        "wiki": "The history of the Mexican city of Monterrey is closely linked with the history of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. When the New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n was founded, it included Monterrey, Monclova, Saltillo and Cerralvo. The founding families formed a group of about thirty people in each locality. Gradually, Nuevo Le\u00f3n was populated with families of nomadic herders of Spanish origin who fought and displaced the native indigenous groups in the region. The city was a step away from the border with the United States and it began to be a strategic location for industry and trade between the two countries. Originally isolated by the Sierra Madre and far from the center of New Spain and independent Mexico, in the late 19th century and throughout the twentieth century various demographic, social, political, and economic issues began to unfold.\n\n\n== First settlers ==\n\nThe first settlers were the Chichimecas. Current research has shown a culture of twelve thousand years old.\nThey were generally called Chichimecas to distinguish them from the larger and more powerful cultural groups of Middle America: the Mayan, Olmec, Zapotec, etc. It is said they were nomadic or semi-nomadic, not wandering aimlessly, but obeying regular movement patterns inside recognized territories; what anthropologists call territorial nomadism. They did not create large urban complexes like other peoples in central Mexico, the splendor of whom sometimes overshadowed them.  The Spanish settlers \"baptized\" them by erasing their original names.  Specialists have differentiated several linguistic nuclei between the tribes that inhabited the region but have failed to find a uniform approach, placing them in the family of the Athabascans, the Hokan or Macro-Yuma, subgroup Coahuilteco-Karankawa. Those who inhabited the region of what is now the city were called the  Aguaceros (\"heavy rains\") and the \"Malinche\u00f1os\".They lived in caves and river ravines where they left traces of their passage in paintings,  engravings, and movable items which  might have been amulets used in fertility rites or initiation of puberty, as well as mortars, hollowed stones and spearheads of all kinds ranging from those dating back millennia like those found in the municipality of Ramones with more than 11,000 thousand years of antiquity, to those used by the tribes of the Comanches in the 19th century. The density of prehistoric domestic waste found in the area confirms that there was a relatively large population, at least seasonally. Radiocarbon tests placed the earliest occupation in Boca de Potrerillos about 8000 years ago.Between 1960 and 1967, a group of archaeologists from the University of Texas at Austin headed by Jeremiah F. Epstein, undertook an extensive research program in the entire area.There is also an archaeological museum in the town of Mina and another in Linares created by Pablo Salce.\n\n\n== Sixteenth century: foundation of the City of Monterrey ==\n\n\n=== First settlement: Saint Lucia (1577). ===\n\nBorn in the Azores in 1547, Captain Alberto del Canto was commissioned by Martin Lopez de Ibarra to found the town of Santiago del Saltillo in 1577 but that same year he \"discovered\" (by geographical accident) the valley of Extremadura and practically just marked a place called Santa Lucia on which today is the center of modern-day Monterrey. He had no settlers that would stay so the place was abandoned as he headed to Saltillo, 75 km west.\n\n\n=== Second settlement: \"Villa de San Luis Rey de Francia\" (1582) ===\nIn 1567, the Portuguese Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva, from a family of New Christians, arrived in New Spain aboard a wine ship.  As mayor of Tampico, he was entrusted with the \"pacification\" of the Huasteca and participated in several campaigns of exploration. One of the most important was achieved with Francisco de Puga Valles and Zacatecas, where a route from there to Mazapil (Zacatecas) and New Galicia (most of the Southwest, near Guadalajara) was discovered in 1573.\nThe kings of Spain did not finance companies of discovery, but allowed the explorations to be made on behalf of the conquerors. Carvajal traveled to Spain and negotiated a contract with Felipe II of Spain in which he was awarded the pacification and population of a vast territory of \"200 leagues inland\"\u2014about 1,000 km.\nIn 1580 Carvajal's men, aboard the ship the Santa Catarina, joined the fleet in which the viceroy Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Mendoza, Count de La Coruna, was traveling.  Once in Veracruz, the Carvajal group continued on their own to the port of Tampico where they arrived on 25 August.\nCarvajal immediately took charge of his commitment. He spent long periods in Tamapache, Temptela, Xalpa and Sichu. On 12 April 1582, he founded the city of Leon -today called Cerralvo- and half a league from there founded another settlement which he called Villa de Cueva. That same year, in the old Saint Lucia, Carvajal founded the Villa de San Luis Rey de Francia. According to one chronicler, in these places there came to be as many as 200 men who undertook the capture of Indians thereby bringing more soldiers to the villages.\nTo govern these vast territories, in 1585 Carvajal named three lieutenants: Felipe Nu\u00f1o for the  Panuco region, Gaspar Casta\u00f1o de Sosa for the northeast and Diego de Montemayor for the center, from Santa Lucia to Laguna. At that time, the count of the Coru\u00f1a began a legal process against Carvajal accusing him  of invading territories that were not his. Carvajal asked for  and was granted protection by Pedro de Vega, solicitor of the Royal Court, on 18 January 1582. The resentment of the Viceroy turned into a struggle without quarter against Carvajal who could no longer continue his government.\nWhile Carvajal was in Mexico, his nephew, Luis de Carvajal the Younger, took over the duties of governor. But then violent clashes which arose between Indians and conquerors resulted in the depopulation of the town of San Luis. The city of Leon and the town of Cave suffered a similar fate.  Finally Diego de Montemayor  decided to leave his territory. He and the few neighbors who were gathered in San Francisco (Apodaca)  departed for Saltillo.\nMeanwhile, around 1588 Luis de Carvajal managed to get released and undertook the task of repopulating the mines of Trinidad, which he called New Almaden -Monclova- and appointed  Diego de Montemayor  lieutenant governor of Coahuila with jurisdiction over St. Lucia extending to the Parras and from the Rio Grande to Lagua.   With this appointment he gave him the task of  repopulating the city of Leon as well as las Parras. But Carvajal's problems were not over.\nReligion and government during that era were considered the same thing.    The charges against Carvajal that he had invaded foreign territory weighed heavily against him.  That he belonged to a family of New Christians was held against him and he ended up being excommunicated. He was arrested by Alonso L\u00f3pez and taken back to Mexico for trial by the Inquisition. His  excommunication was withdrawn after abjuring, but he was sentenced to exile for 6 years, a term he did not complete because shortly afterwards he died in prison.\nGaspar de Sosa, who had been  Caraval's lieutenant in Almaden,  left the region and went to New Mexico, which earned him banishment to China where he died. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n was again deserted.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan city of Our Lady of Monterrey (20 September 1596) ===\n\nIt was proving difficult to establish this new kingdom of Leon, where so many previous attempts had failed. Diego de Montemayor, who had been appointed lieutenant by Carvajal returned after eight years of absence and established  the Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey where  Saint Lucia and the failed Villa of San Luis King of France had been.\nAlthough his abandonment of the settlement, years earlier, could have invalidated the claims of Carvajal on Montemayor and any consequent privileges, this did not happen. Years later, on 11 February 1599, Montemayor was given title to the region by the same Viceroy after the Viceroy had consulted  Spain, ruler of the Kingdom.\n\n\n== Seventeenth century: colonial period ==\n\n\n=== Early years.  Seventeenth century ===\n\nBut this Kingdom was only that in name. The first few people-about 34, including children  -had to go through many hardships, eating burdock offered them by the  springs of water, raising small livestock and farming. Their houses were made of adobe and everything  built was gradually destroyed by the rains and floods of 1611. With the death of Montemayor, his son Diego replaced him in office but died the following year. The viceroy then appointed Lieutenant General Agustin de Zavala. He was a rich Zacatecas miner and managed the city through magistrates.  Successively these magistrates were Cristobal de Irurrea, Diego Rodriguez and Alonso Lucas el Bueno.\nAfter the floods of 1611, the people again began  to build the city, this time in a slightly higher place (Plaza Zaragoza), where   general Zavala maintained for more than 10 years a flour store, seeds and other supplies to distribute to the families. He also continued  pacification campaigns and established a military detachment under the command of Hernando Huarte de la Concha.\nThis small kingdom already had a convent by 1602 under the patronage of San Andr\u00e9s and after the floods of 1611 was moved to its new site in 1626 where it  had a cemetery, cell  tower and bells. The work of the church here was decisive in the  so-called  \"pacification\" of the local native peoples (actually the goal was to enslave them  and use them as labor) : the Bozalos in Matehuala, the Gualaguises in San Cristobal (Hualahuises ), the Janambres in San Antonio de los Llanos.  In addition, in the  early seventeenth century the following missions were established: Santa Maria degli Angeli White River (Aramberri), Santa Teresa del Alamo (1659), San Nicolas de Gualeguas (1672) and others in the north of the kingdom and in southern Texas. the convents of Our Lady of Conception (in Cerralvo 1630) and San Lorenzo (in Cadereyta around 1640) were also established.\n\n\n=== Los tlaxcaltecas ===\n\n\n=== Haciendas y Pastores ===\n\n\n=== Feudal lords ===\nAs in other regions of New Spain, in the New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n there was a society differentiated between gentlemen, soldiers, miners, etc. Each of these social groups played their particular role. Among the personalities of rank were, of course, governors and lieutenants, but along with them, the families of the founders, whose power increased if they also had large resources or mercedes-large tracts of land, Indians, cattle, servants, slaves, etc. granted by the Crown. In the seventeenth century, among the most outstanding personalities was Bernab\u00e9 de las Casas,  owner of an immense estate that began in the northeast of Monterrey and reached the present limits of Colima. The division of his land  among his heirs  gave rise to the haciendas of San Francisco de las Canas, the Pueblito, Chipinque and Our Lady of Guide (or Egu\u00eda), which  in the nineteenth century would become the villages of Mina, Hidalgo, El Carmen and Abasolo, respectively.\nThe colonial era of Monterrey was characterized by the constant struggle for power over  land. The vast majority of its population was in the military, in service to the King.  They gathered in the main square, which was named  the Plaza de Armas,  because from there they set out to battle and congregated twice a year,  on 25 July and  25 November.\n\n\n== Eighteenth century ==\n\n\n=== Monterrey religious establishments ===\n\nThe second bishop, Rafael Jos\u00e9 Verger requested that the headquarters be in Monterrey and not in Saltillo or M\u00fazquiz as Teodoro de Croix, the commander of the internal provinces of that era,  wanted.  Velanger built his residence -the current bishopric- in the Loma de la Chepevera and wanted the cathedral to be in  that area as well.  This did not take place.  Finally the king issued the order for the ecclesiastical council to be based in Monterrey in 1789, and on 10 November 1792,   a bishopric  was established in  the city of Monterrey under bishop Andr\u00e9s Ambrosio de Llanos and Vald\u00e9s. This brought in  the architect Juan Crouset in 1794 for a project to expand the city and construct a  new cathedral, but the project was left unfinished because of the opposition of the governor.\n\n\n== Nineteenth century ==\n\n\n=== Mexican independence ===\nWhen the news that Miguel Hidalgo had risen in arms against the Spanish power came to Monterrey, the governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Santa Maria,  sent the commander Juan Ignacio Ram\u00f3n south to contain the insurgents.  Rather than contain the insurgency, Ramon quickly joined the insurgent group led by Mariano Jimenez. Santa Maria also ended up joining the independence movement.\nFrom Saltillo, Jimenez sent  Juan Bautista Carrasco and Ignacio Camargo to Monterey to control the northern populations. On 26 January 1811, he arrived in Monterrey where he was received with jubilation. There he appointed governor  Jose Santiago Villareal and returned to Saltillo on hearing of the defeat of Hidalgo. A counterrevolutionary group formed in Texas ended up shooting Santa Maria and Juan Ignacio Ram\u00f3n. Upon their death, the  Monterrey Governing Board was established, chaired by Blas Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez (1813).  Guerrilla activity, headed by Jos\u00e9 Herrera, Pedro Baez Trevi\u00f1o, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sada and many other insurgents, remained constant during the Revolutionary Era.  On 3 July 1821 Gaspar L\u00f3pez, governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, proclaimed  adherence to the Plan of Iguala and  the Independence of  Moneterrey.\n\n\n=== Fray Servando Teresa de Mier ===\n\n\n=== Battle of Monterrey ===\n\nAfter the country's independence from the Spanish Crown and the foundation of Mexico in 1821, the governments of Mexico and the United States fought the Mexican-American War, which resulted in the loss of more than half of Mexico's national territory. On 23 September 1846 General William J. Worth besieged the city and a battle between the two countries was fought from Cerro del Obispado to the Villa de Guadalupe, known as the Battle of Monterrey. American troops remained in the Mexican territory until 1848 and the Mexico-American War ended with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in which the conflicting parties agreed that the United States would acquire the territories of Alta California and New Mexico, and the territory  between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, claimed by the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n=== The fight for power \u2013 Santiago Vidaurri ===\n\n\n=== The Civil College ===\n\n\n== Porfiriato ==\n\n\n=== Bernardo Reyes ===\n\n\n== Twentieth century ==\n\n\n=== Mexican Revolution ===\n\nDissatisfaction with the extensive and dictatorial rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz was widespread in Mexico in the early twentieth century. Around 1900 Reyes traveled to Mexico City to replace the Minister of War. Having been absent from Monterrey for two years, the anti-government groups became more visible, especially those derived from students in law school. In 1902,  Reyes returned to  Monterrey  to fulfill his  mandate as governor of the state, and with the support of Diaz, began campaigning for re-election. The opposition then began acting more forcefully. In addition to the editorials that they had been publishing for years, they also  published manifestos in favor of individual  rights and free elections,  and against dictatorship.\nOn 2 April 1903, a date when the  nation celebrated the triumph of Porfirio D\u00edaz, the supporters of  Reyes gathered in  Zaragoza square to hear the governor's speech. But, at the same time,  the opposition consisting of supporters of the Great Electoral State Convention, gathered in the Alameda.  Confrontation between the two groups proved fatal.  By the end of the day,  eight were dead and 70 wounded,   and a hundred  prominent supporters of the convention were imprisoned.\nAfter the storm came the calm. Reyes took power for the fourth time.  His popularity grew in the country and he was seen as the ideal candidate to replace Diaz. Porfirio once again introduced his candidacy as president, and Ram\u00f3n Corral was chosen as vice president .  The popularity of Reyes at the national level was seen as a threat to the plans of Diaz.\nA natural disaster in Monterrey was preamble to the disaster that the Mexican Revolution meant for the Diaz regime. On 28 August 1909 the Santa Catarina River overflowed its banks, causing the worst disaster in\nhistory of the city. \"The victims numbered in the thousands and the material damages were incalculable.\" A few months later Reyes was removed from the national political scene. when Diaz sent him to Europe on a supposed military mission.\nThe atmosphere in the country was tumultuous in  the first two decades of the twentieth century.  Battles intensified after the death of President Francisco I. Madero. Dissatisfaction with the regime of Victoriano Huerta by many sectors of the country led  Venustiano Carranza to ignore the Huerta government with the Plan of Guadalupe of 1913 and  start a constitutionalist revolution.\nOn 23 October 1913, the carrancistas forces under the command of General Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, Jesus Carranza and Antonio I. Villarreal came to Monterrey. They organized into squads and  took over a bishopric, while others occupied the barracks on the corner of Madero and Corona streets, where the school is now. Other revolutionaries came to the Alameda and invaded the prison, which was in Pino Suarez, between Arramberri and Espinoza. Although the federal forces were entrenched in the markets,  the revolutionary forces managed to overtake them and capture the Villa de Guadalupe. That same day the insurgent forces reached Mina Street, Gulf Station, where they established their cuartel-. In the smelter they tried to approach the Government palace and arrived at the southern end  of the Santa Catarina (San Luisito) river.\n\n\n=== Constitutionalist government ===\n\nThe turbulence of the revolution not only resulted in the Constitution of 1917, but in Monterrey and throughout the state led to banditry, which had to be controlled by the first constitutional government of Nic\u00e9foro Zambrano. Following the revolution there was also an outbreak of  Spanish influenza that, in the city alone, killed 717 people.\n\n\n=== Urban and cultural expansion ===\n\nThe state government created the institutions of Fornerrey and Provileon to help poor people with housing problems.  During the 60's the city began to grow vertically with the creation of the Acero Condominiums and the Constitucion Apartments.\nThe metropolitan area extended its perimeters, invading the municipalities of  Guadalupe, Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina, San Nicol\u00e1s, General Escobedo, Apodaca, etc.\nIn the 1930s, the city began to develop culturally.  In 1933  the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL) was established, followed by the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM). ten years alter.  Not long after that, the Ciudad Universitaria y el Campus del Tec was established.\n\n\n=== Macroplaza ===\n\nThe Legislative Palace, the City Theater, The  Department of Education and Culture, the State  Treasury, Administrative Tower, Central Library, the Infonativit Building, the State Archives, and the Superior Court (built later by Governor Jorge A Trevino)  were all constructed in the Macroplaza area.\nArtistic works in the Marcroplaza include \"The Fountain of Life\" , and the sculptures \"Escobedo\", \"Hidalgo\", and \"Morelos\" by Luis Sanguino,   the Faro de Comercio by Luis Barragan, and \"Homage to the Sun\" by Rufino Tamayo,  There are also sculptures by  Fidias Elizondo, Federico Cant\u00fa and other artists. In the  Esplanade of the Heroes, which is part of the  Macroplaza, the remains of some of the governors of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are conserved, including  Juan Zuazua, Antonio I. Villarreal, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, J. Silvestre Arramberri y Bernardo Reyes.\n\n\n=== Parque Fundidora ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Monterrey, Mexico\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nCavazos Garza, Israel Breve historia de Nuevo Le\u00f3n Publicado por Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, M\u00e9xico 1994 231 p\u00e1ginas Digitalizado el 18 March 2008.

        "wiki": "Monterrey (; Spanish pronunciation: [monte\u02c8rej] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The city is anchor to the Monterrey metropolitan area, the second most productive in Mexico with a GDP (PPP) of US$123 billion, and the third largest with an estimated population of 4,689,601 people as of 2015. Monterrey is one of the most livable cities in Mexico, and a 2018 study found that suburb San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda is the city with the best quality of life in Mexico. It serves as a commercial center of northern Mexico and is the base of many significant international corporations. Its purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP per capita is considerably higher than the rest of Mexico's at around US$35,500, compared to the country's US$18,800. It is considered a Beta World City, cosmopolitan and competitive. Rich in history and culture, it is one of the most developed cities in Mexico.As an important industrial and business center, the city is also home to many Mexican companies, including Grupo Avante, Lanix Electronics, Ocresa, CEMEX, Vitro, OXXO, FEMSA, DINA S.A., Gamesa, Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma Brewery, and Grupo ALFA. Monterrey is also home to international companies such as Cognizant, Siemens, Accenture, MSCI, Ternium, Sony, Toshiba, Carrier, Whirlpool, Samsung, Toyota, Babcock & Wilcox, Daewoo, British American Tobacco, Nokia, Dell, Boeing, HTC, General Electric, Johnson Controls, LG, SAS Institute, Grundfos, Danfoss, Qualfon and Teleperformance, among others.Monterrey is in northeastern Mexico, at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by Diego de Montemayor in 1596. In the years after the Mexican War of Independence, Monterrey became an important business center. With the establishment of Fundidora Monterrey, the city has experienced great industrial growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehispanic history ===\nBefore the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous semi-nomadic groups. Carved stone and cave painting in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: Azalapas, Huachichiles, Coahuiltecos and Borrados.\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nIn the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the Extremadura Valley, an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador Alberto del Canto, who named the city Santa Lucia, but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva negotiated with King Philip II of Spain to establish a territory in northern New Spain that would be called Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\". In 1580 he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called San Luis Rey de Francia (named for Saint Louis IX of France) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n extended westward from the port of Tampico to the limits of Nueva Vizcaya (\"New Biscay\", now State of Chihuahua), and around 1,000 kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo Le\u00f3n was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador Diego de Montemayor founded Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Monterrey (\"Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey\") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia, where the Museum of Mexican History and Santa Luc\u00eda riverwalk are now. The new city's name was chosen to honor the wife of Gaspar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 5th Count of Monterrey, ninth Viceroy of New Spain.\nMonterrey's Coat of Arms shows an Indian throwing an arrow to the sun in front of Cerro de la Silla mountain. This represents a native ceremony performed at sunrise.\n\nDuring the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between San Antonio (now in Texas), Tampico and from Saltillo to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, Mexico City. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).\n\n\n=== After Mexican Independence (19th century) ===\nIn the 19th century, after the Mexican Independence War, Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the \"New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n\" became the State of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed Coahuila and Tamaulipas states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre as it did before in 1840 for the Republic of the Rio Grande.\nIn 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the Mexican\u2013American War took place in the city, known as the Battle of Monterrey. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center.\nMany of the generals in the Mexican War against France were natives of the city, including Mariano Escobedo, Juan Zuazua (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and Jer\u00f3nimo Trevi\u00f1o.\n\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n\nDuring the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that Jos\u00e9 Eleuterio Gonz\u00e1lez founded the University Hospital, now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL). Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. The brewery Cervecer\u00eda Cuauthemoc, one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890. A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 1988, Hurricane Gilbert caused great damage to the city; the Santa Catarina River overflowed, causing about 100 deaths and economic damage.\nThe city has hosted international events such as the 2002 United Nations Conference on Financing for Development with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus, which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the OAS Special Summit of the Americas was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.\nIn 2007, Monterrey held the Universal Forum of Cultures, with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, Hurricane Alex. Alex was considered worse than Hurricane Gilbert, with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the Nuevo Le\u00f3n Development Plan 2030 was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.In August 2011 the city was the scene of a terror attack on a casino, in which more than 50 people were killed.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nMonterrey and its metropolitan area are municipalities governed by a democratically elected Presidente Municipal (Municipal President), or mayor, for a period of three years. The political environment is one of civility and in the last decade political parties have been alternating office. The current mayor of Monterrey is Adrian De la Garza Santos.\nThe City Council of Monterrey (Cabildo de Monterrey) is an organ integrated by the mayor, the Regidores and the S\u00edndicos. The mayor is the executor of the determinations of the City Council and the person directly in charge of public municipal administration. The Regidores represent the community and collectively define city policies. The S\u00edndicos are in charge of watching and legally defending city interests, as well as of monitoring the treasury and the municipal patrimony.The political parties with representation in the city are the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI, the National Action Party or PAN, the Party of the Democratic Revolution or PRD, the Labor Party or PT, the Green Party, Citizens\u00b4 Movement, Socialdemocratic Party and Nueva Alianza.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nIn 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico, and one of the two safest in 2006. But since 2008 it has experienced violence related to turf battles between warring drug cartels. The year 2011 was the most violent in history. Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city. The city is safe to travel by day and night.There are two police departments in the city, the Police of the City of Monterrey (locally known as the Polic\u00eda Regia), dependent on the municipal government, and the State Public Safety. The Polic\u00eda Regia protects the city's downtown and main areas, while the State Public Safety is in charge of remoter areas. Since the 2011 attack on the Casino Royale, security has been reinforced by military and federal police.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city of Monterrey is 540 metres (1,770 ft) above sea level in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Monterrey translated from Spanish to English is \"King Mount\" or \"King mountain\", which refers to the city's topography and the large mountains that surround it. The Santa Catarina River\u2014dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water\u2014bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the San Juan River and Rio Grande.\nMonterrey is adjacent to San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Garc\u00eda and General Escobedo to the north; Guadalupe, Ju\u00e1rez and Cadereyta Jim\u00e9nez to the east; Santiago to the south; and San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda and Santa Catarina to the west.

        "wiki": "The history of the Mexican city of Monterrey is closely linked with the history of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. When the New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n was founded, it included Monterrey, Monclova, Saltillo and Cerralvo. The founding families formed a group of about thirty people in each locality. Gradually, Nuevo Le\u00f3n was populated with families of nomadic herders of Spanish origin who fought and displaced the native indigenous groups in the region. The city was a step away from the border with the United States and it began to be a strategic location for industry and trade between the two countries. Originally isolated by the Sierra Madre and far from the center of New Spain and independent Mexico, in the late 19th century and throughout the twentieth century various demographic, social, political, and economic issues began to unfold.\n\n\n== First settlers ==\n\nThe first settlers were the Chichimecas. Current research has shown a culture of twelve thousand years old.\nThey were generally called Chichimecas to distinguish them from the larger and more powerful cultural groups of Middle America: the Mayan, Olmec, Zapotec, etc. It is said they were nomadic or semi-nomadic, not wandering aimlessly, but obeying regular movement patterns inside recognized territories; what anthropologists call territorial nomadism. They did not create large urban complexes like other peoples in central Mexico, the splendor of whom sometimes overshadowed them.  The Spanish settlers \"baptized\" them by erasing their original names.  Specialists have differentiated several linguistic nuclei between the tribes that inhabited the region but have failed to find a uniform approach, placing them in the family of the Athabascans, the Hokan or Macro-Yuma, subgroup Coahuilteco-Karankawa. Those who inhabited the region of what is now the city were called the  Aguaceros (\"heavy rains\") and the \"Malinche\u00f1os\".They lived in caves and river ravines where they left traces of their passage in paintings,  engravings, and movable items which  might have been amulets used in fertility rites or initiation of puberty, as well as mortars, hollowed stones and spearheads of all kinds ranging from those dating back millennia like those found in the municipality of Ramones with more than 11,000 thousand years of antiquity, to those used by the tribes of the Comanches in the 19th century. The density of prehistoric domestic waste found in the area confirms that there was a relatively large population, at least seasonally. Radiocarbon tests placed the earliest occupation in Boca de Potrerillos about 8000 years ago.Between 1960 and 1967, a group of archaeologists from the University of Texas at Austin headed by Jeremiah F. Epstein, undertook an extensive research program in the entire area.There is also an archaeological museum in the town of Mina and another in Linares created by Pablo Salce.\n\n\n== Sixteenth century: foundation of the City of Monterrey ==\n\n\n=== First settlement: Saint Lucia (1577). ===\n\nBorn in the Azores in 1547, Captain Alberto del Canto was commissioned by Martin Lopez de Ibarra to found the town of Santiago del Saltillo in 1577 but that same year he \"discovered\" (by geographical accident) the valley of Extremadura and practically just marked a place called Santa Lucia on which today is the center of modern-day Monterrey. He had no settlers that would stay so the place was abandoned as he headed to Saltillo, 75 km west.\n\n\n=== Second settlement: \"Villa de San Luis Rey de Francia\" (1582) ===\nIn 1567, the Portuguese Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva, from a family of New Christians, arrived in New Spain aboard a wine ship.  As mayor of Tampico, he was entrusted with the \"pacification\" of the Huasteca and participated in several campaigns of exploration. One of the most important was achieved with Francisco de Puga Valles and Zacatecas, where a route from there to Mazapil (Zacatecas) and New Galicia (most of the Southwest, near Guadalajara) was discovered in 1573.\nThe kings of Spain did not finance companies of discovery, but allowed the explorations to be made on behalf of the conquerors. Carvajal traveled to Spain and negotiated a contract with Felipe II of Spain in which he was awarded the pacification and population of a vast territory of \"200 leagues inland\"\u2014about 1,000 km.\nIn 1580 Carvajal's men, aboard the ship the Santa Catarina, joined the fleet in which the viceroy Lorenzo Su\u00e1rez de Mendoza, Count de La Coruna, was traveling.  Once in Veracruz, the Carvajal group continued on their own to the port of Tampico where they arrived on 25 August.\nCarvajal immediately took charge of his commitment. He spent long periods in Tamapache, Temptela, Xalpa and Sichu. On 12 April 1582, he founded the city of Leon -today called Cerralvo- and half a league from there founded another settlement which he called Villa de Cueva. That same year, in the old Saint Lucia, Carvajal founded the Villa de San Luis Rey de Francia. According to one chronicler, in these places there came to be as many as 200 men who undertook the capture of Indians thereby bringing more soldiers to the villages.\nTo govern these vast territories, in 1585 Carvajal named three lieutenants: Felipe Nu\u00f1o for the  Panuco region, Gaspar Casta\u00f1o de Sosa for the northeast and Diego de Montemayor for the center, from Santa Lucia to Laguna. At that time, the count of the Coru\u00f1a began a legal process against Carvajal accusing him  of invading territories that were not his. Carvajal asked for  and was granted protection by Pedro de Vega, solicitor of the Royal Court, on 18 January 1582. The resentment of the Viceroy turned into a struggle without quarter against Carvajal who could no longer continue his government.\nWhile Carvajal was in Mexico, his nephew, Luis de Carvajal the Younger, took over the duties of governor. But then violent clashes which arose between Indians and conquerors resulted in the depopulation of the town of San Luis. The city of Leon and the town of Cave suffered a similar fate.  Finally Diego de Montemayor  decided to leave his territory. He and the few neighbors who were gathered in San Francisco (Apodaca)  departed for Saltillo.\nMeanwhile, around 1588 Luis de Carvajal managed to get released and undertook the task of repopulating the mines of Trinidad, which he called New Almaden -Monclova- and appointed  Diego de Montemayor  lieutenant governor of Coahuila with jurisdiction over St. Lucia extending to the Parras and from the Rio Grande to Lagua.   With this appointment he gave him the task of  repopulating the city of Leon as well as las Parras. But Carvajal's problems were not over.\nReligion and government during that era were considered the same thing.    The charges against Carvajal that he had invaded foreign territory weighed heavily against him.  That he belonged to a family of New Christians was held against him and he ended up being excommunicated. He was arrested by Alonso L\u00f3pez and taken back to Mexico for trial by the Inquisition. His  excommunication was withdrawn after abjuring, but he was sentenced to exile for 6 years, a term he did not complete because shortly afterwards he died in prison.\nGaspar de Sosa, who had been  Caraval's lieutenant in Almaden,  left the region and went to New Mexico, which earned him banishment to China where he died. The New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n was again deserted.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan city of Our Lady of Monterrey (20 September 1596) ===\n\nIt was proving difficult to establish this new kingdom of Leon, where so many previous attempts had failed. Diego de Montemayor, who had been appointed lieutenant by Carvajal returned after eight years of absence and established  the Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey where  Saint Lucia and the failed Villa of San Luis King of France had been.\nAlthough his abandonment of the settlement, years earlier, could have invalidated the claims of Carvajal on Montemayor and any consequent privileges, this did not happen. Years later, on 11 February 1599, Montemayor was given title to the region by the same Viceroy after the Viceroy had consulted  Spain, ruler of the Kingdom.\n\n\n== Seventeenth century: colonial period ==\n\n\n=== Early years.  Seventeenth century ===\n\nBut this Kingdom was only that in name. The first few people-about 34, including children  -had to go through many hardships, eating burdock offered them by the  springs of water, raising small livestock and farming. Their houses were made of adobe and everything  built was gradually destroyed by the rains and floods of 1611. With the death of Montemayor, his son Diego replaced him in office but died the following year. The viceroy then appointed Lieutenant General Agustin de Zavala. He was a rich Zacatecas miner and managed the city through magistrates.  Successively these magistrates were Cristobal de Irurrea, Diego Rodriguez and Alonso Lucas el Bueno.\nAfter the floods of 1611, the people again began  to build the city, this time in a slightly higher place (Plaza Zaragoza), where   general Zavala maintained for more than 10 years a flour store, seeds and other supplies to distribute to the families. He also continued  pacification campaigns and established a military detachment under the command of Hernando Huarte de la Concha.\nThis small kingdom already had a convent by 1602 under the patronage of San Andr\u00e9s and after the floods of 1611 was moved to its new site in 1626 where it  had a cemetery, cell  tower and bells. The work of the church here was decisive in the  so-called  \"pacification\" of the local native peoples (actually the goal was to enslave them  and use them as labor) : the Bozalos in Matehuala, the Gualaguises in San Cristobal (Hualahuises ), the Janambres in San Antonio de los Llanos.  In addition, in the  early seventeenth century the following missions were established: Santa Maria degli Angeli White River (Aramberri), Santa Teresa del Alamo (1659), San Nicolas de Gualeguas (1672) and others in the north of the kingdom and in southern Texas. the convents of Our Lady of Conception (in Cerralvo 1630) and San Lorenzo (in Cadereyta around 1640) were also established.\n\n\n=== Los tlaxcaltecas ===\n\n\n=== Haciendas y Pastores ===\n\n\n=== Feudal lords ===\nAs in other regions of New Spain, in the New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n there was a society differentiated between gentlemen, soldiers, miners, etc. Each of these social groups played their particular role. Among the personalities of rank were, of course, governors and lieutenants, but along with them, the families of the founders, whose power increased if they also had large resources or mercedes-large tracts of land, Indians, cattle, servants, slaves, etc. granted by the Crown. In the seventeenth century, among the most outstanding personalities was Bernab\u00e9 de las Casas,  owner of an immense estate that began in the northeast of Monterrey and reached the present limits of Colima. The division of his land  among his heirs  gave rise to the haciendas of San Francisco de las Canas, the Pueblito, Chipinque and Our Lady of Guide (or Egu\u00eda), which  in the nineteenth century would become the villages of Mina, Hidalgo, El Carmen and Abasolo, respectively.\nThe colonial era of Monterrey was characterized by the constant struggle for power over  land. The vast majority of its population was in the military, in service to the King.  They gathered in the main square, which was named  the Plaza de Armas,  because from there they set out to battle and congregated twice a year,  on 25 July and  25 November.\n\n\n== Eighteenth century ==\n\n\n=== Monterrey religious establishments ===\n\nThe second bishop, Rafael Jos\u00e9 Verger requested that the headquarters be in Monterrey and not in Saltillo or M\u00fazquiz as Teodoro de Croix, the commander of the internal provinces of that era,  wanted.  Velanger built his residence -the current bishopric- in the Loma de la Chepevera and wanted the cathedral to be in  that area as well.  This did not take place.  Finally the king issued the order for the ecclesiastical council to be based in Monterrey in 1789, and on 10 November 1792,   a bishopric  was established in  the city of Monterrey under bishop Andr\u00e9s Ambrosio de Llanos and Vald\u00e9s. This brought in  the architect Juan Crouset in 1794 for a project to expand the city and construct a  new cathedral, but the project was left unfinished because of the opposition of the governor.\n\n\n== Nineteenth century ==\n\n\n=== Mexican independence ===\nWhen the news that Miguel Hidalgo had risen in arms against the Spanish power came to Monterrey, the governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Santa Maria,  sent the commander Juan Ignacio Ram\u00f3n south to contain the insurgents.  Rather than contain the insurgency, Ramon quickly joined the insurgent group led by Mariano Jimenez. Santa Maria also ended up joining the independence movement.\nFrom Saltillo, Jimenez sent  Juan Bautista Carrasco and Ignacio Camargo to Monterey to control the northern populations. On 26 January 1811, he arrived in Monterrey where he was received with jubilation. There he appointed governor  Jose Santiago Villareal and returned to Saltillo on hearing of the defeat of Hidalgo. A counterrevolutionary group formed in Texas ended up shooting Santa Maria and Juan Ignacio Ram\u00f3n. Upon their death, the  Monterrey Governing Board was established, chaired by Blas Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez (1813).  Guerrilla activity, headed by Jos\u00e9 Herrera, Pedro Baez Trevi\u00f1o, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sada and many other insurgents, remained constant during the Revolutionary Era.  On 3 July 1821 Gaspar L\u00f3pez, governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, proclaimed  adherence to the Plan of Iguala and  the Independence of  Moneterrey.\n\n\n=== Fray Servando Teresa de Mier ===\n\n\n=== Battle of Monterrey ===\n\nAfter the country's independence from the Spanish Crown and the foundation of Mexico in 1821, the governments of Mexico and the United States fought the Mexican-American War, which resulted in the loss of more than half of Mexico's national territory. On 23 September 1846 General William J. Worth besieged the city and a battle between the two countries was fought from Cerro del Obispado to the Villa de Guadalupe, known as the Battle of Monterrey. American troops remained in the Mexican territory until 1848 and the Mexico-American War ended with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in which the conflicting parties agreed that the United States would acquire the territories of Alta California and New Mexico, and the territory  between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande, claimed by the Republic of Texas.\n\n\n=== The fight for power \u2013 Santiago Vidaurri ===\n\n\n=== The Civil College ===\n\n\n== Porfiriato ==\n\n\n=== Bernardo Reyes ===\n\n\n== Twentieth century ==\n\n\n=== Mexican Revolution ===\n\nDissatisfaction with the extensive and dictatorial rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz was widespread in Mexico in the early twentieth century. Around 1900 Reyes traveled to Mexico City to replace the Minister of War. Having been absent from Monterrey for two years, the anti-government groups became more visible, especially those derived from students in law school. In 1902,  Reyes returned to  Monterrey  to fulfill his  mandate as governor of the state, and with the support of Diaz, began campaigning for re-election. The opposition then began acting more forcefully. In addition to the editorials that they had been publishing for years, they also  published manifestos in favor of individual  rights and free elections,  and against dictatorship.\nOn 2 April 1903, a date when the  nation celebrated the triumph of Porfirio D\u00edaz, the supporters of  Reyes gathered in  Zaragoza square to hear the governor's speech. But, at the same time,  the opposition consisting of supporters of the Great Electoral State Convention, gathered in the Alameda.  Confrontation between the two groups proved fatal.  By the end of the day,  eight were dead and 70 wounded,   and a hundred  prominent supporters of the convention were imprisoned.\nAfter the storm came the calm. Reyes took power for the fourth time.  His popularity grew in the country and he was seen as the ideal candidate to replace Diaz. Porfirio once again introduced his candidacy as president, and Ram\u00f3n Corral was chosen as vice president .  The popularity of Reyes at the national level was seen as a threat to the plans of Diaz.\nA natural disaster in Monterrey was preamble to the disaster that the Mexican Revolution meant for the Diaz regime. On 28 August 1909 the Santa Catarina River overflowed its banks, causing the worst disaster in\nhistory of the city. \"The victims numbered in the thousands and the material damages were incalculable.\" A few months later Reyes was removed from the national political scene. when Diaz sent him to Europe on a supposed military mission.\nThe atmosphere in the country was tumultuous in  the first two decades of the twentieth century.  Battles intensified after the death of President Francisco I. Madero. Dissatisfaction with the regime of Victoriano Huerta by many sectors of the country led  Venustiano Carranza to ignore the Huerta government with the Plan of Guadalupe of 1913 and  start a constitutionalist revolution.\nOn 23 October 1913, the carrancistas forces under the command of General Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, Jesus Carranza and Antonio I. Villarreal came to Monterrey. They organized into squads and  took over a bishopric, while others occupied the barracks on the corner of Madero and Corona streets, where the school is now. Other revolutionaries came to the Alameda and invaded the prison, which was in Pino Suarez, between Arramberri and Espinoza. Although the federal forces were entrenched in the markets,  the revolutionary forces managed to overtake them and capture the Villa de Guadalupe. That same day the insurgent forces reached Mina Street, Gulf Station, where they established their cuartel-. In the smelter they tried to approach the Government palace and arrived at the southern end  of the Santa Catarina (San Luisito) river.\n\n\n=== Constitutionalist government ===\n\nThe turbulence of the revolution not only resulted in the Constitution of 1917, but in Monterrey and throughout the state led to banditry, which had to be controlled by the first constitutional government of Nic\u00e9foro Zambrano. Following the revolution there was also an outbreak of  Spanish influenza that, in the city alone, killed 717 people.\n\n\n=== Urban and cultural expansion ===\n\nThe state government created the institutions of Fornerrey and Provileon to help poor people with housing problems.  During the 60's the city began to grow vertically with the creation of the Acero Condominiums and the Constitucion Apartments.\nThe metropolitan area extended its perimeters, invading the municipalities of  Guadalupe, Garza Garc\u00eda, Santa Catarina, San Nicol\u00e1s, General Escobedo, Apodaca, etc.\nIn the 1930s, the city began to develop culturally.  In 1933  the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL) was established, followed by the Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM). ten years alter.  Not long after that, the Ciudad Universitaria y el Campus del Tec was established.\n\n\n=== Macroplaza ===\n\nThe Legislative Palace, the City Theater, The  Department of Education and Culture, the State  Treasury, Administrative Tower, Central Library, the Infonativit Building, the State Archives, and the Superior Court (built later by Governor Jorge A Trevino)  were all constructed in the Macroplaza area.\nArtistic works in the Marcroplaza include \"The Fountain of Life\" , and the sculptures \"Escobedo\", \"Hidalgo\", and \"Morelos\" by Luis Sanguino,   the Faro de Comercio by Luis Barragan, and \"Homage to the Sun\" by Rufino Tamayo,  There are also sculptures by  Fidias Elizondo, Federico Cant\u00fa and other artists. In the  Esplanade of the Heroes, which is part of the  Macroplaza, the remains of some of the governors of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are conserved, including  Juan Zuazua, Antonio I. Villarreal, Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez, J.
